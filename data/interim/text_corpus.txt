The aircraft landed safely in Las Palmas.The AAIB released their special bulletin without conclusions yet analysing:The aircraft took off from Runway 09 with a thrust setting significantly below that required to achieve the correct takeoff performance. Rotation for the takeoff occurred only 260 m before the end of the runway and the aircraft passed over the end at a height of approximately 10 ft. The N1 required to achieve the required takeoff performance was 92.8% but, following an A/T disconnect when the crew selected TOGA, 84.5% was manually set instead. Despite an SOP requirement to check the thrust setting on takeoff, the crew did not realise that the thrust was not set correctly until after the takeoff although they had noted how close to the end of the runway they were.The A/T had disconnected when the TOGA switch was pressed due to a fault with the ASM associated with the thrust lever for engine 1. This disconnect was a known issue with the older type ASMs fitted to the aircraft type. The manufacturer has issued a Fleet Team Digest for operators detailing the issue and the SB for replacing the ASMs with a newer model.

There was no damage to the aircraft and there were no injuries. An internal investigation has been initiated, UAE's GCAA also opened an investigation.United Arab Emirates' GCAA released their final report concluding the probable causes of the serious incident were:The Air Accident Investigation Sector determines that the causes of EK524 flight crew to commence a take-off roll without clearance were:(a) When AIRS enquired the flight crew for readiness for departure, the crew perceived that as a clearance for takeoff from runway 30R.(b) When the flight crew switched the radio frequency to AIRN, they were granted a clearance to line up which was mistakenly perceived as take-off clearance.(c) The flight crew were in assumption that takeoff clearance was given and they did not expect the crossing of EK568 on the active runway as it was not communicated or warned by ARIN to the EK524 crew.(d) The visibility of flight crew for the crossing aircraft was hindered by the long distance between the EK524 position and holding point Mike 5, the ongoing work, and night time.(e) The flight crew carried out a rolling takeoff and did not stop after lining up on runway 30R assuming that clearance to takeoff was given.(f) The flight crew did not monitor the communication between AIRN and the aircraft crossing runway 30R as they were engaged in accomplishing the before takeoff checklist.The GCAA summarized the sequence of events:... at 1800:07, the stop bar lights went off and EK524 Aircraft commenced movement.At 1800:14, AIRS controller instructed the crew to hold position and the stop bar lights turned red, but there was no response by the crew. The Commander stated that at the moment they received the instruction to hold position, the stop bar lights were off, and thereafter he attempted to stop the Aircraft. He thought the nose of the Aircraft passed the stop bar whereas the nose landing gear was still behind when the Aircraft stopped.At 1800:19, AIRS controller repeated the instruction to hold position and the crew confirmed.At 1800:26, AIRS controller advised the crew that the stop bars were off then turned on after 60 seconds, as default. The crew replied that the stop bar lights were on and they called AIRS controller to switch them off in order to move, and AIRS controller switched it off accordingly. The crew stated to AIRS controller that stop bar lights were switched on after the Aircraft had stopped based on the second instruction to hold position.At 1800:58, AIRS controller cleared the Aircraft to cross runway 30L behind the landing of Algeria Airbus 330 aircraft, and the flight crew read back the clearance correctly. The flight crew emphasized that they were still behind the stop bar. AIRS controller confirmed that he was monitoring the Aircraft on the surface movement radar and mentioned that he thinks it was a fault in their system.At 1802:16, AIRS asked the flight crew if they are ready for departure, and the flight crew confirmed that. AIRS controller then cleared the Aircraft to taxi to holding point Mike 15A, and the flight crew read back the clearance correctly.At 1802:37, AIRS controller requested the flight crew to contact Air North controller (AIRN) on frequency 118.75 MHz.At 1802:46, the Commander contacted AIRN controller who instructed the crew to line up with runway 30R by stating Emirates five two four line up runway 30 right., and the Commander read back Line up runway 30 right Emirates five two four. The Commander, as the PM, turned on the landing light as per the SOP action. The airport surface movement radar showed the EK524 Aircraft crossed holding point Mike 15A and continued lining up on the runway at 1803:08.At 18:03:35, the crew of the other aircraft (EK568) called AIRN reporting Dubai tower good evening emirates five six eight heavy holding short runway three zero right mike five alpha. AIRN instructed the crew by stating Emirates five six eight good evening mike five alpha cross runway three zero right expedite after crossing right november holding point november niner. The crew read back the AIRN controller instructions and commenced to cross runway 30R.At 18:03:43 UTC, EK524 has lined up and the ground speed was indicating 11 knots based on the ground movement radar (GMR). At 1804:04, while the Aircraft was accelerating at 97 knots ground speed, AIRN noticed its roll and immediately instructed the flight crew to hold position, but the flight crew did not respond.At 1804:10, AIRN repeated the instruction to the flight crew to stop immediately, and the flight crew did not acknowledge the instructions, but they started to stop the Aircraft. The Aircraft stopped at a position abeam taxiway Mike 9 at 1804:26, which was 1,000 meters short of Mike 5A, after reaching a maximum ground speed of 125 knots. After the Aircraft came to rest, AIRN contacted the crew to emphasize that they were not cleared for takeoff.At 1806:23, AIRN controller handover commenced which contained the pertinent information on the traffic information but not on the rejected takeoff in specific.At 1807:06, the Aircraft exited the runway as per AIRN instructions via November 4 to taxiway Papa.AIRN controller handover was completed at 1807:12.At 1810:33, Ground Movement Planner contacted the Airside Operations and requested a runway inspection on runway 30R after clearing, which was completed at 1819:13.The Aircraft remained on the taxiway for 15 minutes for the crew to evaluate the occurrence with the maintenance control center before reporting ready for taxi.Thereafter, the crew were cleared to taxi for departure in sequence and subsequently the Aircraft departed at 1834:15.
According to media reports (including some aviation reports) a Lufthansa B748 nearly collided with a South African Airways Airbus A320 on the runway in Johannesburg. The (known as highly inaccurate) replay-display by a certain radar website shows, that the B748 while accelerating for takeoff from Johannesburg's runway 03L had a South African Airways A320 cross the runway at the same time in short distance across the first taxiway ahead of the B748, the A320 made it across the runway before the B748 came to that point, the B748 continued takeoff. So this is the "story" of a "near collision on the runway" according to such media.However, what really happened is this:The B748 was cleared to line up runway 03L and lined up. The crew disliked the view on their weather radar and decided not to continue with their takeoff. They vacated the runway and returned to the holding point runway 03L. In the meantime, because the Lufthansa was now taxiing, tower cleared the A320 to cross the runway. After the B748 returned to the hold short line, the A320 had long crossed the runway, the B748 departed without further incident. All safe, all normal, end of real story. No near collision on the runway, no runway incursion occurred, no close proximity of aircraft occurred, no rejected takeoff occurred, ...According to detailed raw ADS-B data the Boeing 747-8 lined up runway 03L between 18:15:00Z and 18:16:04Z, then waited in position until about 18:17:23Z then taxied, never exceeding 25 knots over ground, down the runway to vacate the runway and rejoin the hold short line before departing. During the actual takeoff run starting at about 18:42:00Z the aircraft had already accelerated to 41 knots over ground before the aiming markers (the aircraft had passed with 13 knots over ground on the first supposed/reported "takeoff run") and had further accelerated to 70 knots over ground just past the first fixed distance markers (which the aircraft had passed at 21 knots over ground during taxi, the first supposed/reported "takeoff run").Map including trajectories (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):
An Air New Zealand Dash 8-300, registration ZK-NEF performing flight NZ-8190 from Timaru to Wellington (New Zealand), was accelerating for takeoff from Timaru's runway 02 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (above 100 knots over ground). The aircraft slowed and came to a stop at the end of the runway with the nose gear off the paved surface of the runway.The airline reported the crew rejected takeoff over concerns due to bird activity around the aerodrome. The aircraft stopped on the runway and will remain there until procedures are being completed.New Zealand's CAA reported they have been notified about the occurrence and have in turn notified New Zealand's TAIC (Transport Accident Investigation Commission).New Zealand's TAIC stated they have opened an inquiry into the occurrence stating that the aircraft aborted an attempted takeoff at speed and stopped at the end of the runway.ADS-B data suggest that the aircraft's nose gear may have gone past the runway end onto soft ground.Timaru unattended aerodrome features a runway 02/20 with an ASDA of 1280 meters/4200 feet. The aerodrome chart contains a note: "CAUTION: Bird hazard. Birds seasonally on aerodrome and larger number present on the outlying fields when irrigation or cultivation taking place."The aircraft after coming to a stop:The aircraft after coming to a stop (Photo: Hayden Brown):

A CanaryFly Avions de Transport Regional ATR-72-212A, registration EC-MSM performing flight PM-617 from Las Palmas,CI to Tenerife North,CI (Spain) with 18 passengers and 3 crew, was cleared for a rolling takeoff from Las Palmas' runway 03L when the crew after aligning with the runway spotted a vehicle on the runway and rejected takeoff. After the vehicle left the runway, the aircraft departed normally.On Jan 16th 2024 Spain's CIAIAC reported that tower had cleared a maintenance vehicle onto the runway just second earlier, when the vehicle was entering the runway from threshold 21R tower just cleared the ATR for takeoff. The CIAIAC released their final report in Spanish only ((Editorial note: to serve the purpose of global prevention of the repeat of causes leading to an occurrence an additional timely release of all occurrence reports in the only world spanning aviation language English would be necessary, a Spanish only or no release does not achieve this purpose as set by ICAO annex 13 and just forces many aviators to waste much more time and effort each in trying to understand the circumstances leading to the occurrence. Aviators operating internationally are required to read/speak English besides their local language, investigators need to be able to read/write/speak English to communicate with their counterparts all around the globe). The report concluded the probable causes of the incident were:Lack of adherence with procedures by the controller, as the controller cleared PM-617 to enter the runway and take off although the runway was occupied causing a runway incursion on 03L.Contributing factors were:failure of the supervising controller to execute recommendations resulting from previous incidents, not paying special attention to runway checks.
A Jetblue Airbus A321-200, registration N995JL performing flight B6-355 from New York JFK,NY to Ontario,CA (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from JFK's runway 31L when the crews of other aircraft waiting for departure reported their right hand engine was on fire and emitting sparks, the A321 rejected takeoff at low speed. The Jetblue crew advised they had lost their second engine (V2533, right hand), other crews reported there had been flames from the right hand engine and it was now just glowing, a faint glow. The Jetblue crew offered to vacate the runway, vacated the runway onto taxiway Y and stopped on the taxiway for an inspection by emergency services. Another crew chimed in reporting a flock of birds had just risen from the runway at the time and region when and where the engine failure occurred. Emergency services requested the A321 to shut their engines down, the crew advised they had no APU and would lose power if they shut their #1 engine down. Emergency services reported the #2 engine was a little bit hot, but no smoke and no fire. After the inspection the A321 returned to the apron.A replacement A321-200 registration N950JT reached Ontario with a delay of about 5.5 hours.

An Allegiant Airbus A319-100, registration N306NV performing flight G4-803 from St. Petersburg,FL to Norfolk,VA (USA) with 123 passengers and 6 crew, was cleared to and performed takeoff from St. Petersburg's runway 18. In the initial climb, at about 140 feet AGL, the crew needed to take evasive action to avoid a collision with a private Cessna carrying just the pilot, that was crossing midfield over the runway at 300 feet on a right downwind for runway 22. After being clear of conflict the A319 continued the climb and continued to Norfolk for a safe landing.The NTSB reported the occurrence had been rated an incident (?), stating it was a near midair collision, and is being investigated.On Sep 23rd 2023 the NTSB released their final report and the investigation docket reporting the minimum separation was 100 feet vertically and 360 feet horizontally and concluding the probable cause of the incident (again ?) was:The air traffic controllers failure to properly scan the runway and local area, and their general loss of situational awareness, resulting in a near midair collision. Contributing to the incident was the Cessna 337 pilot's poor decision making when he failed to fly the standard downwind leg distance from the runway and to maintain the standard traffic pattern altitude.The NTSB analysed:Review of the radar data showed that N370SD, a Cessna 337, was on a right downwind for runway 22 at 300 feet when it overflew runway 18, and at the same time Allegiant Air flight 803 (AAY803), an Airbus A319, was at 200 feet departing runway 18. The closest proximity was 100 feet vertically and 369 feet laterally. The crew of AAY803 saw the Cessna 337 and took evasive action by stopping their takeoff climb and maintaining 200 feet, and flew underneath the Cessna 337, which was at 300 feet as the airplanes paths intersected over the runways.The local controller did not visually scan all runways and airspace when he instructed the Cessna 337 pilot to enter a right downwind, and again, when he issued a takeoff clearance to the Allegiant Air flight; the lack of fully scanning all runways and airspace resulted in the local controller losing situational awareness of the Cessna 337, and ultimately not ensuring positive control and separation between the Allegiant Air flight and the Cessna 337. The Cessna 337 pilots downwind leg for runway 22 was significantly less than the standard 1/2 to 1 mile defined downwind leg distance from the runway, which placed the Cessna 337 in a closer vicinity to the runway intersections than what was expected. Additionally, the Cessna 337 pilot did not fly a standard traffic pattern altitude, and the local controller did not instruct or advise the pilot that the traffic pattern altitude was 1,000 feet. PIE airport did not have a charted traffic pattern altitude.

An Indigo Airbus A320-200, registration VT-IFM performing flight 6E-2131 from Delhi to Bangalore (India) with 177 passengers and 7 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Delhi's runway 28 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 45 knots over ground) due to the failure of the right hand engine (V2527) that emitted lots of sparks. The aircraft slowed safely, vacated the runway and taxied to the apron.Delhi Police reported there were 184 people on board, who were not evacuated.Passengers reported the crew announced some malfunction with the right hand engine.A replacement Airbus A320-200N registration VT-IJW reached Bangalore with a delay of about 3 hours.On Oct 29th 2022 India's DGCA reported preliminary investigation results show the right hand engine surged causing loud noise and streaks of flames and sparks in the engine exhaust. There were no injuries.On May 24th 2023 India's AIB reported the #2 engine failed prompting the crew to reject takeoff, fire was seen from the engine and one fire bottle was discharged into the engine. In the post occurrence inspection outlet guide vanes and high pressure compressor blades were found severly damaged. The occurrence was rated a serious incident and is being investigated by India's AIB.Passenger photo:
A PIA Pakistan International Airlines Airbus A320-200, registration AP-BMV performing flight PK-326 from Quetta to Islamabad (Pakistan), was accelerating for takeoff from Quetta's runway 31L when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 110 knots over ground) due to a windshear warning. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron with overheating brakes.Pakistan's CAA reported: "Pilot aborted the take-off after warning indication in the cockpit in response to shearing winds and plane's overheating brakes."The aircraft is still on the ground in Quetta about 10 hours after the rejected takeoff.
An Aeromexico Boeing 737-8 MAX, registration N868AM performing flight AM-117 from Mexico City to Ciudad Juarez (Mexico), was cleared for takeoff from runway 23R, commenced takeoff and was accelerating through 80 knots over ground when the crew rejected takeoff upon ATC instruction. The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway.Tower had previously cleared a Viva Aerobus Airbus A321-200, registration XA-VBU performing flight VB-1503 from Nuevo Laredo to Mexico City (Mexico), to land on Mexico City's runway 23L, vacate the runway via taxiway B4 and hold short of runway 23R, which the crew complied with and held short of the runway for more than 4 minutes while several takeoffs commenced. While issuing a series of instructions to various aircraft it appears the tower controller misspoke a callsign seemingly clearing VB-1503 to cross the runway, the crew commenced crossing the runway. Shortly afterwards AM-117 was cleared for takeoff, the VB-1503 crew attempted to radio a warning they were just crossing the runway, the transmission however was partially blocked and not heard. The tower controller became aware of the VB-1503 on the runway and instructed AM-117 to reject takeoff still believing VB-1503 had crossed the runway without clearance.AM-117 returned to the apron for a check and departed 4 hours after the rejected takeoff.
A REX Regional Express Saab 340B, registration VH-ZRC performing a flight from Flinders Island,TA to Burnie,TA (Australia) with 25 passengers and 3 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Flinders Island when the crew rejected takeoff after the aircraft veered to the left and the crew observed abnormal airspeed indications. The aircraft slowed and came to a stop with 4 landing gear tyres deflated.Australia's TSB reported the aircraft sustained minor damage and opened a short investigation into the serious incident.On May 17th 2023 the ATSB released their final report concluding the probable cause of the serious incident was:Contributing factors- The parking brake handle was likely not completely reset (seated in the panel) by the pilot, resulting in residual pressure remaining in the brake system.- Residual pressure in the brake system resulted in a partial application of the brakes during taxi. This allowed heat to generate within the brake system resulting in a gradual increase in brake application.- The significant and increasing drag associated with the partially applied brakes resulted in a flat spotted tyre and all of the main landing gear wheel fusible plugs activating during the take-off roll. The ATSB analysed:On 4 November 2022, a Saab Aircraft Co 340B operated by Pel-Air Aviation Pty Limited, taxied for runway 32 at Flinders Island Airport. During the take-off roll, the aircraft veered to the left and did not accelerate as expected. The crew rejected the take-off and subsequent inspection identified that one tyre was flat spotted and all the main landing gear tyres were deflated.Subsequent post occurrence rectification and system testing was carried out. No defects or unusual wear was identified on the replaced components other than signs of overheating. The brake system and parking brake system, including handle operation, was tested with no faults identified. The aircraft was released for service with no further brake related faults reported.Significant tyre marks, from all 4 main landing gear wheels, were observed on the runway after the occurrence. These tyre marks commenced early in the take-off roll and continued to the disabled aircraft. This evidence, as well as a review of the engine parameters from the flight data recorder and reports from the flight crew, identified that the occurrence was brake-related and not an issue with aircraft propulsion. The brake system, consisting of 2 separate hydraulic circuits, an inboard and an outboard circuit, share a common return line. For all 4 brakes to be applied and overheat the wheel assemblies, a fault would have had to occur in both systems simultaneously or in the single hydraulic return line.The pilot conducted an immediate 180° left turn from the hardstand as the taxi commenced. This is evidence that the parking brake was released to the extent necessary for pressure to reduce below 900 psi and the PARK BRK ON annunciator to extinguish. The pilots observed that there were no cautions present prior to the take-off roll. The pilot also noted that the aircraft was able to be taxied with no abnormal handling or any extra engine power required however the pilot also reported taxiing slower than usual, to allow cabin crew to prepare the cabin, which may have masked any brake application.If the parking brake handle is not completely seated by the pilot, the common return line from both brake hydraulic circuits will be partially obstructed within the parking brake valve. This will restrict hydraulic fluid from flowing out of the brake system, slowing down the rate at which pressure is relieved, resulting in a partial application or dragging of the brakes. During the taxi out, the partially applied brakes created heat due to friction resulting in further brake application to the restricted system as the temperature increased.As the aircraft commenced the take-off roll, heat from the dragging brakes increased rapidly due to the acceleration of the wheel assemblies. At 46 knots the aircraft veered to the left, likely as a result of the left tyre locking and skidding. The pilot corrected towards the runway centreline and continued with the take-off. At approximately 80 knots the pilots observed that the aircrafts acceleration rate had reduced and the take-off was rejected.The pilot commented that, when they reduced power, and prior to manually applying the brakes, the aircraft slowed as though the brakes were applied. This was likely a combination of an application of the brakes and the tyres deflating as identified by the change in runway tyre marks. The tyre marks had changed from a solid tyre mark for the left outboard wheel to a set of parallel lines for each individual wheel. These parallel lines are a result of the weight of the aircraft acting only on the edges of the wheel rim through the tyre to the runway, indicative of a deflated tyre. This is evidence that that the core of the fusible plugs had melted due to a build-up of heat in the wheel assemblies, resulting in the tyres deflating during the latter stage of the take-off roll. The pilot commented that when they then applied the brakes, they felt pressure in the pedals and likened it to the parking brake being set.Consideration of all the available evidence supports a conclusion that the push-pull parking brake handle was likely not completely seated in the console resulting in the parking brake valve partially restricting the hydraulic return line. This residual pressure allowed a partial application of the brakes, or an incomplete release of the brakes, at the commencement of the taxi, resulting in the brakes dragging. This resulted in the generation of heat in the brake system, a continual increase in brake application and the rejected take-off.

The aircraft slowed and became disabled on the runway about 3100 meters/10300 feet down the runway. The runway needed to be closed and is currently still closed about 4 hours after the rejected takeoff (however, no NOTAM has surfaced).A ground observer reported briefly seeing flames from the right hand side.The airport reported the aircraft developed technical difficulties following a bird strike. As result of the rejected takeoff the runway needed to be closed.
An Alaska Airlines Boeing 737-800, registration N525AS performing flight AS-1263 from Los Angeles,CA to Redmond,OR (USA), was cleared for takeoff from Los Angeles' runway 25R and was accelerating for departure when about 50 seconds after receiving the takeoff clearance the crew announced they were aborting takeoff on the runway advising they had hit some foreign object debris on the runway, cabin said about 10-15 feet long, probably a piece of rubber. The piece was probably between the 10 and 9 marker. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron, the crew advising they were concerned about the debris having gone into their engines.The aircraft remained on the ground for about 13 hours and just now returned to service.The FAA reported: "AIRCRAFT STRUCK A PIECE OF RUBBER ON DEPARTURE ROLL, ADBORTED DEPARTURE AND RETURNED TO GATE, LOS ANGELES, CA.", the damage was "UNKNOWN".Metars:KLAX 120253Z 26008KT 2 1/2SM BR OVC003 12/11 A2995 RMK AO2 SLP142 VIS SW-NW 1 T01220111 53000=KLAX 120250Z 26008KT 2 1/2SM BR OVC003 12/11 A2995 RMK AO2 VIS SW-NW 1=KLAX 120225Z 27008KT 1SM R25L/P6000FT BR OVC003 12/11 A2995 RMK AO2 T01220111=KLAX 120153Z 27009KT 2 1/2SM BR OVC004 13/11 A2995 RMK AO2 SLP142 T01280111=KLAX 120148Z 26009KT 2 1/2SM BR OVC004 13/11 A2995 RMK AO2=KLAX 120053Z 25010KT 10SM OVC006 14/12 A2995 RMK AO2 SLP142 T01390117=KLAX 112353Z 27009KT 9SM OVC005 14/12 A2996 RMK AO2 SLP143 T01390117 10161 20133 58015=KLAX 112253Z 26008KT 10SM OVC008 14/12 A2997 RMK AO2 SLP148 T01440117=KLAX 112153Z 27009KT 10SM OVC008 16/12 A2999 RMK AO2 SLP154 T01560122=
An Aerosucre Boeing 737-200, registration HK-5192 performing a flight from Puerto Carreno to Bogota (Colombia) with 5 crew, departed Puerto Carreno's runway 07 when one of the engines showed overheat indications and lost thrust. The crew continued takeoff, managed to climb just above treetops, electrical power lines and houses past the end of the runway outside the aerodrome, and returned to Puerto Carreno for a safe landing a couple of minutes later.A video, that became viral, shows the aircraft a low height crossing just above the wires, treetops and roofs of houses about 250 meters/800 feet past the runway end. The trees immediately reacted to the aircraft's wake turbulence (however, no actual contact between aircraft and trees is visible) leading to claims the aircraft had hit the treetops, which dropped leaves as result.Company pilots reported later, that one of the engines had overheated and power was lost from the engine, which climbed out at only 50% thrust available. The aircraft returned to Puerto Carreno for an emergency landing a few minutes later.On Mar 4th 2022 Colombia's Aeronautica Civil reported the occurrence was rated a serious incident and is being investigated by Colombia's Direccion Tecnica de Investigacion de Accidentes (CDTIA). The CDTIA released their preliminary report in Spanish summarizing the sequence of events as follows:The aircraft commenced takeoff on runway 07 at maximum takeoff power, winds from 060 degrees at 4 knots in daylight visual meteorologic conditions, V1 had been computed at 130 KIAS, Vr at 132 KIAS and V2 at 138 KIAS. According to the crew reports all parameters remained normal during the takeoff roll, the aircraft rotated and became airborne, the landing gear was selected up, while the gear was moving the aircraft struck the top of a tree. Immediately following this contact the left hand engine (JT8D) generator failed and the left hand engine lost power. The crew performed the related checklists and with the parameters present decided to restart the left hand engine. The engine started and stabilized, however indicated high temperatures. The aircraft climbed to 2500 feet, the crew decided to return to Puerto Carreno requesting ground support. The crew was unsure whether the landing gear had been compromised during the contact, the crew extended and retracted the landing gear with satisfactory results. The crew computed Vref at 135 KIAS with flaps at 40 degrees and landed safely on runway 07 about 20 minutes after departure. After landing the aircraft turned around to backtrack runway 07 back to the apron when emergency services reported smoke from the left hand engine, no fire was observed. The crew shut the engine down and taxied to the apron.An inspection of the aircraft the following day revealed vegetation embedded in several joints of the slats, leading edge of the left wing and engine #1, ingestion of vegetation by the left hand engine was evident. The tree struck at position N6.1902 W67.4836 was 14 meters (46 feet) high and located 295 meters past the runway end.On Apr 10th 2023 Colombia's Aeronautica Civil released their final report in Spanish only (Editorial note: to serve the purpose of global prevention of the repeat of causes leading to an occurrence an additional timely release of all occurrence reports in the only world spanning aviation language English would be necessary, a Spanish only or no release does not achieve this purpose as set by ICAO annex 13 and just forces many aviators to waste much more time and effort each in trying to understand the circumstances leading to the occurrence. Aviators operating internationally are required to read/speak English besides their local language, investigators need to be able to read/write/speak English to communicate with their counterparts all around the globe).The report concludes the probable causes of the serious incident were:- Late Rotation caused by extreme conditions of aircraft weight and density altitude, that did not permit the aircraft to achieve a sufficient climb rate, climb angle and altitude to clear the obstacles in the takeoff trajectory- takeoff with more aircraft weight than permitted by performance calculations. This weight together with the density altitude caused the aircraft to cover a longer takeoff roll distance consequently reducing the safety margin to avoid obstacles in the takeoff trajectory causing the aircraft to collide with a natural obstacle immediately after takeoff rotation and during initial climb.Contributing factors were:- Overconfidence by the crew assuming they would lose sufficient weight during taxi for departure rendering their gross weight within the performance calculations- Low situational awareness by crew and dispatch which influenced the decision to continue the takeoff under limited performance conditions- Weaknesses in the operational control and management by the operator's dispatch by not adequately briefing the crew to take into account the atmospheric conditions (ambient temperature, above all) would change at takeoff time and thus would affect the takeoff performance.- Lack of risk management by the crew and the operator's Operational Safety to anticipate the conditions that would affect an aircraft's performance on a limited runway at high ambient temperatures.The investigation analysed that the aircraft weighed an estimated 109,836 lbs (including 16,866 lbs of fuel) at the apron. According to the manual the aircraft's maximum takeoff weight was 109,000 lbs, the minimum fuel needed to Bogota was 15,970 lbs. The investigation found that the weight of three occupants of the aircraft was not included in the weight and balance computations.Based on the assumed takeoff weight of 108,877 lbs the V speeds would have been: V1=128 KIAS, Vr=130 KIAS, V2=137 KIAS.The aircraft actually took off at 108,577 lbs, however, due to the increased ambient temperature at 33.9 degrees C, 1.9 degrees above planned temperature, the maximum takeoff weight was 107,950 lbs, thus the aircraft was 606 lbs over weight. The crew was aware that they were overweight for departure according to CVR transcript, the first officer annotated they were about 500 lbs over weight with 109,036 lbs of takeoff weight (compared to the limit of 108,500 lbs computed for a departure with 32 degrees C). Despite that overweight, with both engines operating, the aircraft should have cleared the obstacle by 90 feet. There had been no engine failure on takeoff. Even IF an engine had failed, the aircraft should have cleared the runway end at 35 feet AGL and the aircraft should have cleared the obstacle by 60 feet.During the takeoff run it was noticed that the captain pushed the yoke forward twice without a change in attitude of the aircraft, a backward pressure became visible only at 138 KIAS. However, the aircraft became airborne only at 151 KIAS. Immediately after the aircraft became airborne and established a positive rate of climb the #1 engine's EPR was lost, when the aircraft hit the tree. It thus is clear that upon applying back pressure there was no positive climb reponse of the aircraft until additional speed had been gained.The first officer reported that he made the rotate call, but the captain did not immediately rotate, perhaps to get more speed for rotation. The CVR revealed complacency by the crew, none of the crew members questioned the takeoff weight or the ambient temperature or suggested to wait until the temperature had dropped again.The investigation analysed that there were surprising similiarities with the crash of another company Boeing 727-200 in the year 2016, see Crash: Aerosucre B722 at Puerto Carreno on Dec 20th 2016, overran runway on takeoff.Ground observer video (Video: Yamid Giraldo):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMTRuxZKIVkThe aircraft back at Puerto Carreno:Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):
An Ariana Afghan Airlines Airbus A310-300, registration YA-CAV performing flight FG-416 from Jeddah (Saudi Arabia) to Kabul (Afghanistan), was accelerating for takeoff from Jeddah's runway 34C when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 135 knots over ground) due to the captain's sliding window experiencing a pressurization leak. The aircraft vacated the runway onto taxiway G and stopped. 7 of 8 main tyres deflated due to hot brakes. The passengers disembarked onto the taxiway.The aircraft remained on the ground in Jeddah for 3 days and 5 hours, then positioned to Kandahar (Afghanistan) and returned to service on Mar 4th 2023.Saudi Arabia's AIB reported that the aircraft experienced a captain sliding window pressurization leak at 01:35L (22:35 UTC Feb 23rd) while taking off runway 34C. The captain performed a high energy abort, all brakes peaked with high temperatures, 7 of 8 main tyres deflated. The aircraft taxied onto taxiway G and safely disembarked all passengers.
A Delta Airlines Airbus A321-200, registration N342DN performing flight DL-1482 from New Orleans,LA to Salt Lake City,UT (USA), was cleared for takeoff from runway 11 and was accelerating for takeoff from runway 11 when tower cancelled the takeoff clearance. The crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 125 knots over ground) and stopped about 1500 meters/4920 feet down the runway. The aircraft subsequently vacated the runway and stopped to work checklists and monitoring the brakes temperatures with the intention to return to the holding point, however, subsequently needed to return to the apron.Tower explained another aircraft had crossed the hold short line of the runway.The aircraft remained on the ground in New Orleans for about 21.5 hours, then departed.The FAA reported: "An air traffic controller cancelled the takeoff clearance for Delta Air Lines Flight 1482 after a Learjet landed at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport and made a wrong turn onto a taxiway. The Learjet never crossed the hold short line. The controller cancelled the takeoff clearance for the Delta Airbus A321 out of an abundance of caution. This incident occurred around 7:45 p.m. local time on March 31."
A Swiss International Airlines Airbus A320-200, registration HB-IJQ performing flight LX-786 from Zurich (Switzerland) to Brussels (Belgium) with 70 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Zurich's runway 28 at 07:57L (06:57Z) when a runway inspection vehicle driving along runway 34 went past the hold short lines at the runway intersection runway 28/34. The aircraft continued takeoff and landed in Brussels without further incident about 50 minutes later.On Mar 31st 2023 Switzerland's SUST reported the occurrence and stated they have opened an investigation into the occurrence. The vehicle involved was a runway inspection vehicle. The SUST wrote: "Bei schlechter Sicht fuhr ein Fahrzeug auf das Pistenkreuz 34/28 zu, während ein Linienflugzeug auf der Piste 28 startete. " (in poor visibility a vehicle drove towards the intersection runway 34/28 while a scheduled line flight was departing runway 28).According to ADS-B data the vehicle was driving along runway 34 south of runway 28 while the aircraft was accelerating on runway 28 east of the intersection, the vehicle subsequently was north of runway 28 after the aircraft had become airborne about 275 meters/900 feet short of the intersection.Metars:LSZH 140850Z VRB01KT 0900 0700N R14/2000U R16/1700N R28/P2000N R34/P2000N FZFG VV002 M00/M01 Q1036 BECMG 1500 PRFG BKN003=LSZH 140820Z VRB01KT 0600 R14/1900U R16/1100U R28/1300D R34/P2000N FZFG VV002 M01/M01 Q1037 BECMG 0800=LSZH 140750Z VRB02KT 0600 R14/1100U R16/1700U R28/1300U R34/1200N FZFG VV002 M01/M01 Q1037 TEMPO 0400=LSZH 140720Z VRB03KT 0600 R14/1300D R16/1400U R28/1200D R34/1600N FZFG VV002 M01/M01 Q1037 TEMPO 0400=LSZH 140650Z VRB02KT 0600 R14/1100N R16/1200N R28/P2000N R34/1700U FZFG VV002 M01/M01 Q1037 TEMPO 0400=LSZH 140620Z VRB02KT 0700 R14/P2000N R16/P2000N R28/1500U R34/P2000N FZFG VV003 M01/M01 Q1036 TEMPO 0500=LSZH 140550Z 10003KT 0700 R14/P2000N R16/P2000N R28/0900U R34/1100N FZFG VV003 M01/M01 Q1036 TEMPO 0500=LSZH 140520Z 10004KT 0700 R14/2000U R16/1200U R28/1000D R34/1900U FZFG VV003 M01/M01 Q1036 TEMPO 0500=LSZH 140450Z VRB02KT 0500 R14/0800D R16/0650N R28/1100D R34/0900U FZFG VV002 M01/M01 Q1036 TEMPO 0300=LSZH 140420Z VRB02KT 0500 R14/0750N R16/0700N R28/0800U R34/0900D FZFG VV002 M00/M01 Q1036 TEMPO 0300=LSZH 140350Z AUTO VRB02KT 0600 0100N R14/0700N R16/0700U R28/0800N R34/0900N FZFG VV002 M00/M01 Q1036 TEMPO 0300=
A Westjet Boeing 737-8 MAX, registration C-FHCM performing flight WS-1681 from New York JFK,NY (USA) to Calgary,AB (Canada) with 165 passengers and 6 crew, departed JFK's runway 04L when during the takeoff roll the crew heard unusual noises from the nose gear. After becoming airborne and selecting the gear up an abnormal indication for the nose gear followed prompting the crew to level off at 7000 feet while troubleshooting the issue. The crew was able to resolve the indication and continued the flight to Calgary. Westjet Dispatch informed Calgary Airport about the nose gear issue about one hour prior to estimated landing. Descending towards Calgary the crew declared PAN PAN and advised they were planning to stop on the runway and needed to be towed to the apron. The aircraft landed safely on Calgary's runway 17L and was able to taxi to the apron on its own power.The Canadian TSB reported, that "the nose landing gear pressure seals failed during the takeoff roll. Loss of pressure in the oleo kept the strut compressed and unable to center before retracting into the gear well. The seals were replaced and an SDR was submitted to Transport Canada. The aircraft was released for continued service."https://flightaware.com/live/flight/WJA1681/history/20230308/2235Z/KJFK/CYYC
A Transavia Boeing 737-700, registration PH-XRX performing flight HV-6051 from Rotterdam (Netherlands) to Alicante,SP (Spain), departed Rotterdam's runway 06 normally, however, on climb out the Mode-S transponder did not transmit any plausible altitude information. The crew soon after takeoff requested to level off, was cleared to maintain 5000 feet. Rotterdam ATC advised they did not receive any altitude information from the aircraft, the crew apparently switched source of the transponder and asked "and now", but ATC again advised still no altitude reading was available. ATC queried about their altitude, the crew reported they "believed" to be at 6500 feet, they were flying on their stand by instruments which they deemed reliable. ATC inquired with military three dimensional radar who informed the aircraft was actually at FL110. The crew decided to divert to Amsterdam and requested runway 06 at Schiphol Airport. On approach to Amsterdam the crew explained they had a normal takeoff from Rotterdam, in the climb they received indications of unreliable airspeed and altitude errors on both captain's and first officer's instruments, they believed their stand by instruments were reliable however. Amsterdam approach also confirmed receiving no altitude readout whatsoever. ATC and crew used another aircraft operating in the vicinity and maintaining FL070 to verify that the aircraft's TCAS indications were still working correctly, the crew reported they were descending through 4400 feet according to their stand by altimeter set to the local QNH, at the time the military radar reported they were at 3200 feet. The crew advised no assistance was needed after landing with the current situation on board. The aircraft landed safely on Amsterdam's runway 06 about 35 minutes after departure from Rotterdam.A replacement Boeing 737-800 registration PH-HXC reached Alicante with a delay of 2.5 hours.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Amsterdam about 24 hours after landing. Prior to the occurrence it had last flown on Feb 19th 2021.On May 11th 2021 the Dutch Safety Board (Onderzoeksraad, DSB) announced, they have opened a short/brief investigation on Apr 29th 2021 stating: "Shortly after takeoff, erroneous altitude and airspeed values were displayed on the captains and first officers instruments. The crew was able to reach adequate airspeed and altitude by use of standby instruments and decided to divert to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, where the aircraft made a safe landing."On Jun 3rd 2021 the DSB reported they are investigating two occurrences, this one as well as Incident: TUI Belgium B738 near Amsterdam on Oct 3rd 2020, unreliable airspeed, where unreliable airspeeds following storage due to the Corona Pandemic had occurred. As result of the investigations so far the DSB stated, that in one case the pitot covers had not been removed, in the other case the pitot pipes had not been properly reconnected, in both cases the crew were able to use visual references outside the aircraft in favourable weather conditions. The DSB stated that EASA well as Boeing had issued warning identifying safety risks of returning aircraft to service after long term storage. The DSB further stated that there is no possibility for flight crews to test the pitot systems prior to departure. The DSB subsequently argues, that the safety risk was known in both occurrences, yet, they did happen. The DSB anticipates that an increasing number of aircraft will be returned to service in the days and months ahead leading to an increase of numbers of non-standard maintenance. The incidents show, that extra attention is needed to address this risk. This is why the DSB issues an interim warning to airlines and maintenance companies of this safety risk.In their quarterly bulletin for last quarter of 2022 issued on Mar 23rd 2023 the Onderzoeksraad (Dutch Safety Board DSB) stated the investigation is still ongoing but released the following conclusions:The erroneous altitude and airspeed indications that manifested immediately after the aircraft had become airborne, were the result of multiple air data modules not receiving valid static air pressure inputs. Three pitot-static lines were not connected properly to their respective air data modules, because the connecting QDFs were likely not fully engaged on the lock pins or not connected at all after the flushing procedure was performed. This presented the flight crew with a hazardous situation in flight. The associated risk was reduced by the fact that they were flying in good weather conditions during the day and could make use of the aircrafts standby instruments.The operator had not designated the pitot-static system as a critical system and the associated critical tasks were therefore not performed at different times or by different technicians. The operator acknowledged the increased risks associated with maintenance action during the return to service procedures and addressed these by revising the associated task card. They issued a new task card after the incident flight, requiring two certifying technicians to independently verify completion of the tasks  in line with treating the pitot-static system as critical - and ensure the connections from the pitot-static system are properly connected. The operator also added notes to the task card to verify proper connection of the pitot-static lines to the air data modules and make sure that the actuation rings of the QDFs are fully engaged on the lock pins and the colored lock ring indicators are visible. The DSB summarized the sequence of events:On 24 April 2021, a Boeing 737-700 was scheduled for a flight from Rotterdam The Hague Airport (the Netherlands) to Alicante-Elche Airport (Spain). Prior to the flight, maintenance staff had performed a routine preflight inspection, including a visual inspection of the pitot-static system, and found no abnormalities. The pilots also performed their routine preflight checks and considered the aircraft in good condition. At 18.32 hours, the aircraft took off from Runway 06. During the takeoff roll, the indicated airspeed and altitude indication appeared normal.After rotation and initial climb, the pilot monitoring did not observe a positive rate of climb on the vertical speed indication and the altitude indication on the Primary Flight Display (PFD). In daylight and visual meteorological conditions, both pilots observed the aircraft was positively climbing by visual reference to the ground through the cockpit windows and they subsequently maintained a pitch of approximately 10 degrees nose up. Around the same time, both pilots noticed a rapid reduction of the airspeed indication and a steady altitude indication of approximately 0 feet on their respective PFDs. Due to the reduction of indicated airspeed, the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) generated a windshear warning, an AIRSPEED LOW alert sounded and the stick shaker system activated temporarily. The airspeed indications reduced to approximately 45 knots (minimum value) and the altitude indications remained at approximately 0 feet for the remainder of the flight. About one minute after takeoff, the flight crew alerted air traffic control by declaring an urgency (PAN-PAN call). The pilot flying continued the climb in a northeasterly direction by visual outside reference and used the standby airspeed indicator and altimeter. The flight crew performed the Airspeed Unreliable non-normal checklist and subsequently determined only the standby airspeed indicator and altimeter to be reliable.Four minutes after takeoff, at the request of Rotterdam Tower, the flight crew switched communications to Schiphol Approach. On several occasions during the flight, the approach controller provided the flight crew with groundspeed and altitude information, based on radar data. Initially, the controller did not have any altitude information, but at a later stage, he was provided with altitude information from the Dutch Military 3D radar system. The aircraft reached an altitude of approximately 11,000 feet.After discussing the situation the crew decided to divert to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. Schiphol Approach informed the flight crew that Runways 06 and 36R were available and the weather conditions to be CAVOK. The pilots descended the aircraft to 3,000 feet and were vectored towards Runway 06. The flight crew indicated they did not require assistance of emergency services after landing. During the approach, the pilots received another GPWS windshear warning at approximately 150 feet altitude. The pilots landed the aircraft 38 minutes after they took off from Rotterdam and taxied to the gate.The DSB also published this analysis so far:On 19 February 2021, the aircraft in question was placed into storage at Rotterdam The Hague Airport. As part of this, the pitot-static system was covered to prevent pitot tubes and lines from becoming blocked (for example by insects, dust or debris). In order to put the aircraft back into a serviceable condition after storage, pitot-, static-, and drain-lines that form part of the air data system had to be disconnected, flushed and reconnected.Procedures for covering and flushing the pitot-static system were performed according to the relevant Boeing Aircraft Maintenance Manuals (AMM), by two certifying technicians and an apprentice.The technicians who reconnected the pitot-static lines to the air data system stated that they believed all the AMM tasks and subtasks had been performed by themselves or the apprentice under their supervision. They did not recall who was tasked to connect the QDFs related to this incident. Due to the design of the QDFs, when properly installed, it is highly unlikely they would disconnect by themselves. It is therefore likely the three QDFs were not correctly connected and fully engaged on the lock pins or not connected at all after the flushing procedure. The certifying technician, responsible for verification of this procedure did not notice the improper connections.The operators engineering department had created a task card, containing a list of AMM tasks to be performed for returning the aircraft into service. This task card is updated regularly according to manufacturer and operator requirements. The technicians performing the flushing tasks were familiar with this procedure on the task card. They had previously used a task card, which contained all the AMM tasks - related to the flushing - as separate items. The latest revision, which was used in this case, only contained a reference to the tasks in the AMM.The AMM provided a detailed step-by-step guidance and reference to perform all the required flushing (sub) tasks. However, the technicians believed not all AMM tasks needed to be performed, due to the simplified presentation on the revised task card and therefor did not consult the AMM. This contributed to the QDFs not being connected correctly.With three QDFs disconnected from the air data modules, these air data modules were not provided the required pitot-static air pressure inputs and therefore were unable to provide the pilots with airspeed and altitude information after rotation.The pilots made use of the standby altitude and airspeed indicator, a procedure which is practiced during training in a flight simulator. Additionally, the pilots were able to maintain outside visual reference in CAVOK daylight conditions and the aircraft could be kept under control. The flight continued uneventfully to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol.
A Southwest Airlines Boeing 737-700, registration N212WN performing flight WN-471 from Baltimore,MD to Chicago O'Hare,IL (USA), was cleared for takeoff from Baltimore's runway 15R and commenced takeoff at 13:58L (18:58Z).A fire and rescue vehicle (ambulance) was cleared to cross runway 10 and hold short of runway 15R at the ARFF road (about 5700 feet/1740 meters down runway 15R), the vehicle however read back to cross runway 10 and 15R. The controller did not correct that read back. The vehicle continued and crossed runway 15R while the Boeing 737 was in their takeoff run. The Boeing 737 continued their takeoff, became airborne and continued to destination without further incident.The FAA reported in their safety summit held as result of other losses of runway separation listing a total of 8 such occurrences, that the aircraft became airborne just before the intersection where the vehicle was crossing. The distance between aircraft and vehicle had reduced to about estimated 173 feet horizontally, by the time the aircraft went past the intersection the vehicle was already about 170 feet past the runway. The FAA rated the runway incursion as Category B (significant potential for collision).Metars:KBWI 122054Z 15004KT 7SM OVC030 11/08 A2985 RMK AO2 RAE12 SLP109 P0000 60000 T01060078 58031=KBWI 121954Z 15006KT 7SM -RA BKN036 BKN043 BKN100 OVC200 11/07 A2989 RMK AO2 RAB52 SLP122 P0000 T01060067=KBWI 121854Z 06006KT 8SM FEW065 BKN170 BKN190 OVC230 10/06 A2991 RMK AO2 SLP129 T01000061=KBWI 121754Z 08006KT 9SM FEW012 BKN170 OVC190 10/07 A2994 RMK AO2 SLP140 T01000067 10106 20044 58044=KBWI 121654Z 07007KT 9SM SCT012 BKN200 BKN250 11/07 A2998 RMK AO2 PRESFR SLP152 T01060067=KBWI 121636Z 09005KT 10SM SCT012 BKN200 BKN250 10/07 A3001 RMK AO2 T01000067=KBWI 121619Z 07006KT 10SM BKN012 BKN200 09/07 A3002 RMK AO2 PRESFR T00940067=KBWI 121554Z 10005KT 10SM FEW011 BKN200 08/06 A3005 RMK AO2 SLP175 T00830061=KBWI 121503Z 00000KT 8SM FEW007 FEW080 OVC200 07/06 A3008 RMK AO2 T00720056=KBWI 121454Z 09004KT 8SM FEW010 FEW080 OVC200 07/06 A3007 RMK AO2 SLP184 T00720056 58006=Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):
A TMA Trans Maldivian Airways de Havilland DHC-6-300 Twin Otter, registration 8Q-MBC performing a flight from Finolhu to Male (Maldives) with 15 passengers and 3 crew, was in its water takeoff run when the the crew rejected takeoff due to insufficient lift for takeoff, the crew attempted to put both engines into reverse but were not able to and thus shut both engines down. The aircraft continue to move forward due to its inertia and collided with water bungalows. Both bungalows and aircraft received damage. The aircraft was recovered to the mooring at Finolhu. There are no reports of injuries.The aircraft was seen at the mooring at Finolhu in the evening of Nov 16th 2021 (see photos below) having suffered a dent and penetration to the leading edge of the right hand wing as well as the right hand propeller being removed and the right hand engine supported by a crane, works going on on the wing and prop/engine.According to ground observers at Finolhu the aircraft collided with a water bungalow during its takeoff run and received damage to its right hand wing.A ground observer reported the aircraft underwent engine and propeller tests on Nov 17th 2021, obviously after an engine change, the two tears at the right hand wing were patched up, the aircraft subsequently departed Finolhu. The aircraft positioned from Finolhu to Male on Nov 17th 2021 and is still on the ground in Male about 5 hours after landing there.On Dec 10th 2021 the Maldives AICC (Accident Investigation Coordinating Committe) released their preliminary report summarizing the sequence of events:Aircraft daily inspection was carried out on 12 November 2021, and there was no record of any open deferred defects listed in the Aircraft Technical Log (ATL). The incident flight was operated by the PIC who was seated on the right seat as it was intended for a training flight for the other crew member. According to the flight crew, no abnormalities were observed in any of the previous flights and on this flight until the aircraft failed to produce sufficient lift for take-off and subsequently the take-off was aborted. As the crew were unable to move the power levers to the reverse position, the crew decided to shutdown both engines.The aircraft moved forward under momentum even after the engines were shut down and collided with water bungalows. As a result of the collision, both the aircraft and the bungalows sustained damages. The RH propeller, RH wing tip and the LH wing were damaged.The aircraft was towed back to the platform by a dinghy.The commander (44, ATPL, 14,706 hours on type) was seated in the right hand seat providing training to the first officer (34, CPL, 4,851 hours on type) in the left hand seat, the commander was pilot flying. The AICC stated: "A Mass and Balance Report produced by the Flight crew before departure was available on the tablet. For both the take-off and landing, the CG remains within limits."The AICC stated to the meteorologic conditions:There was no recorded weather data available at the Finolhu water aerodrome, and the nearest was recorded data was available from Dharavandhoo automatic weather station, which is approximately 25km north-east of Finolhu water aerodrome. At 17:10 hrs on 13 November the weather data was mean winds at 24.5 mph (gusting 30.6 mph) from WSW direction.A weather alert over Baa Atoll was active from 1700 to 1800 hrs on 13 November 2021. A yellow alert was issued at 15:40 hrs on 13 November 2021 suggesting strong winds of 25 -30 mph and gust s of 40mph with rough seas expected.The AICC stated in their iniital findings that the aircraft became airborne for a few seconds. On Mar 21st 2023 the AICC released their final report concluding the probable causes of the serious incident were:a. The take-off direction was inappropriate as the take-off line passes over the water bungalows;b. The crew were unable to apply reverse power after rejecting the take-off;c. The crew were unable to shutdown the engines in a timely manner;d. The crew were unable to turn the aircraft away from the bungalows;The AICC stated:The wing and the right hand propeller sustained minor damages, as detailedbelow:1. Left Wing leading edge dented in three places2. Right Wing tip fairing damaged3. Right propeller  One blade damagedThe AICC analysed:The aircraft attempted to take-off in a North Westerly direction towards a stretch of water bungalows. During the take-off run the aircraft was momentarily airborne and the aircraft settled back on water, the PIC decided to abort the take-off.The crew then attempted to apply engine reverse power to stop the aircraft forward movement, but despite repeated attempts, they were unable to select engine reverse power and hence engaged the fuel shut-off valves to shut down both the engines. In spite of shutting down the engines, the aircraft moved on its own momentum and came in contact with two water bungalows. ...The PIC who was the PF, stated that the weather was below favorable conditions at the time of the incident. He noted that on the incident flight the most favorable take-off path would have been a westerly direction as the wind was from WSW. However, in order to avoid taking-off towards the island or between the island and the water villas (over the walkway between the island and the water villas) the PIC chose a north westerly direction towards the water bungalows (having an approximate height of 7.2 meters above mean sea level). The PIC confirmed that once airborne, he was hoping to level off and turn right slightly and climb out to avoid flying over the water bungalows.For the selected take-off path, the distance from the point where the take-off was seem to initiated up to the water villa with which the aircraft contacted was approximately 2260 ft.The Crew had the option of selecting other paths for take-off. Had the crew moved further out (north-east) before lining up for take-off, where adequate take-off distance was available, ensuring clearance from the water bungalows. Thus, the decision taken by the PIC to initiate the take-off run from where he did, instead of taxiing out further north-east, is construed as a contributing factor.The G950 (Garmin G950 flight management system) data suggests the aircraft lifted off within 23 seconds into the takeoff run and the aircraft appeared to be off the water for about 3 seconds covering a distance of about 164 feet. When the aircraft settled back on water, the aircraft was approximately 750 feet from the water villas.The PIC recalls that as soon as the aircraft was airborne, an unfavorable gust of wind caused the aircraft to settle back on water. The G950 data also indicated that, at around the same time, engine power on both engines was reduced to idle thus indicating the take-off was aborted at that point....According to both the crew members, while rejecting the take-off, the PIC moved the power levers to ground idle, but was unable to move the power levers to the reverse position. The PIC stated that three attempts were made to move the power lever aft of the gate position, while verbally calling out his actions. The FO suggested to shut off the fuel but the PIC decided and advised the FO to try and engage the reverse as the situation could be brought under control once the reverse power is applied. Hence a fourth unsuccessful attempt was made to engage reverse power. The PIC finally permitted the FO to shut off the fuel and subsequently propeller blades were feathered.Immediately after the propeller blades were feathered, the aircraft veered further towards left and continued to move forward, under momentum, until the aircraft came in contact with the water villas in front.Failure to move the power levers aft of the gate position could be attributed to the following two main reasons:1. The position of both propeller levers not at full forward (fully fine) position would mechanically lock the power levers at the flight idle position (also known as gate position); hence the power levers cannot be moved aft of the idle position. (TMA Operations Manual Part B  Vol I float Operation Issue 2 Rev 4 dated 11 Jul 2017, under 2.7.7.3  Landing Procedures  under clause 15, a caution states that the reverse power cannot be applied unless BOTH the propeller levers are at full forward position) The power lever linkage is designed to mechanically lock the power lever being pulled aft of the flight idle position whenever any one of the propeller levers is not fully forward.2. If the crew operating the power lever fails to twist the power lever grips to overcome the mechanical stop while attempting to reverse, the power levers will not move beyond the mechanical stop.During the investigation, both the power levers and propeller levers were checked for full and free movement and both power levers and both the propeller levers were found to be functioning satisfactorily with no mechanical failures or restrictions. . The LH engine was run and when reverse was selected, the engine responded accordingly. The RH engine was not run due to damages on the propeller blade. The operation ruled out any mechanical malfunction of the power levers.At the time of rejecting the take-off, the Np of both the propellors were below the maximum which indicated that the propellor levers were not fully forward. The propellor levers may have moved back due to aircraft bumping on waves during the take-off run in the rough weather. Experience of the operator has shown that the propellor levers move back during bumpy takeoff uns. In this occurrence, it would appear that the propellor levers have moved back from the fully forward position as indicated by the propellor Np values....Hurry-Up Syndrome is defined as any situation where a pilot's human performance is degraded by a perceived or actual need to hurry or rush tasks or duties for any reason. These time-related pressures include the crew desire to meet a restriction in clearance time, the pressure to keep on schedule when delays have occurred due to weather, or the inclination to hurry to avoid exceeding duty time regulations, and many other situations.It was noted that the crew had strong concerns relating to completing last scheduled flight of the day from MLE to Rangali island before the twilight ends. Crew were also aware of the unfavorable weather situation and its potential to delay the impending take-off and the possibility that they may not make it to the final destination for the night before twilight ends. Considering nearing completion of a very long day, it can be deduced that crew performance would have tended to wane....Based on the above twilight end time the crew would have 61 minutes from the time of the incident, which occurred at 17:11 hrs, to complete the last flight before twilight ends.The shortest possible flight distance (straight line) from FIN to MLE is 60.48 nm and the distance from MLE to Conrad Maldives water aerodrome is 59.83 nm. To cover both flights approximately 61 mins of flying time is required based on average cruising speed of 120 knots. This does not include any air traffic delays and the turnaround time at MLE.Considering the circumstances, the crew appear to be under pressure to return to main base and complete the last flight of the day to Conrad Maldives water aerodrome at Rangali island, Alif Dhaalu atoll. There was very limited time left to complete both the flights before the twilight ends in Rangali island, and therefore it is highly likely that the Hurry-up syndrome would have contributed to this incident.The aircraft seen at the mooring on Nov 16th 2021 undergoing repairs:The approximate trajectory of the aircraft, beginning its takeoff run from the floating platform (Graphics: AICC):Map (Graphics: Google Earth):
A LOT Polish Airlines Embraer ERJ-175, registration SP-LIB performing flight LO-481 from Warsaw (Poland) to Oslo (Norway), was cleared for takeoff from runway 15 and was accelerating for takeoff when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed reporting some failure indication. The crew slowed safely and stopped well clear of the intersection with runway 11. Tower queried whether a runway inspection was needed, the crew advised a runway inspection was not needed. The aircraft subsequently vacated the runway via taxiway O1, about 500 meters/1650 feet short of the runway intersection, and returned to the holding point runway 15.An Enter Air Boeing 737-800, registration SP-ESC performing flight ENT-51UA from Basel/Mulhouse (Switzerland/France) to Warsaw (Poland), was on final approach to Warsaw's runway 11 cleared to land and continued landing crossing the runway intersection about one minute ahead of the takeoff clearance on runway 15.However, there are media reports in Poland claiming the Embraer rejected takeoff because of a loss of separation and conflicts on the runway between the two aircraft.The occurrence Embraer departed about 6 minutes after the rejected takeoff. On Mar 18th 2023 The Aviation Herald received information that one of the throttle levers did not advance as expected. The throttle quadrant was replaced on Mar 18th 2023.
A Swiss International Airlines Airbus A320-200, registration HB-JLP performing flight LX-560 from Zurich (Switzerland) to Nice (France), received takeoff clearance from Zurich's runway 28, when about 20 seconds later the crew announced they were stopping after rejecting the takeoff at low speed (below 20 knots over ground). The aircraft vacated the runway and returned to the apron.The flight was cancelled.According to information The Aviation Herald received the left hand engine (CFM56) failed. The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground about 26 hours after the rejected takeoff.
An Envoy Embraer ERJ-175 on behalf of American Airlines, registration N258NN performing flight MQ-3338/AA-3338 from Houston Hobby,TX to Dallas Ft. Worth,TX (USA), was cleared to line up runway 13R and wait, however, commenced their takeoff roll.At that time a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737-8 MAX, registration N8725L performing flight WN-2683 from Austin,TX to Houston Hobby,TX (USA), was on short final to Houston's runway 04, which intersects with runway 13R, at about 20:17L (02:17Z Mar 6th).Tower instructed the Embraer to stop and the Boeing to go around resolving the conflict as the Boeing went around from very low height (below 100 feet AGL) and the Embraer slowed. The Embraer was subsequently instructed to vacate runway 13R to their left onto taxiway H about 220 meters/720 feet short of the intersection with runway 04 and was provided with a phone number to call.The Boeing positioned for another approach and landed safely on runway 04 about 9 minutes after the go around.The FAA reported on Mar 13th 2023: "The crew of Envoy Air Flight 3338 began their takeoff roll without clearance on March 5 at William P. Hobby Airport in Houston as Southwest Airlines Flight 2863 was cleared to land on an intersecting runway. At the direction of an air traffic controller, Envoy stopped short of the intersecting runway and Southwest discontinued its landing. The closest proximity of the two aircraft was approximately 4,100 feet."https://flightaware.com/live/flight/SWA2683/history/20230306/0155Z/KAUS/KHOUMetars:KHOU 060353Z 14005KT 10SM FEW250 17/14 A3003 RMK AO2 SLP173 T01720144 $=KHOU 060253Z 13004KT 10SM BKN250 18/14 A3003 RMK AO2 SLP174 T01780144 53012 $=KHOU 060153Z 14006KT 10SM BKN250 19/14 A3002 RMK AO2 SLP168 T01890139 $=KHOU 060053Z 11008KT 10SM OVC250 20/13 A3001 RMK AO2 SLP166 T02000133 $=KHOU 052353Z 11011KT 10SM SCT250 22/12 A3000 RMK AO2 SLP163 T02220117 10261 20222 55004 $=KHOU 052253Z 11011KT 10SM FEW250 24/11 A2999 RMK AO2 SLP160 T02390106 $=Excerpt of Aerodrome Chart Houston Hobby Airport (Graphics: FAA):

An ASL Airlines Belgium Boeing 737-400 freighter on behalf of Fedex, registration OE-IAJ performing flight 3V-4959/FX-4959 from Porto (Portugal) to Liege (Belgium) with 2 crew, was cleared for takeoff from Porto's runway 35 and commenced takeoff at about 21:47L (20:47Z).About 12 minutes earlier tower had cleared a follow me vehicle to perform the nightly runway inspection. The vehicle entered runway 35 and worked northbound reaching the threshold runway 17. The vehicle turned around to now move southbound when the driver saw bright white lights near the threshold of runway 35 which seemed to move and queried with tower whether an aircraft was lining up runway 35. Tower reported an aircraft was in their takeoff run and instructed the vehicle to immediately vacate the runway via the left runway edge.The Boeing crew saw two white lights but weren't sure whether these were runway edge lights due to the night environment. After becoming airborne and in the climb the crew queried with tower about the vehicle and received a reply, that this was a misunderstanding.Portugal's GPIAA reported according to estimation by the vehicle driver as well as preliminary analysis of the ground radar the separation between the vehicle and aircraft reduced to 300 meters. The occurrence was rated a serious incident and is being investigated by the GPIAA.On Dec 30th 2022 the GPIAA released their final report concluding the probable causes of the serious incident were:- The provision of air traffic services with unified tower and approach positions, provided by a single controller without any supervision, working in continuous duty without interruptions for an extended period of time, in a tedious and low-activity environment.- Archaic memory aid system, ineffective and totally dependent on human action to prevent simultaneous use of the runway by vehicles and aircraft.- An inactive RIMCAS system.- Decision process on the application/inhibition of technological tools, in particular the inhibition of RIMCAS, without a risk analysis supported by facts or mitigation measures to allow such inhibition.- The absence of advanced ATC surveillance systems, including multilateration and electronic flight strips which can offer additional protection when compared with traditional, entirely human-dependent systems.- The absence of H24 stop bars procedure or other equivalent lighting systems at all runway holding positions, as recommended by EAPPRI for ANSPs.- Absence of objective criteria set by the organisation for the tactical management of teams by supervisors, based on risk assessment in order to ensure that the required level of safety is not compromised.- ANSP deficient organisational culture, resulting in misrepresentation of the position logs not in line with reality.- NAV Portugals failure to oversee and detect operational, managerial and safety shortcomings over the different Units, namely at Porto and Ponta Delgada towers.- Deficiencies in NAV Portugals safety management system, just culture and its compliance with the requirements of Part-ATS were not identified by the regulator.- Regulators shortfall in properly supervising the Runway Safety Committees at Porto and Ponta Delgada airports, ensuring effectiveness of their activities and compliance with Regulation 8/2018.- The lack of a single frequency for all aircraft and vehicle movements in the manoeuvring area (as recommended by EAPPRI, and others) which would allow both flight crew and ground vehicle drivers to be aware of any possible threats to safety.- Unreliability of the radio scanners which were installed by the infrastructure management in the Follow-Me vehicles at Porto airport, which were not user friendly and for which no formal training had been given to the drivers on how to operate them.- The Follow-Me drivers decision not to actively monitor the aeronautical frequency even though it was not a mandatory requirement.- The non-standardised manner of conducting the runway inspections which, in this case, resulted in a prolonged period of TETRA radio silence.The GPIAA annotated that this conclusion is also valid for another occurrence, see Incident: TAP A21N at Ponta Delgada on May 13th 2022, cleared to land on occupied runway.Aircraft and vehicle estimated positions (Graphics: GPIAA):

A Lufthansa Airbus A320-200, registration D-AIWK performing flight LH-1622 from Munich (Germany) to Krakow (Poland) with 155 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Munich's runway 08R when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (more than 100 KIAS) due a bird strike. The aircraft slowed safely and stopped on the runway abeam taxiway B6 about 1600 meters/5200 feet down the runway. The aircraft needed to hold position until the brakes cooled down, then returned to the apron. A runway inspection found the carcass of a large bird near taxiway B4 about 930 meters/3100 feet down the runway. A replacement A320-200 registration D-AIZA departed about 2 hours after the rejected takeoff and reached Krakow with a delay of about 2.5 hours.
A KLM Boeing 777-200, registration PH-BQE performing flight KL-681 from Amsterdam (Netherlands) to Vancouver,BC (Canada), was accelerating for takeoff from runway 36L when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 50 knots over ground) and vacated the runway advising ATC "they were out of control". The aircraft stopped on the parallel taxiway, the crew worked the related checklists and subsequently decided to return to the apron.After about 30-45 minutes at the apron the aircraft was able to depart again and reached Vancouver with a delay of about 75 minutes.On Nov 17th 2022 the Dutch Safety Board (DSB) reported the occurrence was rated a serious incident and is being investigated preliminarily stating: "During takeoff, the Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System (EICAS) generated a warning in the cockpit regarding the bleed air system, after which the pilots rejected the takeoff."
An Air India Airbus A320-200N, registration VT-EXM performing flight AI-554 from Chennai to Delhi (India), was cleared for takeoff from runway 25, however, began accelerating for takeoff from runway 30. Tower observed the aircraft accelerating on the wrong runway and immediately instructed the crew to stop. The crew rejected takeoff. There were no injuries and no damage.India's AIB rated the occurrence a serious incident and opened an investigation.India's AIB released their final report concluding the probable cause of the serious incident is:The incident occurred due to loss of situational awareness of the flight crew, wherein, the PF started rolling the aircraft on the unassigned runway without ascertaining the intended runway with the available visual cues and improper monitoring of the instruments for the intended runway by PM.Contributory Factors- Not discussing Hotspots (Hotspot 4) during the taxi briefing.- Crew not observing the aircraft Heading when lining up the aircraft on runway 30 (heading 299°) which was not in line with the intended runway 25 (Heading 251).- The crew in a hurry to complete the flight and return home due to festival in mind.- Crew also showing urgency to clear the runway as at the back of their mind they had that there is another aircraft on finals for landing.- Take-off from runway 25/runway30 intersection which crew were not aware at that time.- Take-off clearance was given (for runway 25 not runway 30) when the PF was lining up the aircraft on unassigned runway i.e., Runway 30 which added to the PFs belief that it was the intended runway. The AIB analysed:The aircraft was initially given taxi clearance for departure from Runway 25 via Intersection C. However, the crew in order to have better take-off performance requested Intersection A for departure. The crew did not discuss Hotspot 4 during their taxi briefing. Accordingly, taxi clearance was given by the ATC as per the SOP issued by AAI in this regard. This led to crew being confused, as the departure clearance was given for runway 25 but the taxi instructions given by the ATC mentioned HOLD AT HOLDING POINT RUNWAY THREE ZERO ON A . However, the confusion was cleared when the crew confirmed with ATC about the departure runway. The ATC (Ground as well as Tower) had always mentioned Runway 25 in all of its call out given to the aircraft in respect of clearance for departure runway. The aircraft was given continuous taxi and the lineup clearance (for runway 25) was also given while the aircraft was taxing. After crossing holding point on A the PF turned the aircraft and lined up on runway 30. Due to loss of situational awareness the PF did not observe any visual cues such as runway 30 edge lights (which were blue), runway signage, etc. available at that time to ascertain the intended runway for departure. The PM who was busy in head down duties also did not confirm the runway with instruments. Moreover, the PF also confirmed the take-off runway (as runway 25) without actually ascertaining the same during the before take-off checklist. The take-off clearance was given by the ATC (for runway 25) when the PF was aligning the aircraft on runway 30. Due to this and various other factors the PF at the back of his mind thought that the first runway visible would be the intended runway for departure. This led PF to start rolling the aircraft on the unassigned runway i.e., runway 30 before ATC instructed it to cancel the take-off.Map (Graphics: Google Earth):
An Air Canada Rouge Airbus A319-100, registration C-GBHR performing flight AC-1611 from Fort Lauderdale,FL (USA) to Montreal,QC (Canada), was accelerating for takeoff from Lauderdale's runway 10L when the crew just before V1 observed a small bird and a large bird followed by loud noise and smell. Due to the speed the crew continued takeoff, the crew declared PAN PAN and decided to divert to Miami,FL (USA), where the aircraft landed safely on runway 09 about 45 minutes after departure. The crew suspected a blown tyre, emergency services however found no blown tyre.The Canadian TSB reported maintenance found evidence of a bird strike into the right hand engine (CFM56) without core ingestion and also found evidence of impact on the right hand main gear.The aircraft returned to service about 24 hours after landing in Miami.https://flightaware.com/live/flight/ACA1611/history/20221104/0055Z/KFLL/CYUL
A Batik Air Airbus A320-200, registration PK-LAL performing flight ID-6008 from Perth,WA (Australia) to Denpasar (Indonesia), had reported not ready for departure a few times after being cleared to line up runway 21, then reported ready. The aircraft was accelerating for takeoff from Perth's runway 21 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 30 knots over ground) reporting they had smoke in the back of the cabin, but reported no assistance was needed and taxied to the apron. Tower had emergency services out nonetheless and follow the aircraft to the stand.The aircraft was able to depart about 1:50 hours later and reached Denpasar with a delay of 2:20 hours.
A K-Mile Asia Boeing 737-400 freighter, registration HS-KMC performing flight 8K-804 from Singapore (Singapore) to Jakarta (Indonesia) with 4 crew, departed Singapore's runway 02R when the outer left main wheel failed followed by the inner left main wheel. The crew continued takeoff and continued to Jakarta. Singapore's foreign object debris detection system alerted tower about foreign objects on the runway, a detached panel and tyre debris was found on the runway, a message was sent to Jakarta. The crew who had heard a thud sound during the takeoff roll but couldn't locate the origin, continued, the captain suspecting a tyre failure and deciding they would land in Jakarta using the flat tyre procedure (slowing with reversers only without brake application). The aircraft landed safely on Jakarta's runway 25L uneventfully. During turn off the captain noticed the aircraft was tilting to the left, the leading edge flaps had not fully retracted, too, during taxi vibrations could be felt. The crew stopped taxi and requested assistance, it was found then that both left hand tyres had blown out.Singapore's TSIB released their final report concluding the probable causes of the incident were:- An under-inflation condition probably existed in the previous Wheel #2 tyre (replaced prior to the flight due to air valve leakage) which led to the overloading and stressing of Wheel #1 tyre. This prolonged stressing of Wheel #1 tyre resulted in it failing first during the take-off roll at Changi Airport. The newly replaced Wheel #2 subsequently failed due to overloading from taking on the full load after Wheel #1 tyre had failed.- The aircraft operators recording of tyre pressure was not in line with good maintenance documentation practice. Although the mechanic recalled that the tyre pressure of Wheel #2 tyre was 177 psi, there is no other evidence for the investigation team to corroborate with the mechanics recollection as this tyre pressure was not recorded. The lack of proper recording of tyre pressure had also resulted in the daily check records being amended without proper annotations and countersigning.- The flight time was relatively short and the two AFTN messages sent by the Singapore ATC had not been accorded with an urgent priority indicator. Thus, the Jakarta ATC did not process the information on FOD immediately.- The tyre debris and detached panel, being parts fallen from the aircraft, could have had an impact to safe aircraft operation. Hence the two AFTN messages sent to the Jakarta ATC, which were meant to alert the flight crew, should have been accorded with an urgent priority indicator so that the entity receiving the messages could take timely actions.The TSIB analysed:Possible cause of the tyre failureNoting the result of the examination of tyre debris (paragraph 1.6.3.2), i.e. both Wheel #1 and Wheel #2 tyres had experienced casing rupture and tread separation, the investigation team opined that the sequence of tyre failures is probably as follows:(a) Wheel #2 tyre had been operating in an under-inflated condition, as suggested by the air valve leakage problem of the previous Wheel #2 (which was replaced on 27 September 2021) and the purported tyre pressure of 177 psi before a mechanic replaced Wheel #2.(b) The under-inflation would cause Wheel #1 tyre to be overloaded and to experience increased stress, resulting in tyre failure. After this failure, the load would be transferred to the newly replaced Wheel #2 tyre, which would in turn experience an overloading and a failure subsequently.The investigation team has considered also two other possible causes but found them unlikely:(a) Possibility that Wheel #1 tyre was under-inflatedThe corrosion found on the over-pressure relief valve of Wheel #1 hub could have caused the wheel to lose pressure progressively over time and the tyre to operate in an under-inflated condition, thus stressing the Wheel #2 tyre. If Wheel #1 tyre had indeed been operating underinflated over some time, then Wheel #2 tyre should have incurred some damage. However, this was not the case as no damage was found on the previously replaced Wheel #2 tyre.(b) Possibility of foreign object damageWheel #1 tyre might have been damaged by an FOD. However, no FOD damage was identified on the tyre debris and no FOD was recovered from the runway.On the balance of evidence, the investigation team believes that under-inflation likely existed in the Wheel #2 tyre which had an air valve leakage problem, and was replaced in Bangkok. This under-inflation would then result in the overloading of Wheel #1 and its failure.Maintenance practice by the aircraft operatorThe aircraft operators mechanic who replaced the Wheel #2 on 27 September 2021 following the discovery of an air valve leakage problem claimed that he had noticed the tyre pressure to be 177 psi but did not record the tyre pressure before its replacement. This was not in line with good maintenance documentation practice, as the recording of tyre pressure prior to any tyre replacement would serve as evidence as to whether the tyre pressure was or was not beyond tyre pressure limit and would provide a clue as to the reason of any further tyre maintenance actions.In the course of the investigation, the investigation team came across a number of daily check records where only the BEFORE row of the tyre pressure table were recorded with the tyre pressures of the main landing gear and nose landing gear, even though the aircraft operators mechanics had purportedly performed a top-up of the tyre pressures to the maximum allowed. This gives rise to doubts as to whether the mechanic really did perform the tyre pressure topping up and as to whether, even if they did perform the topping up, they did record conscientiously the measured tyre pressures. The records, as they were, did not allow the investigation team to estimate the condition of Wheel #1 and Wheel #2 tyres prior to the incident and to establish if Wheel #1 and Wheel #2 tyres had been able to maintain pressure over the period of service (i.e. if the tyres had been constantly losing pressure or had operated in an under-inflated condition).The manager had amended the INFLATION and DIFF figures in the daily check records without proper annotations (e.g. the reasons for the amendment) and countersigning. Again this does not accord with good recording practice and may be misleading as the amended daily check records could be mistaken as part of the original document recording when they were not.Transmission of debris information to the flight crew of the incident aircraftWhen the Singapore ATC received the debris information from the aerodrome operator, the aircraft was already under the control of Jakarta ATC. The Singapore ATC therefore sent two AFTN messages to the Jakarta ATC so that the Jakarta ATC could inform the flight crew of the incident aircraft. The first AFTN message on the tyre debris was sent at 0814 hrs and the second AFTN message at 0834 hrs. Owing to the relatively short flight time and the AFTN messages not having been classified as urgent, the Jakarta ATC did not process the messages immediately and the debris information did not reach the flight crew prior to the landing in Jakarta.It is essential that flight crew of aircraft be alerted in a timely manner on issues that may potentially affect the safety of their aircraft, so that they could take appropriate course of actions.According to the Singapore ATC, it follows guidance provided in ICAO Document 44449 on the use of priority indicators for AFTN messages. The guidance mentioned that messages of an urgent nature should be classified as urgent. The two AFTN messages were sent using the GG priority indicator, instead of the DD priority indicator meant for urgent messages. Being from an aircraft, the tyre debris and the detached panel could have had an impact to the safe operation of the aircraft. The investigation team opined that the two AFTN messages should have been accorded an urgent priority indicator.Outer left main wheel #1 (Photo: TSIB):
A Fedex Federal Express Boeing 757-200, registration N785FD performing test flight FX-9030 from Mobile,AL to Mobile,AL (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from runway 14 when a bird impacted the aircraft causing the right hand engine's (PW2037) cowling to separate. The crew continued takeoff, stopped the climb at about 8000 feet and returned to Mobile for a safe landing on runway 14 about 13 minutes after departure.The FAA reported: "AIRCRAFT STRUCK A BIRD DURING TAKEOFF ROLL, LOST ENGINE COWLING TO THE RIGHT ENGINE, ENGINE COWLING CAME TO REST AT THE DEPARTURE END OF THE RUNWAY."https://flightaware.com/live/flight/FDX9030/history/20221025/1600Z/KBFM/KBFM
An Air Canada Boeing 737-8 MAX, registration C-GEPG performing flight AC-775 from Montreal,QC (Canada) to Los Angeles,CA (USA) with 131 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Montreal's runway 06L when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 112 knots over ground) due to an open door indication. The aircraft slowed safely.The Canadian TSB reported, while the aircraft taxied off the runway, the open door indication extinguished.The aircraft remained on the ground for about 2 hours, then departed and reached Los Angeles with a delay of about 2 hours.
An Air France Airbus A320-200, registration F-GKXJ performing flight AF-1623 from Munich (Germany) to Paris Charles de Gaulle (France), was accelerating for takeoff from Munich's runway 26R when the crew rejected takeoff at about 100 knots over ground. The aircraft slowed safely, vacated the runway and stopped on the adjacent taxiway for about 10 minutes. The aircraft subsequently returned to the hold short line of runway 26R and departed about 27 minutes after the rejected takeoff.According to information The Aviation Herald received the crew reported an "unsafe indication" and "pilots' decision" as reason for the rejected takeoff.
A Transcarga International Airlines Airbus A300-B4 freighter, registration YV560T performing flight T9-1527 from Bogota (Colombia) to Caracas (Venezuela), was accelerating for takeoff from Bogota's runway 31R when a loud explosion could be heard far into the surrounding city, a large metallic piece landed on the roads of Bogota at the crossing of Calle 63 and Carrera 103 missing a motorcycle driver by about 10 meters. The crew rejected takeoff due to the failure of the left hand engine (CF6) and brought the aircraft to a safe standstill. There were no injuries.Colombia's GRIAA reported they have opened an investigation to determine the causes of and damage caused by the occurrence, when parts of the left engine of the A300 registration YV560T were ejected. The aircraft had just begun its takeoff run at 00:30L (05:30Z) when the crew rejected takeoff due to the failure of the left hand engine. Initial investigation by the investigators dispatched on site verified that a rotor disk had been ejected, impacted one of the runway safety meshes and subsequently collided with the door of a workshop located in an area surrounding the airport. There were no injuries.On Mar 20th 2021 Colombia's GRIAA reported the aircraft was preparing for takeoff from runway 31R. At the threshold of runway 31R the crew accelerated the engines to about 75% thrust, when a loud bang occurred and the left hand engine shut down. The aircraft taxied back to the apron on its own using the right hand engine. The GRIAA recovered debris from runway and surrouning areas (maximum distance 400 meters) with the most distant part having been the low pressure turbine section. The occurrence was rated a serious incident.Colombia's GRIAA released their final report in Spanish only (Editorial note: to serve the purpose of global prevention of the repeat of causes leading to an occurrence an additional timely release of all occurrence reports in the only world spanning aviation language English would be necessary, a Spanish only or no release does not achieve this purpose as set by ICAO annex 13 and just forces many aviators to waste much more time and effort each in trying to understand the circumstances leading to the occurrence. Aviators operating internationally are required to read/speak English besides their local language, investigators need to be able to read/write/speak English to communicate with their counterparts all around the globe).The report concludes the probable causes of the serious incident were:Failure of the left hand engine caused by fatigue loosening the low pressure turbine blades.Contributing factors were:- Non-Compliance with maintenance procedures by the operator by not complying with the manufacturer's requirements, laid out in FAA Airworthiness Directive 2012-02-07 issued on Nov 1st 2012, which required the replacement of the blades.- Lack of an effective supplier verification programme at the operator and the lack of supervision and verification of borescopic results, which did not permit to identify and apply corrective measures to the erosion found on the tips of the blades during the previous inspection carried out 7 cycles before the occurrence.The left engine seen after the rejected takeoff:The rotor disk at the road:Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):
A Westjet Encore de Havilland Dash 8-400, registration C-FWEW performing flight WS-3114 from Victoria,BC to Vancouver,BC (Canada) with 76 passengers and 4 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Victoria's runway 27 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 78 knots over ground) after receiving a "#2 AC GEN" caution indication. The Canadian TSB reported: "The crew rejected the take-off and a MAYDAY emergency was declared with air traffic control. Once the crew had diagnosed the cause of the warning, the emergency was canceled, and the aircraft was taxied back to the gate without further incident. No one was injured and there was no damage to the aircraft." The TSB reported further that maintenance replaced the No. 2 alternating current generator.
A Corendon Air Boeing 737-800, registration TC-TJU performing flight XC-3562 from Munich (Germany) to Izmir (Turkey), was accelerating for takeoff from Munich's runway 26L when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed due to a takeoff warning configuration. The aircraft vacated the runway and returned to the hold short line and attempted another takeoff from runway 26L, but again needed to reject takeoff at low speed due to takeoff configuration warning. The aircraft again vacated the runway, held at the adjacent taxiway for about 7 minutes then returned to the apron.After about 30 minutes at the apron and maintenance intervention the aircraft was able to taxi out again and this time departed and completed the flight without further incident arriving in Izmir with a delay of about 2 hours.
An Austral Embraer ERJ-190 on behalf of Aerolineas Argentinas, registration LV-CPJ performing flight AR-2439 from Comodoro Rivadavia,CB to Mendoza,MD (Argentina) with 62 passengers and 5 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Comodoro Rivadavia's runway 24 when the crew observed a vehicle crossing the runway ahead. The crew decided, given the distance and speed of the vehicle, to continue the takeoff and continued the flight to Mendoza without further incident for a safe landing.At the time of the occurrence today's runway 07/25 was being built and runway 06/24, now a taxiway between apron and runway, was still the main runway.On Sep 23rd 2022 Argentina's JST released their final report in Spanish only (Editorial note: to serve the purpose of global prevention of the repeat of causes leading to an occurrence an additional timely release of all occurrence reports in the only world spanning aviation language English would be necessary, a Spanish only or no release does not achieve this purpose as set by ICAO annex 13 and just forces many aviators to waste much more time and effort each in trying to understand the circumstances leading to the occurrence. Aviators operating internationally are required to read/speak English besides their local language, investigators need to be able to read/write/speak English to communicate with their counterparts all around the globe).The JST concludes the probable causes of the incident were:- the runway incursion during takeoff of the ERJ-190 was caused by a ground vehicle crossing the runway without clearance.- the communication between vehicle driver and tower was not effective in both directions by not understanding the instruction to not cross the runway and by not requesting to hold short of the runway- the frequency used for ground maneouvering traffic was different to the frequency of the tower- the mitigation measures implemented to prevent runway incursions were not effective.Other safety risk factors:- the criteria to communicate on VHF radio channels (called "Restricted Radio Operator") do not require the knowledge of telecommunication standards and procedures in aeronautical jurisdictions- the airport could have adopted mitigation actions recommended in the guidelines for implementing Surface Movement Guidance and Control SystemsMap (Graphics: JST):

A Ryanair Boeing 737-800, registration EI-EFC performing flight FR-6763 from Tenerife South,CI (Spain) to Bournemouth,EN (UK), was accelerating for takeoff from Tenerife's runway 07 at high speed (about 150 knots over ground). The aircraft slowed safely stopping the aircraft on the runway about 870 meters/2850 feet short of the runway end, however, the brakes overheated and locked up disabling the aircraft on the runway. There were no injuries.Spain's ATC reported the crew rejected takeoff for safety reasons, the brakes overheated and locked up.A passenger reported the aircraft suddenly veered right, then the brakes came on really hard. Fire crews were unable to cool the brakes down. They disembarked about an hour later and were bussed to the terminal.The airport remained closed for about 4.5 hours until the aircraft could be towed off the runway.
An Air Transat Airbus A321-200N, registration C-GOJC performing flight TS-225 from San Francisco,CA (USA) to Montreal,QC (Canada) with 182 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from San Francisco's runway 01R when the crew rejected takeoff due to a suspected unreliable airspeed. The aircraft slowed safely.The crew subsequently assessed that the speed indications had been reliable indeed, it had been a perceiption error during airspeed cross check by the crew. The aircraft taxied to a spot, where they could let the brakes cool. The aircraft was able to perform the flight without further anomalies.
A Wizz Air Airbus A320-200, registration HA-LYI performing flight W6-2274 from Eindhoven (Netherlands) to Budapest (Hungary), was accelerating for takeoff from Einhoven's runway 21 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 140 knots over ground) due to a bird strike.

A subsequent runway inspection found the carcass of a kestrel reporting it didn't appear the bird had gone through the engine.The aircraft is still on the ground in Eindhoven about 6 hours after the rejected takeoff.
A Ryanair Boeing 737-800, registration EI-EBC performing flight FR-2334 from Malaga,SP (Spain) to Amsterdam (Netherlands), was accelerating for takeoff from Malaga's runway 13.An Emergency Medical Service Beechcraft B200 was on final approach to runway 13 at the same time and touched down on runway 13.On Dec 3rd 2020 Spain's CIAIAC reported the horizontal separation between the aircraft reduced to about 0.9nm while the Boeing was still performing the takeoff maneouver. An investigation was opened.On Aug 19th 2022 the CIAIAC released their final report concluding the probable cause of the incident was:The investigation has concluded that the incident occurred due to poor landing and take-off planning, which led to an aircraft being cleared to land on a runway already occupied by another on take-off without respecting the minimum separation requirements.The CIAIAC analysed:The following factors are considered to have played a decisive role in reducing the separation between the aircraft:- The air traffic controllers plan to take advantage of a gap between two aircraft on visual approach to clear the take-off of another aircraft, while the last approaching aircraft was 4.6 NM from the threshold, completing the downwind leg.- The air traffic controllers conditional instruction to align the aircraft on take-off when the first approaching aircraft was 2.4 NM from the runway threshold.- The air traffic controllers decision to take-off an aircraft lined up on the runway when the aircraft on approach was 2.2 NM away....In the incident analysed, the planned take-off window for the RYR7YM traffic was insufficient. Furthermore, the air traffic controller did not take into account the instructions in the LEMG Operating Manual or the aforementioned AESA recommendations. The TWR communicated with ANE8269 and UGC113B in Spanish and RYR7YM in English, which did not help the situational awareness of the crew on take-off. While its true that the approaching traffic could see the preceding traffic on take-off, RYR7YM was given no information about the arriving traffic....The moment of minimum separation between the aircraft occurred at 16:17:17 UTC when aircraft RYR7YM was on take-off run at a speed of 90 kt, and aircraft UGC113B was on short final at 130 kt. The horizontal separation between the aircraft was 0.8 NM. Subsequently, when both aircraft were on the runway, the horizontal separation between them was 0.9 NM. According to provision 4.5.10.1.1 of the Air Traffic Regulations, the minimum separation should have been at least the length of the runway in use, i.e., 3,200 m (1.7 NM). Therefore, the separation between the aircraft on the runway was approximately 53% short of the statutory minimum....As established in Royal Decree 1180/2018, which implements the common rules of the air and operational provisions regarding services and procedures in air navigation, in the operational scenario in this incident, which involves aircraft landing with traffic at the holding point and aircraft on take-off with traffic on final, a single language must be used. In this particular case, English was mandatory because there was a non-Spanish-speaking pilot on the frequency.Therefore, the LCL controller failed to comply with the provisions of Royal Decree 1180/2018 by using the Spanish language with the aircraft on approach and the English language with the aircraft on take-off, which did not favour the situational awareness of the traffic on take-off.

A Spirit Airlines Airbus A320-200N, registration N922NK performing flight NK-3044 from Atlantic City,NJ to Fort Lauderdale,FL (USA) with 105 passengers and 7 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Atlantic City's runway 31 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 60 knots over ground) advising they had a bird strike into the right hand engine (PW1127G) and were stopping on the runway. The aircraft slowed safely and stopped on the runway about 550 meters/1800 feet down the runway, tower queried whether the aircraft needed any assistance, the crew replied "roll the trucks please". A short while later tower advised there appeared to be fire underneath the engine. The crew acknowledged, the fire bell was audible in the background of that transmission, and about a minute later advised they were evacuating the aircraft. 3 passengers and 1 crew travelling as passenger received minor injuries as result of the evacuation.The airline reported a large bird entered one of the engines, the crew braked safely and brought the aircraft to stop, received indication of engine damage and ordered an evacuation in line with standard operating procedures.Videos show the aircraft was evacuated through the left hand forward and left hand aft main doors using slides.On Oct 4th 2021 it emerged, that an entire fan blade had fractured at its root and separated.On Oct 9th 2021 The Aviation Herald received further (detailed) photos of the engine damage by Bart Dieball.On Oct 9th 2021 the NTSB reported the right hand engine received a bird strike followed by engine fire. The flight crew reported receiving an engine fire warning, discharged both fire bottles and rejected takeoff at about 90 KIAS and stopped on the runway. The passengers evacuated via slides, 3 passengers and one dead heading crew received minor injuries in the evacuation. The NTSB opened an investigation.On Jul 5th 2022 the NTSB released their final report concluding the probable cause of the occurrence was:The ingestion of a bird into the right engine during the takeoff roll caused a fan blade to fracture near the blade platform resulting in high fan blade off loads and engine vibrations sufficient to result in an eventual failure of a fuel tube in the right engine that sprayed fuel onto hot engine cases, igniting an undercowl engine fire and triggering a rejected takeoff.The NTSB analysed:Based on the bird remains and feathers collected and identified by Smithsonian Institution National Museum of Nature History Division of Birds - Feather Identification Laboratory, a male immature Blade Eagle was ingested into the right engine striking the fan and causing a single fan blade to fracture near the blade root; the fractured fan blade was contained by the fan case and the remaining fan blades exhibited a combination of leading and trailing edge, as well as blade tip, impact damage, tearing, missing material and bending in the direction opposite rotation. Upon further examination of the engine, it was discovered that two of the thermal management system (TMS) manifold lower aft mounting bracket securing bolts had fractured in shear overstress allowing the bracket to swivel/rotate radially outward. This is one of three mounting brackets that secure the TMS manifold to the engine and prevents excessive moment of the TMS manifold during operation. Along with the broken/sheared TMS lower aft bracket bolts, a crack was visible on the CP-09 fuel line that initiated in fatigue; the CP09 fuel line is attached to the TMS and contains high pressure fuel. The crack in the CP-09 fuel line was due to necking down of the material as the fuel tube bent and stretched (elongated) under the vibration/cyclic loads after the bird strike and not as a manufacturing issue.The TMS manifold lower aft mounting bracket securing bolts fractured due to the high impact and vibration loads because of the fan blade release after the bird strike. Subsequently the TMS manifold was allowed to move radially back and forward from the engine in response to the engine vibrations that were recorded on the flight data recorder to be in excess of the 10 cockpit units which is the highest value that the flight data recorder will record. The CP-09 fuel line flexed, bent, and stretched under the cyclical radial motion of the TMS manifold until it cracked due to fatigue spraying high pressure fuel onto the hot engine cases igniting an undercowl fire.An immature male Bald Eagle has a mean mass of about 4,130 grams (g) (9.1 lbs.). The Federal Aviation Administration large bird ingestion certification test bird weight requirement was 2.75 kilograms (6.05 pounds) for the size of the inlet throat area on the PW1127G-JM geared turbofan engine; thus, the incident ingested bird was larger than the certification basis for the engine.Passenger video of the right hand engine during rejected takeoff (Video: GrecoRoman123):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61dwDQda_NYScenes inside the aircraft (Video: Da Zen Spot):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is3xPah6bMgThe aircraft seen after stopping but before arrival of emergency services:Engine damage (Photos: Bart Dieball):
A Hong Kong Airlines Airbus A330-300, registration B-LNU performing flight HX-709 from Hong Kong (China) to Denpasar (Indonesia), was cleared for takeoff from Hong Kong's runway 07R when the crew of a Cathay Pacific Boeing 747-800, registration B-LJK performing flight CX-71 (dep Dec 22nd) from Anchorage,AK (USA) to Hong Kong (China), advised they were not yet clear of the runway still crossing the runway at taxiway J11 near the end of the runway. Tower in response immediately instructed HX-709 to stop. The crew rejected takeoff at low speed and radioed they were stopping, but were past taxiway J2 about 150 meters down the runway, would like to vacate via J3 and return to the holding point J1. Following taxi the aircraft departed about 8 minutes after the rejected takeoff.Tower had cleared CX-71 to cross runway 07R at J11 about 35 seconds prior to the takeoff clearance for HX-709.Hong Kong's CAD opened an investigation into the occurrence.On Jan 4th 2018 the CAD reported the occurrence was rated a serious incident. The CAD summarized the occurrence briefly: "Shortly after Aircraft 1 was given take-off clearance by Air Traffic Control (ATC), the pilot of Aircraft 2 informed ATC that it was crossing the same runway and had not yet completely vacated the runway. Upon receiving information from Aircraft 2, ATC immediately instructed Aircraft 1 to stop and Aircraft 1 aborted the take-off. Aircraft 2 then continued to cross the runway while Aircraft 1 followed ATC instructions to vacate and line up the runway again for another take-off. "On Jan 25th 2018 Hong Kong's CAD released their preliminary report confirming the sequence of events as reported so far.On Jun 29th 2022 the CAD released their final report concluding the probable causes of the serious incident were:Causes- A take-off clearance was issued to the A333 (AC-DEP) when the B748F(AC-CROSS) was still crossing the runway. The A333 commenced the take-off roll as instructed resulting in a serious incident.- The inappropriate instruction was the result of a momentary lapse of situational awareness caused by distraction.Contributing Factors- An inadequate scanning prior to issuing a take-off clearance to the A333.- No usage of a Runway Blocked strip during the runway crossing of the B748F.The CAD summarized the sequence of events:At time 21:07 on 23 December 2017 a serious incident occurred at Hong Kong International Airport on Runway 07R (RWY07R) when a Hong Kong Airlines Limited Airbus A330-343 (A333) aircraft, given take-off clearance by Air Traffic Control (ATC), commenced the take-off roll while a Cathay Pacific Airways Limited Boeing 747-867F (B748F) aircraft was crossing at the far end of the same runway in accordance with ATC instruction.The flight crew of the B748F aircraft immediately informed ATC that the aircraft was still crossing the runway. ATC immediately instructed the A333 aircraft to stop. The A333 aircraft aborted the take-off and came to a full stop on the runway after rolling for less than 200 metres. The closest distance between the two aircraft was in excess of 3,000 metres. There was no damage to either aircraft and no injury was reported. The B748F aircraft continued to cross RWY07R and taxied to the cargo apron. The A333 aircraft vacated the runway, re-joined the departure queue and subsequently departed RWY07R at 21:14 without further incident.The investigation team has made four safety recommendations.

An Air Canada Embraer ERJ-190, registration C-FMZW performing flight AC-1037 from Toronto,ON (Canada) to Denver,CO (USA) with 87 people on board, was cleared for takeoff from Toronto's runway 06L under visual departure procedures.Immediately when the E190 began their takeoff roll, Tower cleared the Air Canada Boeing 777-300, registration C-FJZS performing flight AC-606 from Toronto,ON to Halifax,NS (Canada) with 359 people on board, to taxi into position and hold on runway 06L. While the E190 was still in their takeoff roll, tower cleared the Boeing 777-300 for takeoff.Shortly afterwards the E190 received a bird strike, the crew decided to reject takeoff at 135 KIAS. The crew radioed tower that they were rejecting takeoff exactly at the same time when the B773 acknowledged their takeoff clearance and commenced takeoff.When the B773 accelerated through 110 KIAS they noticed the E190 was still on the runway and rejected takeoff and managed to stop clear of the E190.Both aircraft were able to vacate the runway, the E190 returned to the apron. The Boeing 777-300 waited on a taxiway for 45 minutes to cool their brakes, then returned to the apron.The Canadian TSB reported there were no injuries and no damage to either aircraft. There was a risk of collision, the TSB opened a Class 3 investigation into the occurrence.In June 2022 the TSB released their final report concluding the probable causes of the occurrence were:Findings as to causes and contributing factors- In order to achieve an expeditious flow of traffic, the controller was using pilot-applied visual departure separation procedures per NAV CANADAs Manual of Air Traffic Services. In this occurrence, the operations conducted under the pilot-applied visual departure separation procedure were optimized to a point where separation was not assured.- Given the Embraer 190s speed and position on the runway, the controller was not expecting a high-speed rejected takeoff. He assessed that the aircraft was becoming airborne and no longer required his attention and monitoring. As a result, he issued the take-off clearance to the Boeing 777 even though the Embraer 190 was still on the runway.- The Embraer 190 struck a bird and conducted a rejected takeoff at a critical point during its take-off roll, just before the Boeing 777 received its take-off clearance and started its own take-off roll.- The first officer of the Embraer 190 made a radio call reporting the rejected takeoff, but this call went undetected by the controller or the Boeing 777 flight crew as it was overlapped by the radio call from the first officer of the Boeing 777 reading back the take-off clearance. As a result, neither the controller nor the Boeing 777 flight crew were aware that the Embraer 190 was rejecting the takeoff.- Because the controller was expecting the Embraer 190 to take off without interruption, he shifted his attention and priority to other aircraft movements. Focus on these tasks, combined with operating from the north tower position, reduced the controller's opportunity to detect the Embraer 190s rejected takeoff and delayed the response to the conflict.- The Boeing 777 flight crew visually sighted the Embraer 190, believed it would soon be airborne, and saw no apparent risk of collision; however, they were unaware that it was conducting a rejected takeoff and decelerating. Proceeding as authorized, the Boeing 777 flight crew commenced their take-off roll while the Embraer 190 was still on the runway, which resulted in a runway incursion and risk of collision.- The Embraer 190s transponder transmitted that the aircraft was in air after the aircraft accelerated past 50 knots. As a result, although compliant with current standards, an inaccurate in-air status was transmitted for approximately 52 seconds while the aircraft remained on the ground during its take-off roll and rejected takeoff.- The runway incursion monitoring and conflict alert sub-system (RIMCAS) relies on data from aircraft systems designed to provide aircraft flight status data for use by airborne surveillance systems. The use of this data by RIMCAS led to the inaccurate identification of the Embraer 190 and the Boeing 777 as in air while these 2 aircraft were still on the ground. This resulted in late and inaccurate RIMCAS alerts and delayed the response to the risk of collision.- A risk of collision occurred when the accelerating Boeing 777 was travelling at 133 knots indicated airspeed and was approximately 5000 feet from the decelerating Embraer 190. The risk was mitigated once the Boeing 777 flight crew rejected their takeoff after recognizing that the Embraer 190 was still on the runway ahead of them.Findings as to risk- If the logic which determines flight status within the runway incursion monitoring and conflict alert sub-system (RIMCAS) has a latency of several seconds, the resulting delays in conflict detection increase the risk that the RIMCAS alerts will be ineffective.The TSB analysed:At the time of the occurrence, the controller planned to coordinate the Boeing 777s departure using pilot-applied visual departure separation behind the Embraer 190. He was using a rapid flow, or cadence, to be as expeditious as possible, in accordance with NAV CANADAs MATS. He was highly experienced, was comfortable with the traffic level, and was managing the workload efficiently. The controller assessed this situation very quickly (in the span of only a few seconds), which was a normal practice. The controller made assessments based on his past experience, knowledge, and perceptions of the performance capabilities of both the Embraer 190 and the Boeing 777, including:- perceiving the Embraer 190 at a speed at or near its rotation speed;- perceiving the Embraer 190 in a position at or beyond a typical rotation point;- timing the Boeing 777s take-off clearance; and- anticipating that the Embraer 190 would be airborne by the time the Boeing 777 flight crew read back their take-off clearance and started the take-off roll.The controllers expectation was very high that the Embraer 190 would depart at the controllers assessed position and time. This expectation was reinforced by his knowledge that:- high-speed rejected takeoffs are rare;- aircraft do not conduct rejected takeoffs after rotation; and- he had never in his career seen a rejected takeoff at such a high speed or from that point on the runway.With this understanding, the monitoring stage and confirmation of action of the Embraer 190s departure was effectively complete. Therefore, the controller transitioned to other duties, even though he did not actually see the Embraer 190 rotate. He concluded that the Embraer 190 was rotating based on all of the cues indicating that his assessment was correct.The point at which the controller decided to issue the take-off clearance to the Boeing 777 was several seconds before the Embraer 190 was anticipated to be airborne. The controllers situation assessment matched his mental model up to the point of the bird strike and the USiT. This decision was also influenced by guidance and procedures in the MATS, as well as the controllers extensive experience.In this case, the controller needed external cues to tell him that things were not as he had assessed. He did not hear any radio calls from the Embraer 190 and did not receive any RIMCAS alerts; therefore, the controller did not receive any contradictory cues (aural or visual) to challenge his mental model or his expectations, or alter his assessment or actions. These 2 defences failed.As a result, the controllers mental model and expectation were that the aircraft was rotating, which meant that it was essentially considered departed and no longer required his attention and monitoring. The controller assessed the situation as typical and familiar and identified a course of action likely to succeed, which allowed him to rapidly move on to other pressing tasks and decisions. This decision is consistent with naturalistic decision making and with the way experts make rapid and timely decisions in a dynamic environment and under time pressure. The controller timed the delivery and expected readback of the Boeing 777s take-off clearance so that the aircraft would start its take-off roll immediately after the Embraer 190 became airborne, satisfying procedural requirements of the MATS.Finding as to causes and contributing factorsGiven the Embraer 190s speed and position on the runway, the controller was not expecting a high-speed rejected takeoff. He assessed that the aircraft was becoming airborne and no longer required his attention and monitoring. As a result, he issued the take-off clearance to the Boeing 777 even though the Embraer 190 was still on the runway.Bird strike and Embraer 190s rejected takeoffWhen the Embraer 190 struck a bird on its take-off roll, the controller was issuing a take-off clearance to the Boeing 777. The Embraer 190 was travelling at 139 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS)just below the calculated V1 speed of 146 KIASat the time. The captain of the Embraer 190 initiated a rejected takeoff and the first officer transmitted a radio call, per company procedures. This whole sequence of events took 5 seconds.Finding as to causes and contributing factorsThe Embraer 190 struck a bird and conducted a rejected takeoff at a critical point during its take-off roll, just before the Boeing 777 received its take-off clearance and started its own take-off roll.Undetected simultaneous transmissionsSimultaneous transmissions are a common hazard in aviation. They pose a threat and the risk of important communications going unheard increases when these transmission signals go undetected.The radio transmissions from the Embraer 190 and the Boeing 777 were initiated within 0.1 seconds of each other and 0.6 and 0.7 seconds, respectively, after the controller had ended his radio transmission for the Boeing 777s take-off clearance:- At 0948:53.4, the first officer of the Embraer 190 initiated the radio call for the rejected takeoff. This transmission lasted 3.13 seconds.- At 0948:53.5, the first officer of the Boeing 777 initiated the readback of the take-off clearance. This transmission lasted 3.225 seconds.The timing of these radio calls indicates a full overlap of radio signals. As a result of this USiT, neither the controller nor the flight crew of the Boeing 777 were aware of the conflict because they did not know that the Embraer 190 was conducting a rejected takeoff.Finding as to causes and contributing factorsThe first officer of the Embraer 190 made a radio call reporting the rejected takeoff, but this call went undetected by the controller or the Boeing 777 flight crew as it was overlapped by the radio call from the first officer of the Boeing 777 reading back the take-off clearance. As a result, neither the controller nor the Boeing 777 flight crew were aware that the Embraer 190 was rejecting the takeoff.Detecting the Embraer 190s rejected takeoffIn this occurrence, the USiT meant that no aural cue was available to alert the controller or the Boeing 777 flight crew to the rejected takeoff. Unaware of the Embraer 190's radio call to reject the takeoff, the controller carried on with his duties.Once the Embraer 190 flight crew initiated the rejected takeoff, some visual cues were available to the controller:- the Embraer 190 could be seen decelerating on the runway; and- the speed values on the track label for the Embraer 190 on the controller working position (CWP) could be seen decreasing.Because the controller was working from the north tower control position, he had to perform visual scans to monitor the thresholds of Runway 05 and Runway 06L, the departure end of Runway 06L, and the monitors at his CWP. To face either Runway 05 and the CWP or Runway 06L, he needed to turn 180°, and did so several times. This made it more difficult to visually monitor aircraft departing from Runway 06L because of the visual obstructions present when he was looking across the tower cab and out the window at Runway 06L.Furthermore, when the controller perceived that the Embraer 190 was about to become airborne, and with no expectation that it would perform a rejected take-off at that point, he concluded that it no longer required his attention and monitoring. He then shifted his body and visual scan, and started focusing on listening to the Boeing 777s clearance readback, monitoring an aircraft landing on Runway 05, instructing an aircraft to line up on Runway 06L, and then looking down at his CWP. Because the controller had already shifted his focus to aircraft arriving on Runway 05, his back was likely turned away and he was no longer looking at the departure end of Runway 06L and, therefore, the Embraer 190 was no longer in his field of view.As for the monitors at this CWP, the track labels are small and it is possible that changes to an aircrafts speed, altitude, or flight status on the track label would go unnoticed by a controller who is standing and concentrating on looking outside to control aircraft movements. In this case, the controller did not notice any changes to the speed of the Embraer 190 once it had rejected the takeoff.Lastly, the RIMCAS was not configured to help the controller detect the conflict that occurred following the rejected takeoff and did not generate alerts (visual or aural) in time.Finding as to causes and contributing factorsBecause the controller was expecting the Embraer 190 to take off without interruption, he shifted his attention and priority to other aircraft movements. Focus on these tasks, combined with operating from the north tower position, reduced the controller's opportunity to detect the Embraer 190s rejected takeoff and delayed the response to the conflict.After the Boeing 777 flight crew had read back their take-off clearance, they began the takeoff roll. At that moment, they were unaware of the bird strike or the Embraer 190s rejected take-off and saw no apparent risk of collision. They could see the Embraer 190 on the runway, but had no reason to expect that it would not be airborne given that they had received their take-off clearance. In addition, because they did not hear the radio call made by the first officer of the Embraer 190, no aural cues were available to alert the Boeing 777 flight crew of the Embraer 190s rejected takeoff.Finding as to causes and contributing factorsThe Boeing 777 flight crew visually sighted the Embraer 190, believed it would soon be airborne, and saw no apparent risk of collision; however, they were unaware that it was conducting a rejected takeoff and decelerating. Proceeding as authorized, the Boeing 777 flight crew commenced their take-off roll while the Embraer 190 was still on the runway, which resulted in a runway incursion and risk of collision.In-air/on-ground flight statusIn this occurrence, 3 aircraft were on the runway at the same time: the Embraer 190, the Boeing 777, and a de Havilland DHC-8 that was moving into position and waiting to take off.Advanced surface movement guidance and control system (A-SMGCS) alerts were generated only after both the Embraer 190 and the Boeing 777 had initiated their respective rejected takeoff procedures. The investigation examined why neither a stage 1 alert  departure nor a stage 2 alert  departure was generated earlier in the occurrence sequence of events. The following sections will discuss the system logic that contributed to the in-air/on-ground flight statuses observed in this occurrence. Honeywell Primus Epic monitor warning functionThe investigation determined that the Honeywell XS-857A Mode S transponders system logic complies with the Minimum Operational Performance Standards for Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System/Mode Select (ATCRBS/Mode S) Airborne Equipment (DO-181 MOPS) guidance and, as designed, uses the in-air/on-ground status that it receives from the Honeywell Primus Epics MWF. Although the MWF system used input from the weight-on-wheels sensors, an examination of where the data came from found that the origin of the inair/on-ground status was the logic in the MWF because the validation check used a speed of 50 knots.The system logic in the Honeywell Primus Epic avionic suite causes the XS-857A Mode S transponder to transmit an in-air status when the indicated airspeed is greater than 50 knots, even if the aircraft is still on the ground. Although the investigation was unable to determine why the MWF was set to 50 knots, the threshold of 50 knots complies with the applicable standard and technical standard orders, was set in accordance with design requirements, and presented no issues for the operation at the time of design and certification processes in the early 2000s. The DO-181 MOPS cites 100 knots as a validation check for overriding a faulty on-ground status and accepts any value below 100 knots (including 50 knots) as valid.Discussions with Honeywell and Embraer revealed that the 50-knot value was selected during the design and certification processes for the Embraer 190. It was most likely selected as a conservative speed value to ensure the timely interoperability of the transponder with airborne surveillance systems (such as an airborne collision avoidance system [ACAS]) before flight while the aircraft accelerates on its take-off roll. At that time (early 2000s), the DO-181 MOPS predated systems such as A-SMGCS and RIMCAS. The use of the transponders in-air status function for use by ground surveillance systems was not considered by the DO-181 MOPS, applicable technical standard orders, aircraft and transponder manufacturers, or other stakeholders. While this speed value complies with the applicable standard and technical standard orders and is an effective means of ensuring the timely interoperability of the transponder with airborne surveillance systems before flight, it provides inaccurate information for ground surveillance systems that need to accurately determine an aircrafts on-ground status.The transponders on board the Embraer 190 and the Boeing 777 functioned as designed and switched to an in-air status after the aircraft had accelerated past a speed threshold during takeoff while still on the ground, making the aircraft visible to ACAS. This is consistent with the original intent of the system.Transport Canada has confirmed that selections of this threshold value vary and are generally selected by the aircraft manufacturer. The selection of a 50-knot override threshold found within the Embraer 190s transponder system logic may be unusually low for large transport-category aircraft, but other aircraft may have different override threshold values below 100 knots as well.Finding as to causes and contributing factorsThe Embraer 190s transponder transmitted that the aircraft was in air after the aircraft accelerated past 50 knots. As a result, although compliant with current standards, an inaccurate in-air status was transmitted for approximately 52 seconds while the aircraft remained on the ground during its take-off roll and rejected takeoff.Runway incursion monitoring and conflict alert sub-system alert logic The RIMCAS is designed to monitor aircraft and vehicles and to identify and alert air traffic controllers to possible conflict situations. In this occurrence it functioned as designed; however, because the transponder transmitted an inaccurate status, the RIMCAS did not immediately detect the departure conflict and, as a result, the controller did not receive an alert until after both aircraft had conducted their rejected takeoffs.To provide timely and accurate alerts, the RIMCAS must correctly identify a targets status. If a target is identified as in air, it will be omitted from the targets used to detect a departure conflict. Therefore, if the RIMCAS receives or uses an inaccurate in-air/on-ground status, it might not identify vehicles or aircraft that are on the ground at critical times.In this occurrence, at 0948:30, 3 seconds after the Embraer 190 accelerated through a ground speed of 50 knots, the A-SMGCS multi-sensor tracker (MST) accepted the aircrafts status based on its ground bit set (GBS) value and inaccurately identified the Embraer 190 as being in air. As a result, the RIMCAS logic omitted the radar target from the departure conflict detection logic. Forty-two seconds later, when the Boeing 777 was accelerating down the runway, the criteria for a stage 2 alert  departure should have been met; however, because the Embraer 190 was still identified as being in air, the RIMCAS did not detect a departure conflict. The Boeing 777 initiated its rejected takeoff 12.5 seconds later.The RIMCAS generated an alert regarding these 2 aircraft at 0949:43, when both the Embraer 190 and the Boeing 777 met the criteria to be identified as on ground.The investigation determined that the RIMCAS relied on the GBS value for automated conflict detection and alerting, despite the limitations with respect to the accuracy of the data. However, the investigation was unable to determine the rationale behind the RIMCAS default values and what the full extent of the repercussions would be if the parameters were modified and the setting of the in-air status at takeoff were delayed.The RIMCAS can be configured to overcome these limitations, but doing so may cause false alarms, which might reduce the controllers confidence in the sub-system.The DO-181 MOPS recommended speed of 100 knots for the transition point from on ground to in air is beneficial to ensure the timely interoperability of an aircrafts transponder with airborne surveillance systems before it becomes airborne. However, data inputs (such as Mode S reply messages, MWF values, or GBS values) that use a speed value may provide inaccurate data for ground surveillance systems or automated runway incursion monitoring systems, such as RIMCAS.This investigation focused heavily on the inaccuracies found in the in-air status of the Embraer 190 and the RIMCAS. The Embraer 190 was identified as in air for approximately 52 seconds even though it remained on the ground. Simulations and an examination of flight data show that the Embraer 190 would have been identified as in air for approximately 19 seconds even if the DO-181 MOPS recommended airspeed of 100 knots had been applied.Equally important, however, is the fact that the Boeing 777s in-air/on-ground status was also inaccurate. The status of the Boeing 777 switched to in air at 0949:20 once it accelerated past 100 knots during its take-off roll, and remained that way for approximately 23 seconds even though the aircraft was still on the ground. Although the investigation did not examine the Boeing 777s avionics systems or its transponder, it did determine that these systems will inaccurately identify an aircraft as in air if 100 knots is used as the standard recommended speed (in compliance with the DO-181 MOPS) and the aircraft is accelerating past that speed but is still on the ground.In this occurrence, ground surveillance systems and automated runway incursion monitoring systems, such as RIMCAS, relied on the accuracy of the GBS value received from aircraft transponders. However, RIMCAS may make use of other available data to determine whether an aircraft is on ground or in air. As this occurrence demonstrated, the aircrafts or transponders on-ground status function data were inaccurateindicating in air when the aircraft was on ground. Using this inaccurate information, the RIMCAS made a determination that the Embraer 190 had become in air for a period of time while it was still on the runway. This same RIMCAS behaviour resulted in the controllers display indicating the Boeing 777 was in air for 23 seconds even though it also remained on the runway during the entire occurrence. If more accurate aircraft status data are available, these systems will be better able to determine an aircrafts on-ground status and provide accurate and timely alerts.Finding as to causes and contributing factorsThe RIMCAS relies on data from aircraft systems designed to provide aircraft flight status data for use by airborne surveillance systems. The use of this data by RIMCAS led to the inaccurate identification of the Embraer 190 and the Boeing 777 as in air while these 2 aircraft were still on the ground. This resulted in late and inaccurate RIMCAS alerts and delayed the response to the risk of collision.In addition to the inaccuracies identified above, the RIMCAS was also subject to internal latencies. As the Embraer 190s airspeed was decelerating through 50 knots, its GBS from the multilateration system changed from in air to on ground. However, the MST delayed changing the targets flight status for a further 6 seconds. This delay was also observed during the Boeing 777s deceleration as the MST also delayed changing the Boeing 777s flight status to on ground for 11 seconds. The cause of these delays in the changes to the aircraft flight status back to on ground was due to the setting of the Ground speed parameter within the RIMCAS, which was set 10 knots lower than the take-off speed, or the Minimum speed for takeoff when GBS is OK, of 50 knots. These values are set as recommended by Indra Navia AS after a local tuning and optimization process is completed with the client.Finding as to riskIf the logic which determines flight status within the RIMCAS has a latency of several seconds, the resulting delays in conflict detection increase the risk that the RIMCAS alerts will be ineffective.Boeing 777s rejected takeoffWhen the Boeing 777 flight crew detected that the Embraer 190 had rejected its takeoff and was decelerating on the active runway, they rejected their takeoff and significantly reduced the severity of this runway incursion. The Boeing 777 reached 133 KIAS before decelerating. At that point, the Boeing 777 and the Embraer 190 were separated by 5000 feet and that distance was decreasing.The defences that were present included technical safety barriers (such as the use of radios and the interoperability between transponders and RIMCAS) and procedural safety barriers (such as aerodrome operating procedures, air traffic control procedures, and airline or pilot operating procedures).A number of these defences broke down after the bird strike, the Embraer 190s rejected takeoff, and the USiT, but 1 line of defence remained in place: the visual separation maintained by the Boeing 777 flight crew. The risk of collision was mitigated when the Boeing 777 flight crew conducted its own rejected takeoff.Finding as to causes and contributing factorsA risk of collision occurred when the accelerating Boeing 777 was travelling at 133 KIAS and was approximately 5000 feet from the decelerating Embraer 190. The risk was mitigated once the Boeing 777 flight crew rejected their takeoff after recognizing that the Embraer 190 was still on the runway ahead of them. 
A China Southern Airlines Airbus A319-100, registration B-6200 performing flight CZ-3488 from Lijang to Guangzhou (China), was accelerating for takeoff from Lijang when a loud bang occurred and the crew rejected takeoff due to an engine (CFM56) failure. The aircraft slowed safely.Chinese Media reported some parts fell off the aircraft.A replacement A319-100 registration B-6408 was dispatched to Lijang and reached Guangzhou with a delay of about 7 hours.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground (standing 14.6. 18:00Z) about 128 hours (5 days and 8 hours) after the rejected takeoff.
A Condor Boeing 757-300, registration D-ABOJ performing flight DE-1034 from Nuremberg (Germany) to Palma Mallorca,SP (Spain), was accelerating for takeoff from Nuremberg's runway 28 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 115 knots over ground) due to an engine (RB211) excess exhaust gas temperature indication. The aircraft slowed safely, vacated the runway and returned to the apron. Emergency services needed to cool the brakes with fans.The aircraft remained on the ground for about 25 hours, then positioned to Frankfurt/Main (Germany), remained in Frankfurt for another 36 hours before returning to service.
A Jetstar Asia Airbus A320-200, registration 9V-JSU performing flight 3K-205 from Singapore (Singapore) to Jakarta (Indonesia) with 15 people on board, was performing a rolling takeoff from Singapore Changi Airport's runway 20L at 20:11L (12:11Z) when the crew noticed that the runway center line lights were off and believed the runway edge lights were on thought more faint than usual. The crew commenced takeoff, were unsure whether the runway end lights were illuminated, upon rotation the crew noticed the runway edge lights had gone off. Climbing out the crew reported to tower, who then switched all runway lights on.Singapore's TSIB released their final report (erroneously identifying 9V-JSM as occurrence aircraft, which performed a flight to Manila about 10 hours later but didn't move at the occurrence time at all) concluding the probable causes of the takeoff incident were:- Controllers had to judge the hours of darkness to decide when to switch ON the airfield lighting for night operations. This method is subjective.- When RWC3 (Runway Controller 3) looked out of the tower windows to check if the runway edge lights and runway centreline lights were ON, it is likely that due to expectation bias, she did not notice that the runway lights were OFF.- RWC3 also looked at the A-SMGCS display to check if the runway lights were ON. However, the graphical presentation of the A-SMGCS display appeared quite cluttered and she did not discern that the runway lights were OFF.- It is likely that due to expectation bias, the flight crew presumed that the runway edge lights and runway end lights were ON and thus they proceeded with the take-off, on the grounds that such a runway light configuration met the operators SOP requirement for a night take-off.- The FO did not share with the PIC his thoughts about querying ATC on the absence of the runway centreline lights. This suggests that the crew resource management performance was not optimum.- During the introduction of a new type of edge lights for Runway 3, the ANSP did not consider whether such runway edge lights could be seen, or could be easily seen, by controllers at CET (Changi East Tower).- Not all controllers were aware that the ANSP has an in-house hazard reporting system. The captain (42, ATPL, 12,193 hours total, 11,964 hours on type) was pilot flying, the first officer (50, ATPL, 6,706 hours total, 4,298 hours on type) was pilot monitoring.The TSIB analysed:Querying ATC about abnormal runway lighting configurationAccording to the flight crew, Runway 3s edge lights were ON when they were entering the runway and remained ON until shortly after the aircraft had lifted off from the runway. They could not recall whether they looked in the direction of the runway end lights and hence were not sure of the status of the runway end lights. The CCTV footage and record of the airfield lighting system obtained by the investigation team clearly showed that they were mistaken, as Runway 3s edge lights, centreline lights and end lights had not yet been switched ON by RWC3 at CET at the time of the incident.The operators SOP allows take-off without runway centreline lights, provided that both the runway end lights and runway edge lights are ON. The flight crew did not ensure this condition was satisfied before initiating the take-off roll. 2.1.1.3 The flight crew are based in Singapore and familiar with Changi Airport. Such flight crew are expected to regard it as unusual to see Changi Airport operate with the runway centreline lights OFF at night. Even if the runway light configuration meets the operators take-off requirement (i.e. runway edge lights ON and runway end lights ON), it would be prudent for such flight crew to query ATC about the absence of the runway centreline lights.Crew resource managementThe flight crew had noticed that Runway 3s centreline lights were OFF. According to the FO, he did have the thought to suggest to the PIC to query ATC about the absence of the runway centreline lights, but he put off the idea and waited instead to see what the PIC was going to do. This suggests that the flight crews crew resource management performance was not optimum.The FO indicated to the investigation team that, in hindsight, he should have been more proactive to share his thoughts with and make suggestions to the PIC instead of waiting to see what the PIC was going to do.Expectation bias on the part of the flight crew and RWC3The investigation team detected several instances of expectation bias12 in this incident, as follow:- Runway 3s end lights were OFF, but the flight crew could not recall whether they looked in the direction of the runway end lights and hence could not be sure whether the runway end lights were ON. During the night trial mentioned in paragraph 1.10, the runway end lights could be clearly seen from Runway 20Ls threshold when they were switched ON. Had the flight crew consciously checked for the status of the runway end lights, they would have noticed that the runway end lights were OFF and this could have prompted them to query ATC regarding the status of the runway lights. The flight crew probably had expected the runway end lights to be ON and thus did not positively look out for it.- Runway 3s edge lights were OFF, but the flight crew somehow noted that they were ON. As mentioned in paragraph 1.10.5, it was unlikely that Runway 3s edge lights could appear ON when they were in fact OFF, and also unlikely that other lights could be misidentified or mistaken as the runway edge lights. However, given the numerous taxiway edge lights around the threshold of Runway 20L, the flight crew may have experienced confirmation bias in perceiving the taxiway edge lights as runway edge lights while turning onto the runway, even though they are of different colours. The flight crew did not positively check for the status of the runway edge lights.- Runway 3s edge lights and centreline lights are bi-directional. When switched ON, it is doubtful if controllers can see the runway edge lights and runway centreline lights within about 500m along the runway on either side of CET (see Figure 5). While the edge lights beyond this section of the runway might be seen by controllers at CET, they are not easily discernible. When switched OFF, none of these lights could of course be seen. However, RWC3 did not detect anything unusual when she looked out of the tower windows to check the runway edge lights and runway centreline lights13. RWC3 probably had expected the runway lights to be ON and the quick glance at the A-SMGCS could not clearly indicate the status of these lights. Given the bi-directional nature of Runway 3s edge lights and runway centreline lights, the view of the centre portion of Runway 3 is similar at night whether the runway lights are ON or not. As CET had just been in operation for a few months, controllers might not have realised this similarity. It is desirable that the ANSP highlights such similarity to controllers and develops methods to enable controllers to positively identify the status of the runway lights.Because of expectation bias, opportunities for the flight crew and RWC3 to notice the unusual configuration of the runway lights were missed. To mitigate the effect of expectation bias, it cannot be overemphasised that operational personnel should be vigilant and make conscious efforts to positively check things out when performing their tasks.Runway lighting controlSOP for switching ON runway lights for night operationsRunway lights are required to be ON during hours of darkness. At the time of the incident, controllers had to make a judgment as to when to switch ON the runway lights.The investigation team finds that controllers judgment of the hours of darkness could be very subjective for deciding when to switch ON the airfield lighting for night operations. This can result in the airfield lighting in different areas of responsibility being switched ON at different times of the day. A more objective approach to controlling the airfield lighting for night operations should be considered. For example, an alert (aural and/or visual) could be set to remind controllers to switch ON the airfield lighting at a pre-determined time at or near sunset time.A-SMGCS display of ON/OFF status of runway lightsAccording to the ANSP, the A-SMGCS provides controllers with an accurate representation of the ON/OFF status of runway lights. However, the investigation team found that the graphical presentation of the A-SMGCS appeared quite cluttered and that it was not easy to discern whether the runway lights are ON or OFF just by a quick glance at the A-SMGCS display. It seems desirable for the graphical presentation of the ON/OFF status of the runway lights to be enhanced.Organisational factorsRisk assessment on the use of Runways 3 edge lightsAlthough Runway 3s lighting system complied with international standards, the risk assessment of the runway lighting system apparently did not consider the differences in the views of Runway 3s edge lights and of the edge lights installed along Runway 1 and Runway 2. As a result, the risk assessment did not consider whether the Runway 3s edge lights could be seen, or could be easily seen, by controllers at CET, and nor establishing a method for controllers to visually verify the status of the runway lights.In-house hazard reporting system of the ANSPThe ANSP has a hazard reporting system for controllers to report hazards. However, apparently not all its controllers were aware of this system.While the ANSP promotes systematically its hazard reporting system to controllers, it appeared that the promotional effort had not been effective in making all its controllers aware of the hazard reporting system.View in night conditions on the runway with all runway lights off (Photo: TSIB):
A Republic Airways Embraer ERJ-175 on behalf of American Airlines, registration N401YX performing flight AA-4837 from Indianapolis,IN to Chicago O'Hare,IL (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Indianapolis's runway 05L when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 35 knots over ground) reporting smoke in the cabin. The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway.A replacement Embraer ERJ-175 registration N136HQ reached Chicago with a delay of 2:15 hours.The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground for about 24 hours, then attempted another flight but needed to return to the gate from the hold short and remained on the ground until Jun 6th 2022.The FAA reported: "AIRCRAFT ABORTED TAKEOFF DUE TO SMOKE IN THE COCKPIT, TAXIED OFF RUNWAY AND EVACUATED THE PLANE VIA CHUTES, INDIANAPOLIS, IN.", one passenger received a minor injury, the damage to the aircraft was unknown.
A VivaAerobus Airbus A321-200N, registration XA-VBZ performing flight VB-1281 from Villahermosa to Mexico City (Mexico), was accelerating for takeoff from Villahermosa's runway 08 when the left hand engine (PW1133G) ingested a bird and received damage. The crew continued takeoff, climbed the aircraft to 2000 feet and returned to Villahermosa for a safe landing on runway 08 about 15 minutes after departure.A replacement Airbus A320-200 registration XA-VAV reached Mexico City with a delay of 6:40 hours.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Villahermosa about 24 hours after landing back.On Jun 3rd 2022 Mexico's AIB reported the aircraft received a bird strike to its left fuselage about 0.5nm past the airport, the bird was subsequently ingested by the left hand engine resulting in an engine fire. There were no injuries, the aircraft sustained minor damage. The occurrence was rated a serious incident and is being investigated by Mexico's AIB.
An Indigo Airbus A320-200N, registration VT-ISV performing flight 6E-246 from Bangalore to Bhubaneswar (India), was cleared for takeoff from Bangalore's runway 09L and departed. An Indigo Airbus A320-200N, registration VT-ITD performing flight 6E-455 from Bangalore to Kolkata (India), was cleared for takeoff from runway 09R and departed at the same time.The separation between the two aircraft was lost after departure.On May 30th 2022 India's DGCA reported that 6E-455 had been cleared for takeoff from the southern runway after south tower had properly coordinated with approach control. 6E-246 was cleared for takeoff by north tower, however without coordination with approach or south tower. The aircraft were on a converging heading, which approach control resolved by sending the aircraft onto diverging headings. The minimum separation was 100 feet vertical and 0.9nm horizontal (runways are just over 1.0nm apart). The north tower controller was dismissed, the occurrence was rated a serious incident and is being investigated by India's AIB.Metars:VOBL 070500Z 15005KT 110V190 3000 BR SCT008 22/18 Q1020 BECMG 4000 BR=VOBL 070430Z 12006KT 3000 BR SCT008 21/18 Q1020 BECMG 4000 BR=VOBL 070417Z 13005KT 080V160 3000 BR SCT008 21/18 Q1020 BECMG 4000 BR=VOBL 070400Z 14006KT 2000 BR BKN006 20/19 Q1020 BECMG 3000 BR=VOBL 070330Z 13008KT 2000 BR BKN006 19/19 Q1020 BECMG 3000 BR=VOBL 070300Z 12005KT 080V140 2000 BR BKN006 19/18 Q1020 BECMG 3000 BR=VOBL 070230Z 11005KT 1000 R09R/2000 BR BKN004 18/18 Q1019 BECMG 2000 BR=VOBL 070200Z 12005KT 1000 R09R/2000 BR BKN004 18/18 Q1019 BECMG 2000 BR=VOBL 070130Z 12005KT 1000 R09R/2000 BR BKN004 17/17 Q1018 TEMPO 0800 FG=VOBL 070100Z 12005KT 1000 R09R/2000 BR BKN004 17/17 Q1018 TEMPO 0800 FG=VOBL 070030Z 16005KT 1500 BR R09R/2000 BKN005 18/18 Q1018 TEMPO 0800 FG BKN004=VOBL 070000Z 14006KT 1500 BR R09R/2000 BKN005 18/18 Q1017 TEMPO 0800 FG BKN004=
A LATAM Airbus A321-200, registration PT-MXA performing flight LA-3864 from Fortaleza,CE to Rio de Janeiro,RJ (Brazil), was accelerating for takeoff from Fortaleza's runway 13 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 95 knots over ground) due to an engine (V2533) failure. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.A replacement Airbus A321-200 registration PT-XPG reached Rio de Janeiro with a delay of 6.5 hours.The occurrence aircraft returned to service about 17 hours after the rejected takeoff.
An Air Sanga de Havilland DHC-6-300, registration P2-ASM performing a flight from Wobagen to Bak (Papua New Guinea) with 7 passengers and 2 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Wobagen's runway 12 when the aircraft began to veer right off the runway prompting the crew to reject takeoff. The aircraft went over a drain, the nose gear collapsed and came to a stop at approx. position S5.2739 E142.0326. One passenger received minor injuries. The aircraft sustained substantial damage to the nose gear, the cockpit forward bulkhead, left propeller and left wing.Papua New Guinea's AIC reported: "Information provided to the AIC indicates that as a result of the occurrence, a child resulted injured and the aircraft sustained damage. The child was later airlifted to a hospital in Kiunga to receive medical attention." The AIC was informed the same day and opened an investigation.On Dec 30th 2020 PNG's AIC released their preliminary report reporting the aircraft was flown by the captain (48, ATPL, 6,748 hours total, 1,450 hours on type) sa pilot flying and first officer (51, ATPL, 14,856 hours total, 9,550 hours on type) as pilot monitoring. The AIC summarized the sequence of events:Data obtained from the aircraft recording systems showed that the crew completed the Before Take-off checklist at the parking area and then began taxiing west towards the threshold of strip 12.At about 09:13, upon reaching the threshold of strip 12, the PIC conducted a 180° turn and applied maximum power, transitioning from taxi into take-off roll.During an interview with the AIC, the crew stated that after applying maximum power, the aircraft had a tendency to veer to the right. The PIC tried to maintain the aircraft on centreline by using asymmetric thrust, however, as the aircraft accelerated down the strip, the tendency to veer right increased. About 154m down the strip, the aircraft began veering towards the right and tracked away from the centreline (see Figure 2). As the aircraft passed the strip boundary (cone markers), with a recorded groundspeed of 40kt the crew aborted the take-off; power to idle and applied full brakes. The aircraft continued forward and veering right. Four seconds later, the aircraft impacted a drain.The nosewheel subsequently separated from the fork causing the nose to drop and the nose gear subsequently collapsed. The momentum of the aircraft caused it to continue another 8m with the nose dragging across the ground before it impacted the right edge drain.The crew stated during interview that after the aircraft came to rest, the flight crew carried out the procedure for shutting the engines down. In the meantime, the passengers opened the door of the cabin and exited the aircraft. Both pilots exited through their respective doors. One passenger reported to have suffered minor injuries.In May 2022 the AIC released their final report concluding the probable causes of the accident were:The crew did not action the appropriate take-off checklist which caused them to miss crucial checks and actions. This caused the engine abnormalities to go unnoticed after take-off power was applied. The abnormal parameters engine parameters remained unnoticed until impact. The parameters of right engine indicate that it was performing at considerably lower power than the left engine, which was operating to the manufacturers specifications. The power difference between the right and left engine created the tendency of the aircraft to veer right. The right engine T5 Turbine temperature exceeded the limit which shows that the overtemperature condition was sustained by the right engine.The wet deteriorated clay/silt surface did not allow aircrafts tires to gain sufficient traction to follow the control inputs of the PIC as he attempted to steer the aircraft back towards the centreline. As the aircraft accelerated towards the right, it ran over undulated surface. The aircraft continued veering right because the power was not reduced, and the asymmetric effect continued. With the asymmetric thrust, the undulated slippery surface, the aircraft swerved right. This prompted the PIC to pull power into idle and apply full brakes. After pulling power to idle, and applying full brakes, the aircraft continued with momentum over the significantly slippery surface and impacted the drainage ditch at the edge.The AIC analysed:AIC determined from the available evidence that there was asymmetric thrust sustained during the take-off roll immediately following take-off power selection. There was a significant variation between engine parameter readings of the left and right engine. It was apparent that neither crew member noticed the variations, including the right engine exceedance of the intake turbine temperature limits for after selecting take-off power until the time the accident occurred.During the PICs interview, he confirmed that the aircraft was deviating right of his intended take-off track, against his steering and control inputs. However, he was not able to identify what was causing this deviation. Furthermore, the copilot, during his interview, could not explain what had caused the uncommanded deviation. He confirmed that he was looking outside during the take-off roll.The investigation determined that the procedure used by the crew for take-off was an unapproved and undocumented procedure. The crew did action the procedure according to the Appereo data, however, the procedure did not include certain key considerations and from the standard approved Aircraft Flight Manual. The requirement for the crew to observe engine parameters when applying power for take-off, was the appropriate steps should have been taken. The crew, especially the PIC, would not have been able to carry out this observation effectively as their procedure is meant to transition directly from taxi to the takeoff roll. The investigation determined that the PICs advancement of the throttles was relatively rapid and the engine parameters abruptly increased.Although the Manufacturers AFM Take-Off procedure contains a warning requiring that all take-offs be conducted with full take-off power, the Crew custom procedure did not incorporate a check for power correspondence. The AFM further adds that a 5 s delay is mandatory at 85% Ng for engine parameters to settle before take-off power can be applied. The crew did not conduct this step to ensure power must be present for take-off and also the crew customized procedure did not include this requirement. The crew must check that full take-off power has been achieved by delaying to allow engine parameters to settle was not catered for as the crew had planned to begin the take-off, transitioning directly from taxi. The right engines exceedance of the T5 temperature limits could not be determined as the engine was not recovered and inaccessible. However, the AIC considered that actions contrary to those specified in the AFM Take-Off procedure can be considered a probable factor to the abnormal parameters sustained by the right engine.Asymmetric thrustThe AIC, through the Appareo 1000 video data, observed a disparity between the Propeller RPM gauges for both left and right engine. The left propeller RPM, during the take-off roll was about 5 to as high as 10% higher than the right propeller RPM. This indicates that there was asymmetric thrust sustained during the take-off roll causing a righthand veering tendency. The AIC believes that the asymmetric thrust sustained would not be manageable over normal paved or dry surface conditions. However, because the aircraft was accelerating down a wet slippery clay/silt surface, the maneuverability was reduced significantly. Furthermore, as the aircraft diverged further from the center path, it signified that there was thrust asymmetry, which is likely to have contributed to the aircrafts tendency to veer right. The video also shows that the thrust asymmetry was not corrected in time to maintain the aircrafts intended center path.Because the aircraft had veered off the hardened surface around the narrow center take-off path onto the wet and slippery clay/silt surface right of the centre path of the airstrip, the maneuverability was significantly reduced. The momentum of the aircraft and the lack of traction of due to the slippery surface caused the aircraft to continue past the boundary markers and into the drainage ditch.The pilot records showed that the crew had significant experience operating into airstrips. The crew confirmed that they had operated on airstrips with similar conditions many times using the taxi turn transition technique. The video data shows that they had briefed on the procedure prior to take-off. As this was a take-off the PIC kept his eyes outside as is the appropriate practice. However, the monitoring pilot was also looking outside and did not notice the RPM.The investigation parameters were for the engines reflected the engine control settings by the PIC. It was therefore deduced that the thrust asymmetry was due to thrust lever positions set by the PIC.From the time between the take-off and accident, the AIC believes, the PIC did not have sufficient time to identify the cause of the aircrafts tendency to veer towards the right.Airstrip ConditionsThe investigation identified certain obvious hazards during its visit to the accident site. During interview with the crew, the investigators also understood that the crew were aware of some of those significant hazards, and through experience, took certain steps to mitigate the associated risks.Due to unpredictable weather conditions at Wobagen Airstrip, the important weather and airstrip condition information from source at Wabogen was vital. However, that information was not gathered on the day of the accident. The investigation also identified that having a reliable source at each strip providing reliable information would be beneficial to the crew, to fully aware them of risks at a particular strip and how to mitigate those risks.Hazard IdentificationAlthough not directly causal to the accident, the AIC found that a risk assessment was not carried out at Wabogen Airstrip before operating there. According to the investigation, the last flight into Wabogen was a month prior to the accident so conditions of the strip was unknown at the time of the occurrence.Although the Operator had established Hazard Identification and Risk Management procedures in its SMS Manual, the operator did not identify hazards at Wobagen Airstrip and associated risks to properly develop special or specific procedures for Wabogen Airstrip according to the data gathered from the risk assessment. This would have ensured the crew were trained in these special procedures to avoid accidentTake-off techniqueThe take-off procedure described by the crew could not be found in the aircraft manufacturer flight manual or other operational manuals. The crew also confirmed that they did not have the procedure documented. However, they trained and permitted PNG airstrip experienced pilots to conduct this procedure.Understanding the challenges posed by airstrips in Papua New Guinea, and the number of unconventional techniques that pilots operating into those airstrips use to allow services, it is still important to develop procedure and/ or deviations from procedures and submit to the appropriate authorities any deviation from standard operating procedures from approved procedure developed or procedures must be by Operators for only used by highly experienced pilots. They confirmed that they also did not have a written procedure for the take-off procedure.The aircraft seen after the runway excursion (Photo: PNG AIC):Damage to nose bulkhead and nose gear (Photo: PNG AIC):Damage to left wing root (Graphics: PNG AIC):The ground track of the aircraft (Graphics: PNG AIC):Map (Graphics: AVH/Bing Maps):

A Spicejet de Havilland Dash 8-400, registration VT-SUG performing flight SG-2871 from Mumbai to Kishangarh (India), was accelerating for takeoff from Mumbai's runway 27 when the crew rejected takeoff due to the stall of the right hand engine (PW150A). The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The aircraft was able to depart later and reached Kishangarh with a delay of 3:10 hours.
A United Nigeria Airlines Embraer ERJ-145, registration 5N-BWW performing flight NUA-505 from Abuja to Lagos (Nigeria) with 43 passengers and 4 crew, was lining up for departure from runway 22 when the crew received a "E1 OIL IMP BYP" advisory. The aircraft commenced takeoff and was climbing out of Abuja's runway 22 when a loud bang came from the rear of the aircraft, all engine parameters showed green. At about 4000 feet another loud bang was heard from the back and the engine instruments indicated the left engine had flamed out. The crew requested a direct return to runway 04 at Abuja. The aircraft landed safely on runway 04 about 14 minutes after departure.On Apr 26th 2022 Nigerai's AIB released their preliminary report rating the occurrence a serious incident. There were no injuries, there also was no damage to the aircraft. The flight data recorder did not record this flight, the last recording on the FDR had been on Feb 14th 2021. 
An Eurowings Airbus A320-200, registration D-AEWV performing flight EW-9763 from Zurich (Switzerland) to Dusseldorf (Germany), was accelerating for takeoff from runway 28, when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (120 knots over ground) due to a bird strike into the left hand engine (CFM56). The aircraft slowed safely and came to a stop short of the intersection of runway 28 with runway 16. Emergency services responded and checked the aircraft, which subsequently taxied to the apron.The aircraft remained on the ground for about 34 hours, then positioned to Dusseldorf.
A Malta Air Boeing 737-800 on behalf of Ryanair, registration 9H-QDX performing flight FR-3010 from Liverpool,EN (UK) to Rome Fiumicino (Italy), was accelerating for takeoff from Liverpool's runway 27 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed due to strong vibrations of the airframe. The aircraft came to a stop about 550 meters short of the runway end.Passengers reported an "almighty shudder". Some fellow passengers stated they saw a bird being ingested by one of the engines. Initially the crew suspected a tyre had burst on departure, later they were told a bird had been ingested by one of the engines (CFM56).The airport reported the aircraft rejected takeoff after a suspected bird strike.A replacement Ryanair Boeing 737-800 registration EI-DCP reached Rome with a delay of 5.5 hours.The occurrence aircraft returned to service about 20 hours after the rejected takeoff.
A LOT Polish Airlines Embraer ERJ-195, registration SP-LND performing flight LO-420 from Zurich (Switzerland) to Warsaw (Poland), was accelerating for takeoff from Zurich's runway 28 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 90 knots over ground) due to a bird strike. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.Following examination by maintenance the aircraft was able to depart about 2:30 hours after the rejected takeoff and reached Warsaw with a delay of 2:40 hours.
A KLM Boeing 777-300, registration PH-BVK performing flight KL-590 from Accra (Ghana) to Amsterdam (Netherlands), was accelerating for takeoff from Accra's runway 03 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 145 knots over ground) due to a bird strike at about 22:39L (22:39Z). The aircraft slowed safely, vacated the runway at the end and became disabled on the parallel taxiway due to a number of tyres deflating. The aircraft was towed to the apron about 30 minutes after becoming disabled on the taxiway.The airport reported the aircraft rejected takeoff from runway 21 due to a bird strike near the windshield. The aircraft was subsequently towed to the apron. The passengers disembarked and were taken to various hotels.ADS-B data transmitted by the transponder of the aircraft make clear the aircraft was accelerating for takeoff from runway 03 and rejected takeoff at about 145 knots over ground.Passengers reported they were told one of the engines (GE90) ingested a bird prompting the takeoff to be rejected. The right hand main tyres deflated during taxiing back to the apron. Ghana's AIB have opened an investigation into the occurrence.The aircraft remained on the ground in Accra for about 27:15 hours, then departed as flight KL-590D and reached Amsterdam with a delay of 27.5 hours about 2 hours after the regular flight KL-590 of Sep 4th 2021 (performed by PH-BVA).On Dec 21st 2021 the Dutch Onderzoeksrrad/Safety Board (DSB) reported the aircraft rejected takeoff as result of a bird strike, two tyres were punctured, two more tyres deflated due to wear. The DSB provided assistance to Ghana's AIB.Ghana's AIB released their final report concluding the probable causes of the incident were:The causal factors include:1. The loud impact noise of the bird strike.2. The uncertainty about the aircrafts ability to fly safely.The contributing factors include:1. Season.2. The time of the flight.3. Nocturnal feeding habits of the bird.The AIB analysed:During the take-off roll of flight KL 590 on the 3rd of September 2021, the crew heard a loud impact noise due to a bird strike and initiated an RTO as a result of the Captains uncertainty of the aircrafts safety for flight. Bird remains cleaned by the KLM Maintenance engineers from the area underneath the Captains number 2 window is proof that the subject aircraft was struck by a bird(s).This is confirmed by the bird remains picked up from the runway after the RTO and the Captains report of the observation of birds before the incident occurred. ...It is evident that the African Wattled Lapwing (Vanellus Senegallus) was involved in the incident. The Lapwing is widespread in sub-Saharan Africa and commonly feeds at night. Records also indicate that the bird remains found after the incident on the runway were that of the African Wattled Lapwing. These birds are resident while breeding, but might move over distances during the rainy season.
A Sunstate Aviation de Havilland Dash 8-400 on behalf of Qantas, registration VH-QOY performing flight QF-2213 from Sydney,NS to Albury,NS (Australia), was climbing out of Sydney when the crew working the after takeoff checklist did not retract the landing gear. Only later in the flight while enroute at FL240 the crew discovered the gear was still down, verified it was safe to retract the landing gear and decided to return to Sydney for a safe landing about one hour after departure.The aircraft remained on the ground in Sydney for about 16.5 hours before returning to service.Australia's ATSB opened a short investigation rating the occurrence an incident.The ATSB released their final report concluding the probable causes of the incident were:Contributing factors- After take-off, the flight crews attention was heavily focused on maintaining the aircraft's speed and pitch, resulting in the omission of the positive rate call. This removed a trigger for the gear up call, which neither pilot identified, and subsequently the landing gear was not retracted after take-off.- Although the landing gear handle was in the down position and 3 green lights were illuminated, the pilot flying incorrectly called 'up, no lights' when conducting the after-take-off checklist. The pilot monitoring did not identify the error. It is likely that both pilots had a strong expectancy that the landing gear had been retracted after take-off when completing the checklist.Other findings- The cabin crew observed that the landing gear remained extended longer than normal following take-off. They advised the flight crew, resulting in the landing gear being retracted.The ATSB analysed:Landing gear not retracted after take-offAfter taking off from Sydney, the flight crew did not raise the landing gear. Ultimately the problem was not identified until the aircraft had reached 15,000 ft. No landing gear speed limits were exceeded. Although the 15,000 ft maximum altitude for operating with the landing gear extended was exceeded, this had no subsequent effect on the serviceability of the aircraft. Nevertheless, the occurrence was of some concern as the flight crew did not identify the incorrect configuration for an extended period of time.Conducting a take-off is a specialised task that is acquired through comprehensive training and significant experience; it involves conducting routine, frequently-practiced tasks in a largely automatic manner with occasional conscious checks on performance. Errors, known as slips and lapses, will occasionally occur when conducting such skill-based tasks (Reason 1990). Omitting a step or an action is one of the most common forms of error (Reason 2002), and they are often associated with interruptions, distractions or attention being diverted to other tasks. Accordingly, occurrences where flight crew forget to raise the landing gear after take-off almost always involve some form of distraction or diverted attention.In this case, both pilots were heavily focused on the aircrafts speed soon during the initial climb. Additionally, the captain was focused on the aircrafts pitch attitude, having previously observed other pilots pitch higher than the operators procedures stated in similar situations, and the workload of the first officer (FO) was increased while hand flying the aircraft.The confirmation of positive rate and subsequent call was a frequently-practiced action for the crew and therefore one normally conducted automatically, with little conscious oversight. Their diverted focus of attention was probably sufficient to result in the omission of the positive-rate call and neither pilot identifying that it had not been made.Not calling positive rate removed the standard verbal cue for the FO to call gear up, increasing the likelihood that the gear-up call would not be made. At this time, both pilots were still focused on aircraft performance but also shifting their focus to the increasing workload of the standard instrument departure.Misidentification of landing gear statusErrors of omission are often difficult to detect by the people who make them (Sarter and Harrison 2000), and the absence of something (such as an action) is harder to detect than the presence of something (Wickens and others 2013). Trying to recall from memory whether actions have already been completed is also vulnerable to source memory confusion, such that the current situation is confused with the memory of many previous occasions when the action was successfully done (Dismukes and others 2007). Accordingly checklists, like the challenge and response after-take-off checklist, perform a vital role in ensuring omissions in a flight crews procedural flow are captured (Barshi and others 2016).When actioning the after-take-off checklist on this occasion, the landing gear item was called by the captain (as pilot monitoring) but neither pilot identified the problem. The captain observed that the 3 green landing gear lights were illuminated, but did not identify it as being problematic for that stage of flight. Although the FO could not recall what they saw at that stage, they also recalled seeing the 3 green lights later in the flight and not thinking it was problematic.Expectations strongly influence where a person will search for information and what they will search for (Wickens and McCarley 2008), and they also influence the perception of information (Wickens and others 2013). Pilots frequently conduct the task of raising the landing gear and, in almost all cases, it is done successfully. Consequently, the pilots on this occasion had a strong expectancy that the landing gear had been retracted, and they probably conducted the after-takeoff checklist with a high degree of automaticity, rather than consciously looking for what was required (that is, no green lights). Although the 3 green lights provided a clearly visible indication that the landing gear was still down, green lights are often associated with something being in a safe state; therefore this cue can be interpreted incorrectly in this phase of flight if the flight crews attention is not focussed on exactly what they are looking for.This type of occurrence is very rare but, when it occurs, a flight crews further troubleshooting of symptoms associated with the landing gear still being down is often not effective. In this case, both pilots reported observing noise and vibration from the aircraft. After some discussion, the crew associated the noise and vibration with the propeller balance maintenance log entry. In an effort to reduce the noise and vibration, the crew reduced the climb speed. This reduced the abnormal indications and seemingly confirmed that the propeller balance was the source of the problem, consistent with the effects of confirmation bias.Awareness displayed by cabin crew The cabin crew displayed a high level of vigilance regarding the aircraft state. Their willingness to bring this to the attention of the flight crew allowed the flight crew to identify the problem and retract the landing gear as soon as possible and highlights the strength of timely communications between crew members.Reduced flying activitySkill decay or skill degradation refers to the loss of trained or acquired skills or knowledge following periods of non-use (Arthur and others 1998). Skill decay increases as the retention interval (or time since learning) increases, and it also increases depending on the quantity and quality of the initial and recurrent training and the amount of on-the-job exposure (Arthur and others 1998, Sanli and others 2018, Vlasblom and others 2020).Procedural skills involving the retrieval and application of step-by-step actions are more sensitive to skill decay than many other types of activities (Goodwin 2006, Stothard and Nicholson 2001, Wisher and others 1999). As recently noted by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA 2021):Procedural tasks that require specific procedural or declarative knowledge (e.g. checklists that require more items than prescribed on paper) may be more susceptible to skill decay than higher order cognitive tasks (e.g. decision making) or perceptual/psychomotor tasks. Cognitive shortcuts for procedures decay rapidly, requiring a significant increase in cognitive resources, in particular for procedures that are normally routine. By their prescriptive nature, procedures are easily subject to slips and lapses. Procedures must be viewed as highly sensitive to proficiency decay.In this case, the FO had undertaken less than the operators normal amount of flying since March 2020. In particular, the FO had conducted less than one third of their normal amount of flying in the previous 90 days and had not conducted any flights for 11 days. However, the operator was aware of the potential issues associated with reduced flight recency and had introduced measures to mitigate the risk. Both flight crew had recently undertaken a proficiency check. Overall, there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the FOs reduced flight recency contributed to the procedural errors made by the flight crew on this occasion.
A Meraj Airlines Airbus A300-600, registration EP-SIG performing flight IJ-4805 from Tehran Imam Khomeini (Iran) to Istanbul (Turkey) with 260 passengers and 12 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Imam Khomeini's runway 29R at about 13:10L (07:40Z) when the crew received a fault indication for the brakes and rejected takeoff at low speed, the aircraft veered left off the left side of the runway before coming to a stop with the left main gear on soft ground.The runway needed to be closed for about 2 hours.The aircraft was able to depart for the flight about 13.5 hours later.Imam Khomeini Airport confirmed the occurrence stating the aircraft departed the runway shortly before takeoff for unknown reasons.The Aviation Herald received information that a brakes fault indication prompted the crew to reject takeoff from runway 29R a few seconds after initiating the takeoff roll, the aircraft subsequently veered left off the runway. A burst tyre may have caused the runway excursion.Related NOTAM:A1007/22 NOTAMNQ) OIIX/QMRLC/IV/NBO/A/000/999/A) OIIE B) 2203190744 C) 2203190940 ESTE) RWY 11L/29R CLSD DUE TO DISABLE ACFTMetars:OIIE 190930Z 15004KT 9999 FEW040 13/M08 Q1019=OIIE 190900Z 09010KT 9999 FEW040 14/M08 Q1019=OIIE 190830Z 13004KT 9999 FEW035 13/M05 Q1020=OIIE 190800Z 14006KT 9999 FEW035 12/M06 Q1020=OIIE 190730Z 11006KT 9999 FEW035 11/M06 Q1021=OIIE 190700Z 21004KT CAVOK 11/M06 Q1021=OIIE 190630Z 18003KT CAVOK 10/M05 Q1021=OIIE 190600Z 00000KT CAVOK 09/M04 Q1021=OIIE 190530Z 32006KT CAVOK 08/M02 Q1021=OIIE 190500Z 31006KT CAVOK 06/M02 Q1021=
A Jayawijaya Boeing 737-200, registration PK-JRW performing a non-scheduled freight flight from Jayapura to Wamena (Indonsia) with 4 crew and 12,556 kg of cargo, was accelerating for takeoff from Jayapura's runway 30 when at rotation speed a loud bang was heard and severe vibrations were felt. The pilot monitoring noticed the right hand engine (JT8D) indications were equal to idle power with the EGT fluctuating. The crew stopped the climb at 4500 feet, worked the engine severe damage checklists and returned to Jayapura for a safe landing.On Mar 9th 2022 Indonesia's KNKT released their preliminary report reporting a borescopic inspection showed:1. All blades of the engine compressor stage 1 until stage 5 were severely damage.2. The blades of the compressor stage 6 were dent and bent.3. The blades of the compressor stage 7 until stage 13 were bent, dent and (or) tear.4. The combustion chamber and the High Pressure (HP) and Low Pressure (LP)turbine were no damages.With respect to the right hand engine the KNKT reported:The last shop visit of the right engine was on 13 June 2016 (47,230 total engine hours and 37,418 total engine cycle). The shop visit was conducted at Atlantic Gas Turbine Center at Miami USA. Since the last shop visit of the right engine, the remaining cycle of HP Compressor stage 8 on the date of the occurrence was 1,226 cycles. The next shop visit was scheduled on April 2022 as the HP Compressor stage 8 is the limit life of the engine.The operator had not implemented the engine monitoring program as the program has not been mandated by the regulation.View of the right engine front (Photo: KNKT):
A UTAir Boeing 737-500, registration RA-73045 performing flight UT-379 from Moscow Vnukovo to Syktyvkar (Russia) with 58 passengers and 5 crew, was in the initial acceleration through about 24 knots for takeoff from runway 06 at 02:34L (23:34Z Mar 7th) when the aircraft began to veer right off the runway prompting the crew to reject takeoff, the aircraft however could not be stopped before running off the runway into a snow bank.

An Envoy Embraer ERJ-145, registration N655AE performing flight MQ-3660/AA-3660 from Springfield,MO to Chicago O'Hare,IL (USA) with 53 people on board, was cleared for takeoff and was accelerating for takeoff when tower cleared an airport operations vehicle (VAN7) to cross runway 14. When tower handed the Embraer over to departure about a minute after the clearance to VAN7, the flight crew commented: "That was beyond ... y'know that". The aircraft continued to Chicago for a safe landing.On Jul 24th 2018 the NTSB reported a runway incursion occurred when an operations vehicle (VAN7) crossed runway 14 while the Embraer was in the takeoff run in visual meteorological conditions. There were no injuries and no damage. The occurrence was rated an incident and is being investigated.On Mar 8th 2022 the NTSB released their final report concluding the probable cause of the incident was:The local controller failing to follow established facility directives and issuing a clearance for takeoff from a runway not under his control.The NTSB analysed:The runway incursion sequence began when the air traffic control (ATC) local controller (LC) cleared (ENY3660) for takeoff from an inactive runway that had been NOTAMd closed for arrivals to accommodate airfield mowing in the underrun.Interviews with controllers after the incident revealed SGF runway 14 had been NOTAMd closed by SGF Airport Operations for arrivals but was available for departures. There were mowers in the underrun of runway 14 in the runway safety area (RSA) that prohibited an overflight by landing air traffic. The NOTAM was published and available to aircrew and air traffic control via the FAA website and covered the period from 1230 UTC to 2100 UTC.Because runway 14/32 was closed to landing traffic, SGF standard operating procedures permitted the transfer of control for the runway to the ground controller (GC) position to use for runway crossings without the need for coordination with LC. Because GC now had operational control of the runway, the LC was required to request the use of the closed runway from the GC prior to issuing any clearances for takeoff.The pilot of ENY3660 requested to use runway 14 for a departure, and the GC approved the request and issued taxi instructions to runway 14. While the airplane was taxiing to runway 14, VAN7 requested to cross runway 14 while GC maintained operational control of the runway. Because GC had control of the runway, there was no requirement to coordinate the closed runway vehicle crossing with LC. When the pilot of ENY3660 called the LC ready for takeoff from runway 14, the LC issued a takeoff clearance without coordinating with GC. https://flightaware.com/live/flight/ENY3660/history/20180627/1751Z/KSGF/KORD
An Air Canada Boeing 767-300, registration C-FPCA performing flight AC-7125 from San Juan (Puerto Rico) to Toronto,ON (Canada), was accelerating for takeoff from San Juan's runway 08 when the crew received a cargo door warning and a warning bell sounded. The crew continued takeoff, climbed out to safety, worked the related checklists, the indication however persisted. The aircraft returned to San Juan for a safe landing on runway 08 about 25 minutes after departure.The Canadian TSB reported: "Maintenance found 4 latches were showing partial red on the visual indicators. The door was manually operated and when closed went hard stop on the latches. All but one visual red indicator were then showing correct.

A KLM Airbus A330-300, registration PH-AKE performing flight KL-678 from Calgary,AB (Canada) to Amsterdam (Netherlands) with 216 passengers and 12 crew, departed Calgary's runway 29, when during rotation for takeoff the tail contacted the runway surface. The crew remained unaware of the tail strike, however, a burning odour was noticed in the cabin immediately after becoming airborne. ATC was queried and suggested there may have been a tail strike. Cabin crew had not noticed anything unusual, the flight crew therefore decided to continue the flight to Amsterdam, where the aircraft landed without further incident. The Canadian TSB reported: During take-off on Runway 29, the tail contacted the runway surface during rotation. The flight crew were unaware a tail strike had occurred. They had detected a burning odor immediately after lift off and suspected the APU; it was a "bleeds off" take-off and the APU had been supplying conditioned air at the time of take-off. The flight crew consulted the ECAM 'wheel page' and 'APU page' and observed no abnormalities. ATC was queried and they suggested a possible tail strike. The cabin crew were consulted and they did not note anything unusual. The flight continued to EHAM with no further issues. When the aircraft arrived at the gate in EHAM, ground servicing crew noticed the damage to the underside of the empennage and the aircraft was removed from service for damage assessment.The aircraft is still on the ground in Amsterdam about 10 days after the tail strike.https://flightaware.com/live/flight/KLM678/history/20220208/2245Z/CYYC/EHAM
An Emirates Boeing 777-300, registration A6-EQI performing flight EK-231 from Dubai (United Arab Emirates) to Washington Dulles,DC (USA) with 354 passengers and 18 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Dubai's runway 30R when the aircraft rotated for takeoff past the end of the runway and became airborne just at the end of the runway end safety area. The aircraft continued to Washington for a landing without further incident.The aircraft performed the return flight EK-232 on schedule, then was grounded in Dubai and remained on the ground in Dubai for 4 days.According to Mode-S data transmitted by the aircraft's transponder the aircraft remained on the ground until accelerating through at least 216 knots over ground about 4400 meters/14400 feet past the runway threshold and about 90 meters short of the localizer antennas, was airborne at 75 feet AGL at 234 knots over ground already over the first residential houses past the runway (5640 meters/18500 feet past the runway threshold), then climbed out to safety.According to information The Aviation Herald received, the aircraft sustained some damage in the departure. There is also information, that a total of 4 crew members may have been dismissed as result of the occurrence.On Dec 27th 2021 Emirates Airlines released a crew alert to their pilots following the occurrence suggesting the crew had not picked up the previous flight crew had left the altitude setting at the Master Control Panel at airport elevation/00000 feet causing the flight director to not indicate takeoff rotation and climb out but instead indicate to maintain that altitude (ALT mode). The airline wrote:Crew Alert **********CO1408/21 COMPANY NOTAM - B777 MCP POWER UP DEFAULTS AND AFTERLANDING/ SHUT DOWN MCP CHANGESCREWS ARE REMINDED THAT THERE ARE NO FCOM NORMAL PROCEDURE (NP) REQUIREMENTS TO CHANGE THE MCP AFTER LANDING OR SHUTDOWN.THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN THE MCP "ALTITUDE WINDOW" HAS BEEN SET TO THE AIRPORT ELEVATION WHICH MAY CAUSE ISSUES ON THE SUBSEQUENT DEPARTURE.

CREWS SHALL NOT SET AIRPORT ELEVATION ON THE MCP AFTER LANDING OR SHUT DOWN.- FTPB 27DEC21On Feb 17th 2022 the United Arab Emirates GCAA released their preliminary report summarizing the sequence of events:On 19 December 2021, an Emirates Boeing 777-300ER (Extended Range) Aircraft, registration A6-EQI, operating a scheduled passenger flight number EK231, departed from Dubai International Airport (OMDB), the United Arab Emirates, for Washington Dulles International Airport (KIAD), the United States.The flight crew composed of four members divided into two sets A and B. Each set was comprised of one commander and one copilot. The Commander of set A operated as the pilot flying (PF) and the Copilot operated as the pilot monitoring (PM) for the flight.The Commander stated that during cockpit preparation, she noticed that the altitude selector was set to 0000 feet and she selected it to 4,000 feet, which was also verified by the flight data recorder. The selection of 4,000 feet on the altitude selector was in accordance with the planned standard instrument departure (SID) of SENPA 2F1.At 23:10:29 UTC, the Aircraft lifted off, and at 23:10:40 the landing gears were selected to up position (retracted).The Commander stated that after lift-off, and during climb, she followed the flight director command. However, the Aircraft rate of climb reached to a maximum of approximately 800 feet per minute. The flight crew were not able to adhere to published climb gradient of the SID due to the shallow climb.At 23:11:01, the takeoff/go-around (TOGA) switch was selected and the flight mode annunciations (FMA) were changed to TOGA/TOGA. The flight directors indicated climb attitude on the Commanders primary flight display (PFD). A flap 15 over-speed occurred as the airspeed increased towards 250 knots. The flight crew continued to their destination and landed uneventfully.No damage was found to the aircraft at destination. The commander (42, ATPL, 10,849 hours total, 6,567 hours on type) was assisted by a first officer (26, ATPL, 4,644 hours total, 3,426 hours on type).Metars:OMDB 200200Z VRB02KT CAVOK 19/15 Q1019 NOSIG=OMDB 200100Z 18003KT CAVOK 20/15 Q1018 NOSIG=OMDB 200000Z 18003KT CAVOK 20/15 Q1018 NOSIG=OMDB 192300Z 18002KT CAVOK 21/15 Q1019 NOSIG=OMDB 192200Z 18002KT CAVOK 21/14 Q1019 NOSIG=OMDB 192100Z 12003KT 060V220 CAVOK 22/15 Q1019 NOSIG=OMDB 192000Z VRB02KT CAVOK 23/14 Q1019 NOSIG=OMDB 191800Z 36004KT 330V080 CAVOK 25/14 Q1019 NOSIG=
An American Airlines Boeing 737-800, registration N344PP performing flight AA-2829 from New York JFK,NY to Phoenix,AZ (USA) with 142 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from JFK's runway 31L when the crew rejected takeoff at about 90 knots over ground subsequently reporting blown left tyres. The aircraft slowed safely and stopped about 1700 meters/5500 feet down the runway and became disabled.A replacement Boeing 737-800 registration N339PL reached Phoenix with a delay of about 4.5 hours.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in New York about 16.5 hours after the rejected takeoff.On Feb 16th 2022 the FAA reported: "AIRCRAFT ABORTED TAKEOFF AFTER TWO BLOWN TIRES AND LEFT WING AND FUSELAGE WERE DAMAGED, NEW YORK, NY.", the damage was unknown, the occurrence was rated an incident.The tyres seen after the rejected takeoff:
A SkyUp Airlines Boeing 737-700, registration UR-SQD performing flight SQP-591 from Kiev (Ukraine) to Lodz (Poland), was accelerating for takeoff from Kiev's runway 36R when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 45 KIAS) due to an indication "Speed Brake do not arm". The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway, the indication disappeared.The crew worked the related checklists, returned to the holding point and attempted another takeoff, however, needed to reject again due to the same indication, this time at about 65 KIAS. The aircraft subsequently returned to the apron.The Ukrainien NBAAI reported maintenance carried out analysis, deferred two defects according to minimum equipment list requirements and released the aircraft to perform the flight.About 70 minutes after the second rejected takeoff the aircraft departed and reached Lodz with a delay of about 90 minutes.The NBAAI continued that maintenance continued analysis on Jan 25th detecting and fixing a fault in the speed brake autostow shields (dampening system).
An Air Algerie Boeing 737-800, registration 7T-VKR performing flight AH-1157 from Lyon (France) to Annaba (Algeria) with 87 passengers and 6 crew, was cleared for takeoff and was accelerating for takeoff from Lyon's runway 35L when tower instructed the aircraft to stop immediately after noticing a snow plough was entering the runway. The crew rejected takeoff at low speed, the aircraft slowed and stopped on the runway, then taxied to the hold short line and departed without further incident about 7 minutes later.The French BEA reported the aerodrome was operating in night conditions, low visibility procedures were active. A ground controller cleared a snow plough onto the runway without coordinating with tower. Both controllers noticed the developing conflict, tower instructed AH-1157 to stop. The crew complied and brought the aircraft to a stop about 1200 meters/4000 feet short of the snow plough. The occurrence was rated a serious incident and is being investigated by the BEA.On Sep 7th 2021 the BEA released their Final report in French only, an English version is to be expected in due time. The AVH is going to summarize the English version as soon as it becomes available.On Feb 15th 2022 the BEA released their final report in English concluding the probable causes of the serious incident were:The runway incursion was linked to an erroneous clearance to enter the runway as a result of a coordination failure between the GND and LOC controllers and keeping the vehicles cleared to enter the runway on the GND frequency.The following factors contributed to the conflictual clearance and to keeping the use of an inappropriate frequency:- A high workload in an unusual context where the roles in the tower were sometimes poorly delimited.- The reopening of the inner runway after snow clearance although the snow clearance of the taxiways to join them to the runway required the snow-clearance vehicles to enter the runway.- Practices without a clear framework regarding the use of frequencies for the vehicles during temporary runway closures.- A stop bar configuration incompatible with the snow-clearance paths taken by the vehicles.The runway incursion, while it can be considered as a failure in itself, is above all else symptomatic of the confusion and disorganization generated by the management of the episode of snow.The following factors contributed to the confusion and disorganization:- A Snow Plan whose definition was too formal and in part, disconnected with operational realities.- Inaccurate measurements of the runway surface condition resulting in a high workload and difficulties with the snow-clearance strategy to be implemented.- Rules for regulating and suspending operations which were difficult to apply by the persons directly involved in traffic management and snow clearance.The BEA analysed:ScenarioOn 14 November 2019, there was a substantial snowfall in the Lyon region. This episode of snow was early in the season. It was forecast and the quantity of snowfall given. However, the relatively high temperatures during the episode of rain in the afternoon led all the actors at Lyon Saint-Exupéry airport to underestimate the coming phenomenon.The snow clearance operations were activated relatively late; only one of the two runways, runway 35R, had been treated as a preventive measure at around 18:00. The runway snow clearance team composed of a lead vehicle and two snowploughs was operational approximately two hours later.Runway 35L was closed to clear snow shortly before 20:00. This proved difficult as the runway directly turned white again behind the snowploughs. It was cleared 1 h 45 min later, however the taxiways still had to be cleared of snow and joined to the runway.When the snowplough lead vehicle asked for clearance to join taxiway A4 with the runway, the GND controller coordinated with the LOC controller. The latter requested that the snowploughs were asked to wait as there was an aeroplane on approach which was going to use the taxiway. A few minutes later, the GND controller was contacted by the lead vehicle again. After the arrival of the anticipated aeroplane, without new coordination, the GND controller cleared the snowploughs to enter the runway and kept them on the frequency. At the same time, the LOC controller cleared the crew of Air Algérie flight AH1157 to line up and take off.The GND controller did not follow the progression of the snowploughs and did not detect the conflict. He was discussing the surface conditions with the tower supervisor to help him set up a snow clearance strategy.The LOC controllers monitoring of the ground radar screen and the outside environment enabled him to identify the snowplough lead vehicles (cleared) entry into the runway safety area. The controllers request to reject the take-off run and the crews immediate reaction meant that a potential ground collision or the possible consequence of a late avoidance manoeuvre were avoided.GND controller  LOC controller coordinationThe SNA-CE OM indicated that the GND controller coordinated any request to enter the runway safety areas with the LOC sector.An initial coordination took place. However, it was unusual to have to manage snow clearance and the vocabulary used was not standardized. The expression, do the junctions, contained an ambiguity as to the need, or not, of entering the runway. The driver of the lead vehicle had removed this ambiguity when making his request to the GND controller, but the ambiguity continued to exist in the coordination between the GND controller and the LOC controller. After making the vehicles wait and having seen the arrival of the incoming aeroplane, the GND controller, without coordinating with the LOC controller again, cleared the snowploughs to enter the runway. However, six minutes later, the context had changed; there was a new departure and the instructions to wait for the incoming aeroplane before clearing the snowploughs to do the junctions were no longer adequate. The GND controller had not kept the departing aeroplane in mind once he had transferred responsibility for it to the LOC controller.The GND controller did not initiate the exchange with the lead vehicle and probably wanted to reply quickly to the driver without coordinating again. In addition, the GND controller may have been prompted not to coordinate with the LOC controller again in order not to increase the latters already high workload.The effectiveness of the coordination between the GND and LOC controllers thus broke down due to the use of unusual and ambiguous vocabulary. Along with this, the first coordination carried out several minutes previously was not updated.This coordination was all the more important in that the LOC and GND controllers did not have a shared support showing runway occupancy.Frequencies used for manoeuvring vehiclesThe OM indicated that on accepting a request to enter the runway safety area, the GND controller was to transfer the vehicle to the TWR frequency (managed by the LOC controller). However, the GND controller kept the vehicle on the GND frequency.This had also been the case when snow was cleared from the previous junction. When the lead vehicle driver asked for clearance to do the first junction between taxiway A3 and the runway, the GND controller cleared the driver after coordinating with the LOC controller assistant. Measurements were being made, vehicles on different frequencies were manoeuvring on the runway while being aware of each other. The fact that the vehicle was kept on the GND frequency was of no consequence at this point.In practice, it was unusual to keep a vehicle on the frequency despite it entering the safety areas. If a runway was closed with St Andrews crosses for example, the LOC sector and GND sector coordinated with each other to manage the crossing of runway 35L, with the approval of the tower supervisor.On that evening, the St Andrews crosses had not been positioned as it was initially thought that the snow clearance operation would not take more than an hour. However, the runway stayed closed for over one and a half hours. During this closure, the vehicles had travelled back and forth between the runway and the parking area, alternating between the TWR frequency and the VEHICLE GND frequency managed by the tower supervisor. Given the duration of the closure, it is possible that the runway was managed in an intermediate way: the logic was neither totally that of a runway closed for a short period with vehicles managed on the LOC frequency, nor totally that specified for the closure of a runway for more than one hour with St Andrews crosses.The GND controller had had the snowplough lead vehicle on his frequency when he held the LOC controller position and when he assisted the tower supervisor (he was then on a break for one and a half hours prior to taking the GND controller position). He had exchanged with the snowplough lead vehicle on the VEHICLE GND frequency when it was manoeuvring on the runway.The previous exchanges might have resulted in the overlapping of roles in the tower, and the distinction between the frequencies to be used lacking clarity.The lead vehicle driver was aware that he was not on the correct frequency. The need to change frequency may not have been clarified due to frequencies usually being grouped together at night and due to drivers never taking the initiative to change frequency.Stop bars and snow clearance circuitsIn LVP conditions, the stop bar system protects against runway incursions. The stop bars are lit to avert an unauthorized vehicle entering the runway. Opening the controllable stop bars allows the LOC controller to control entry into the runway safety areas and have an accurate idea of all the vehicles in this area.The fact that the stop bar lights were reflected in the snow increased the LOC controller's workload. He had to specify to aeroplanes taking taxiway B4 that the red light did not come from the stop bar which concerned them but was the reflection from the stop bar intended to prevent manoeuvres in the opposite direction.The vehicles manoeuvres were limited in the manoeuvring area in LVP conditions. There was a specific route for measurement vehicles designed to minimize the number of times stop bars were crossed. The routes intended for the runway inspection vehicles were not intended for the snow clearance vehicles.On the day of the incident, when runway 35L was closed, no stop bar was crossed to enter 35L via the access taxiway at the end of the runway. However, when runway 35L was reopened and the stop bars on taxiways A3 and A4 were lit and permanent, manoeuvring on these taxiways to enter runway 35L (and not to vacate it) necessarily meant that they would be crossed making this barrier against runway incursions ineffective.The BEA also analysed that fairly ineffective de-icing procedures substantially increased the tower's workload for coordination, revising flight plans. As in addition the tower also managed the approach frequencies, the frequency was congested as a result. In addition, the phone lines went busy as well, the BEA wrote:The tower supervisor was widely called upon to discuss the organization of the snow clearance. There were numerous exchanges with the snowplough lead vehicle concerning the choice of runways or taxiways to be cleared of snow and the condition of the runways. The decisions concerning the regulation of the traffic also led to numerous exchanges, notably with the operational duty manager and the operations manager.The telephone line and the VEHICLE GND frequency taken together were busy for more than 45% of the time in the hour and a half preceding the event.The controllers who were no longer on duty had remained behind to provide help in this unusual context. There were seven people in the tower at the time of the event, only four of them had an assigned role.The LOC controller continued to carry out certain tasks assigned to the tower supervisor which directly impacted the attention he paid to the vehicles and aircraft for which he was responsible.Metars:LFLL 142300Z 23004KT 1800 SN BR BKN002 OVC006 00/00 Q0996 R35R/591591 R35L/591591 TEMPO 0800 SN=LFLL 142230Z 26003KT 1800 SN BR SCT002 BKN003 OVC008 00/00 Q0996 R35R/591591 R35L/591591 TEMPO 0800 SN=COR LFLL 142200Z 23003KT 1800 SN BR SCT002 BKN003 OVC008 00/00 Q0997 R35R/591591 R35L/591591 TEMPO 0800 SN=LFLL 142130Z 00000KT 3000 SN BR BKN002 OVC016 00/00 Q0997 R88/590193 TEMPO 0800 SN=LFLL 142100Z 29005KT 2000 SN BR BKN002 OVC016 00/00 Q0997 R88/590193 TEMPO 0800 SN=LFLL 142030Z 26005KT 2000 SN BR BKN002 BKN007 00/00 Q0997 R88/590193 TEMPO 0800 SN=LFLL 142000Z 27005KT 3200 SN BR OVC002 00/00 Q0997 R88/590193 TEMPO 0800 SN=COR LFLL 141945Z 28004KT 2600 SN BR OVC002 00/00 Q0997 R88/590193 TEMPO 0800 SN=LFLL 141930Z VRB02KT 2600 SN BR BKN002 OVC010 00/00 Q0997 R88/590093 TEMPO 0800 SN OVC002=LFLL 141900Z 30004KT 2900 SN SCT003 SCT010 OVC013 00/00 Q0997 TEMPO 0800 SN BKN004=LFLL 141830Z 28003KT 2900 SN FEW003 BKN008 OVC012 00/00 Q0997 TEMPO 0800 SN BKN004=LFLL 141800Z 25001KT 2200 SN FEW007 OVC015 00/00 Q0998 TEMPO 2000 SN BKN004=
A Wizz Air Airbus A321-200, registration HA-LXL performing flight W6-4321 from Sofia (Bulgaria) to Beauvais (France), was accelerating for takeoff on Sofia's runway 09 when the crew rejected takeoff at 80 knots reporting unreliable airspeed indications. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground for about 8 hours before returning to service.Two other company A321 needed to divert to Budapest due to unreliable airspeed indications the same day, see Incident: Wizz A321 at Sofia on Feb 26th 2018, unreliable airspeed and Incident: Wizz A321 at Sofia on Feb 26th 2018, unreliable airspeed indications.On Mar 8th 2018 Bulgaria's AAIU reported the aircraft had been parked at the apron for more than 6 hours in low temperatures and snow fall. The aircraft was subsequently de-iced. During the takeoff roll the airspeed indicators showed a wide range of unreliable values and variations prompting the crew to reject takeoff. The occurrence was rated a serious incident and is being investigated by Bulgaria's AAIU.On Feb 13th 2022 the Bulgarian AAIU released their final report into all three occurrences at Sofia of Feb 26th 2018 concluding the probable causes of the serious incidents were:Based on the analysis performed, the Commission points out that the serious incident resulted from the following causes:1. Non-compliance with the adverse weather conditions of snowfall by the ground crews performing and participating in the preparation of the aircraft for the flights related to the serious incident.2. Admission to flight of the aircraft with the presence of ice after De-icing procedure with anti-icing fluid by the ground crew, organizing and performing the treatment.The AAIU analysed that there were no deficiencies in the contracts regarding de-icing procedures carried out by the contracted ground handling operator. There also were no deficiencies in the task cards with respect to de-icing at Sofia Airport that day.The AAIU also analysed that there were no deficiencies in the flight crews' flight preparations and actions. The AAIU wrote:The Commission did not detect the weaknesses in the actions of the flight crews, errors and deviations from the prescribed procedures. Pre-flight preparation has been thoroughly conducted, severe weather and RWY conditions have been foreseen. It is a pilots responsibility to reject or to continue take-off and the decision to ensure safety has been taken in time deficit.-Thanks to the pilots skills, they have coped with the difficult situation and the flights have ended uneventfully.The AAIU wrote however:There is no evidence of snow removal and De-icing protective spraying on the front of the fuselage of the aircraft. The terms and responsibilities of the contract between the aviation operator and airport operators are set out in the ground handling agreement cover sheet in force at the time of the event.The AAIU wrote:The aircrafts of WIZZ AIR landed the day before at Sofia Airport and during their stay were covered with a significant amount of snow, and the fuselage of the aircraft has cooled to temperatures below 0°. According to the explanations of the ground crew during the preparation, the aircraft were treated with Type II liquid in the areas of the wing and tails, but not in the area of the front part of the cabin above the receivers for dynamic and static pressure.In preparation for the flight, the cockpit and passenger cabin are heated, as a result of which the snow accumulated on the aircraft of the aircraft melted and running down, which in this area has a lower temperature for obvious reasons and the melted water freeze in the form of ice ridges. Such ice ridges are often observed on the lateral and lower surface of the fuselage of aircraft when the snow in the upper part of the fuselage is not removed and melted after warming the aircraft cabins during parking on apron, taxiing or waiting for De-icing procedure or other delay before takeoff. (Editorial note: watch the similiarities to this serious incident: Incident: S7 A21N at Magadan on Dec 2nd 2021, unreliable airspeed).The AAIU continued analysis:All aircraft of the "family" of Airbus A320 - (A318, A319, A320 and A321) are similar in appearance, with small differences in dimensions. The procedures for anti-icing and de-icing of the different operators are similar. Quality control of the completed activity is performed in the De-icing Pads by a ground crew who reports by the radio to the flight crew about the results. In all three cases, the inspections were carried out by three different personnel who did not detect the untreated lower nose fuselage of the aircraft. The lack of adequate training of the staff performing the work directly and of the controlling personnels after that has significantly contributed to the poor quality and incomplete de-icing/anti-icing procedure. As a result, pilots are unprepared for the difficult situation of running take-off in bad weather and poor surface friction on RWY.

A TAAG Angola Airlines Boeing 737-700, registration D2-TBJ performing flight DT-582 from Maputo (Mozambique) to Luanda (Angola), was accelerating for takeoff from Maputo's runway 05 when the crew rejected takeoff at about 80 KIAS due to an airspeed disagree between captain's and first officer's instruments. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The airline reported a bee was found in one of the pitot tubes forcing the crew to reject takeoff. The passengers disembarked and were taken to a hotel. The aircraft was handed to maintenance to return it into an airworthy condition and was returned to service.The aircraft departed again the following day after about 28 hours on the ground and reached Luanda with a delay of 28:15 hours.
An Austrian Airlines Embraer ERJ-195, registration OE-LWO performing flight OS-313 from Vienna (Austria) to Stockholm (Sweden), was accelerating the engines for takeoff from Vienna's runway 34 when the crew rejected takeoff and returned to the apron due to a low oil quantity indication for the right hand engine (CF34). After the crew shut the right hand engine down, a smell of fuel became apparent in the cockpit.The aircraft remained on the ground in Vienna for about 7.5 hours before returning to service.
An Azimuth Sukhoi Superjet 100-95, registration RA-89136 performing flight A4-216 from Kazan to Rostov (Russia), was accelerating for takeoff from runway 29 when the crew rejected takeoff at about 80 knots over ground due to engine (SaM146) vibrations. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The aircraft remained on the ground for about 6.5 hours, then departed for the flight again and reached Rostov with a delay of about 6 hours.
A British Airways Boeing 777-200, registration G-YMMR performing flight BA-81 from London Heathrow,EN (UK) to Accra (Ghana), was accelerating for takeoff from Heathrow's runway 27L when the crew rejected takeoff at about 80 KIAS due to unreliable air speed indications on all three pitot systems. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.A replacement Boeing 777-200 registration G-YMMA reached Accra with a delay of about 5:15 hours.The AAIB reported the occurrence was rated a serious incident and is being investigated, all three pitot systems provided unreliable air speed indications. In addition, British Airways had two more unreliable air speed events involving an A320-200 with 2 blocked pitot tubes and an A320-200N with one blocked pitot tube in about the same time frame.The AAIB released their bulletin, handling a number of similiar occurrences between Jun 9th 2021 and Jul 19th 2021 in this report, and concluded:Over a short period of time, several aircraft suffered air data problems related to the blockage of pitot probes by insect nests.From an operational perspective, pilot training, preparedness and effective TEM should be considered key elements for assuring early detection of pitot/static system blockages in the takeoff roll, thus minimising the hazards associated with high-speed rejections. As the airline industry increases its operational tempo toward pre-pandemic levels, operator support for crews balancing commercial pressures against reduced recency will be an important enabler for safely rebuilding operational fluency.Insects blocking aircraft pitot/static systems is not a new hazard, but one likely exacerbated at Heathrow in 2021 due to the unusually low operational tempo resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. Reduced traffic levels and human activity resulted in a surge of insect activity during the pandemic lockdowns. With less aircraft activity, including less noise and jet efflux to deter the insects, the parked aircraft made an attractive opportunity, with the pitot probes providing an ideal construction site for nests.The high level of insect activity in 2021 could lead to a larger number of insects emerging in the spring of 2022. Therefore, even though traffic levels and aircraft utilisation are expected to increase in 2022, the seasonal risk of insects blocking pitot probes could be significant. Proactive habitat management and aircraft monitoring will be required to mitigate the risk. With the move towards greener aviation, this may become even more important in the future.With respect to G-YMMR the AAIB summarized the sequence of events:Pre-eventBefore the incident flight, G-YMMR had been positioned at Heathrow for six days, most of the time in the overspill parking area at Terminal 4, but also on a maintenance stand at the north-eastern area of the airport. In preparation for flight, it was towed to Terminal 5 ahead of its scheduled departure.The eventThe flight crew did not detect any system anomalies until early in the takeoff roll. Just after the PM verbally confirmed that takeoff thrust was set, both pilots looked at their flight displays and saw their airspeed indicators were not reading. The commander made the executive Stop call and the aircraft was brought to a halt on the runway without further incident. After reviewing the aircraft status and noting that the brake temperatures were not excessively high, the flight crew taxied the aircraft back to the terminal. Post-event actions Inspection of the aircraft pitot probes showed that both the right and centre probes were blocked. The nature of this debris (Figure 3) was similar to that found on G-EUUO and G-TTNH. However, with the aircraft having been parked at a different location to the other two aircraft, the operator now considered that this was a wider issue, and the event was notified to the AAIB and the aircraft quarantined for inspection....Post-event maintenanceAs two of G-YMMRs probes had been found to be blocked (right and centre), all three probes were removed. The Total Air Temperature probes and static ports were inspected and found to be clear. The pitot/static system was flushed, and new probes fitted at the left, centre and right locations. No further debris was found during the system flushes. No previous reports of pitot/static system or ASI system defects had been reported on the aircraft and, following testing, it was released back to service.One of the blocked pitot tubes (Photo: AAIB):
A LATAM Brasil Airbus A321-200, registration PT-XPM performing flight LA-3533 from Curitiba,PR to Brasilia,DF (Brazil), was accelerating for takeoff from Curitiba's runway 15 when the crew needed to reject takeoff at high speed (about 100 knots over ground) after the left hand engine (CFM56) had ingested a bird. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The flight was cancelled.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground 3 days 11 hours later.
A Ryanair Boeing 737-800, registration EI-ENH performing flight FR-9893 from Malaga,SP (Spain) to Liverpool,EN (UK) with 190 passengers and 6 crew, was cleared to take off Malaga's runway 13 and was commencing takeoff.A Ryanair Boeing 737-800, registration EI-DYR performing flight FR-4058 from Hamburg (Germany) to Malaga,SP (Spain) with 179 passengers and 6 crew, was on final approach to Malaga's runway 13 cleared to land on runway 13 in view of the departing traffic.The landing aircraft touched down on runway 13 before the departing aircraft became airborne. Spain's CIAIAC commented on that very fact: "The sequence of events outlined above led to a loss of separation and, given that both aircraft were on the runway at the same time, a runway incursion."The CIAIAC released their final report concluding the probable causes of the incident were:The investigation has determined that the incident occurred because an aircraft was given clearance to land on a runway that was occupied by another aircraft in the process of taking off, without respecting the regulatory distances.Deficient planning by the air traffic controller, who took advantage of a gap between two landings to authorise a take-off, is considered to have been a contributing factor in the incident.Furthermore, given the immediate danger posed by the loss of regulatory separation, the absence of decision-making (to cancel the take-off, for example) by the air traffic controller is also deemed to have been a factor.The CIAIAC analysed:The EI-DYR aircraft on approach with callsign RYR9UD notified the air traffic controller that they were proceeding to 500 ft at 19:53:21. The air traffic controller responded to aircraft RYR9UD, instructing it to continue and await late landing clearance.At that moment, aircraft RYR9UD was established on final at 1.7 NM from the threshold of RWY 13 and aircraft RYR75JV was taxiing towards RWY 13. The air traffic controller did not recognise the imminent danger resulting from the loss of regulatory separation and continued with the initial plan, instructing the aircraft to continue on approach without informing the aircraft that was about to take off.Given that the inbound traffic was 1.7NM from the runway threshold and the outbound aircraft was midway between the holding point and the runway threshold, the air traffic controller could have prevented a loss of separation and, therefore, a potentially hazardous situation between the inbound and outbound traffic in a single runway configuration by instructing the arriving traffic to abort its approach and cancelling the take-off of the taxiing aircraft.However, at 19:53:59 UTC, the LCL TWR LEMG controller cleared the RYR9UD aircraft to land with the preceding traffic in view on runway 13 when it was established at 200 ft of altitude AMSL, and aircraft RYR75JV was on its take-off run on RWY 13 at a speed of 90 kt (GS). The distance between the two aircraft was 0.4 NM.The landing was authorised when the aircraft was practically above the runway threshold, allowing it to cross said threshold while the outbound aircraft was still on the runway. Moreover, there was no degree of assurance that the regulatory separation could be maintained, as the aircraft on approach was travelling faster than the aircraft on take-off, increasingly reducing the separation between the aircraft. The air traffic controller failed to anticipate the required separation between the aircraft....The landing EI-DYR aircraft touched down on the runway with a ground speed of 141 kt. For its part, the EI-ENH aircraft was on its take-off run executing the rotation manoeuvre, with a ground speed of 157 kt. The distance between the two aircraft was 520 m (0.28 NM). This was the point of minimum separation between the two aircraft.
A Kalitta Boeing 747-400, registration N703CK performing flight K4-368 from Los Angeles,CA to Honolulu,HI (USA) with 7 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Los Angeles' runway 25R at about 03:06L (11:06Z) when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 110 knots over ground) after colliding with an object on the runway. The aircraft slowed and stopped on the runway, the crew reported severe damage to the aircraft after hitting something big on the runway, they were considering to evacuate the aircraft and requested assistance to check the aircraft for damage and fire. Tower reported there was excessive smoke coming from the nose gear while slowing to a stop. Emergency services responded and found a trash bin, that had been blown onto the runway and had hit the nose gear of the 747. Both tyres of the nose gear had blown as result.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Los Angeles about 11 hours after the rejected takeoff.A replacement Boeing 747-400 registration N741CK is estimated to reach Honolulu with a delay of 9 hours.On Mar 20th 2020 the NTSB reported they have opened an investigation into the occurrence rated an accident, however, the investigators will not travel in support of the investigation.On Jan 7th 2022 the NTSB released their final report concluding the probable cause of the accident was:An unavoidable collision with a garbage dumpster that had blown into the path of the airplane during the takeoff roll.The NTSB analysed:The captain stated that he was the pilot flying and, during the takeoff roll on runway 25R, between 80 and 110 knots (V1 was 131 knots), he noticed a large object "moving right to left at a good speed". A fraction of a second later it passed under the nose and impacted the airplane. He said that the impact was loud, and the airplane "settled", followed by severe vibration in the airplane. He immediately rejected the takeoff and stopped on the runway.At the time of the takeoff, winds were reported to be 15 knots, gusting to 28 knots, from 340 degrees.Authorities at the Los Angeles World Airports determined that the object blown onto the runway was a garbage dumpster.Metars:KLAX 031253Z 35010G27KT 10SM FEW045 FEW150 12/M07 A2984 RMK AO2 PK WND 35029/1221 SLP101 T01171072=KLAX 031153Z 34015G28KT 10SM FEW045 FEW150 12/M06 A2985 RMK AO2 PK WND 34030/1128 SLP105 T01171061 10161 20117 55002=KLAX 031053Z 35016G24KT 10SM FEW040 FEW065 SCT150 12/M07 A2984 RMK AO2 PK WND 33030/1017 SLP101 T01221072=KLAX 030953Z 34011G24KT 320V040 10SM SCT040 BKN050 BKN150 13/M06 A2985 RMK AO2 PK WND 36028/0942 SLP105 T01281061=KLAX 030853Z 35014G24KT 10SM FEW020 BKN040 BKN050 BKN150 14/M07 A2985 RMK AO2 PK WND 34026/0842 SLP106 T01391072 50003=KLAX 030753Z 33013G18KT 10SM FEW020 BKN040 BKN150 14/M08 A2986 RMK AO2 PK WND 01027/0706 SLP108 T01441083 401940117=KLAX 030653Z 35011G23KT 10SM FEW020 FEW050 SCT150 15/M08 A2986 RMK AO2 PK WND 01027/0621 SLP109 T01501083=

A Saudi Arabian Airlines Airbus A330-300, registration HZ-AQ20 performing flight SV-305 from Jeddah (Saudi Arabia) to Cairo (Egypt), was cleared for takeoff from runway 34L and commenced takeoff although a vehicle conducting a runway inspection was still on the runway.Saudi Arabia's AIB reported the flight crew remained unaware of the vehicle as they were accelerating and rotating for takeoff at Vr. The airfield operations officers (AOOs) in the vehicle did not monitor tower frequency and therefore missed the takeoff clearance for SV-305. In total surprise they saw the aircraft accelerating towards them and sped their car off the runway onto taxiway B5. The separation reduced to 7 seconds and 120 meters. The flight crew did not report the occurrence, they probably did not notice the occurrence. The AOOs as well as tower controller deviated from standard operating procedures. Air Traffic Management elements are considered to have contributed to the occurrence rated a serious incident.Metars:OEJN 102000Z 14005KT 9999 FEW040 33/21 Q1006 NOSIG=OEJN 101900Z 06004KT 9999 FEW040 33/21 Q1007 NOSIG=OEJN 101800Z 36004KT 9999 FEW040 34/22 Q1006 NOSIG=OEJN 101700Z 33006KT 9999 FEW040 34/23 Q1006 NOSIG=OEJN 101600Z 33008KT 9999 SCT040 34/23 Q1006 NOSIG=OEJN 101500Z 30012KT 9999 SCT040 35/22 Q1005 NOSIG=

A Regional Jet Canadair CRJ-900 on behalf of LOT Polish Airlines, registration ES-ACD performing flight LO-8811 from Gallivare to Arvidsjaur (Sweden) with 19 passengers and 4 crew, was lined up on the runway of Gallivare, when the crew accelerated the engines for takeoff and released the brakes, the aircraft however began to veer left. The crew was unable to correct, rejected takeoff and applied brakes. The aircraft came to a stop with the nose gear about 2 meters off the runway edge.Sweden's SHK opened an investigation into the occurrence. The Dutch DSB provides assistance with the investigation due to recent maintenance conducted in the Netherlands. On Sep 9th 2021 the SHK released their final report concluding the probable cause of the incident was:The cause for the excursion was that the sensor for the nose wheel steering was incorrectly installed and that the prescribed functional test after installation of the sensor was not performed according to the maintenance manual. This led to that nose wheel steering with the rudder pedals, steered the aircraft in the opposite direction from what was expected.Contributing factors:- The maintenance manual lacked sufficiently clear instructions to determine the correct function of the sensor before installation.- The description in the maintenance manual on how to install the sensor did not include sufficiently detailed instructions on how the required sensor shaft alignment could be achieved in regards to the sensor design, function and the position.- The lack of verification of the steering deflections with the rudder pedals during the function test indicates deficiencies in the maintenance organisations and technicians routines regarding line maintenance planning and grouping of tasks for signoff to prevent omissions during maintenance.- The airworthiness organisations participation in the safety management system lacked a focus on identifying risks between the maintenance organisation and the airworthiness organisation.The SHK summarized the occurrence:The incident occurred during a scheduled flight from Gällivare to Stockholm. At the time, the runway was dry and the weather conditions were good.The airworthiness organisation had decided to replace the rudder control sensor (RVDT) despite the fact that there was no open remark in the technical logbook.The replacement was carried out by the contracted maintenance organisation.The crew was aware that technical maintenance had been performed on the aircrafts nose wheel steering system the day before the flight.After starting the engines, the commander taxied out the aircraft to take off from runway 30.At take-off, the aircraft immediately turned left after the brakes were released and the aircraft began to roll. The commander tried to correct the course with the right rudder pedal to steer the aircraft to the right without stopping the aircrafts turning movement to the left. The commander decided to abort the take-off and the aircraft finally stopped with the nose wheel outside the runway.Flight data showed that nose wheel steering with the rudder pedals steered the aircraft in the opposite direction from what was expected, which was also found in the technical examination.An examination showed that the mechanical stop inside the rudder control sensor had been broken off. The examination also showed that if the mechanical stop is broken off, the missing spline on the sensor shaft can be installed two splines off from the rig position, without any systems warnings. The polarity of the electrical output signal will then be reversed, resulting in that steering with the rudder pedals steers the aircraft in the opposite direction.The maintenance manual did not describe that a verification of the sensor function should be performed before installation. The maintenance manual also lacked a clear description how the sensor shaft should be aligned at installation. After installation of the sensor, neither the steering direction nor the angle of the deflection was verified during a function test of the nose wheel steering with the rudder pedals.The cause for the excursion was that the sensor for the nose wheel steering was incorrectly installed and that the prescribed functional test after installation of the sensor was not performed according to the maintenance manual. This led to that the nose wheel steering with the rudder pedals steered the aircraft in the opposite direction from the expected.
A Singapore Airlines Airbus A350-900, registration 9V-SMU performing flight SQ-377 from Barcelona,SP (Spain) to Milan Malpensa (Italy) with 28 people on board, had been cleared to line up runway 07R and wait. The crew however commenced their takeoff roll without clearance and departed creating a conflict with another aircraft on final approach to runway 02. The aircraft continued to Milan for a landing without further incident.On Sep 8th 2021 Singapore's AIB released their final report concluding the probable causes of the incident were:- The flight crew had believed that they were the only aircraft traffic in the vicinity. The low workload in traffic monitoring due to the low aerodrome traffic could have resulted in some form of reduced alertness by the flight crew.- The flight crew claimed that they heard a take-off clearance when there had not been one. There was no readback of take-off clearance by the flight crew.- The flight crew had checked the approach path of Runway 07R and found it to be clear. The PF mentioned checking the surrounding vicinity for approaching aircraft traffic but did not detect the A320 that was approaching Runway 02.- Although the tower controller had managed the take-off situation appropriately, it would be desirable if the flight crew could have been made aware of other aircraft traffic in the vicinity. The tower controller could have assisted by providing additional information (when issuing the line-up clearance) to the flight crew of the departure aircraft (such as stating the order of the aircraft in the queue with respect to other aircraft traffic), so as to enhance the awareness of the flight crew to the presence of other aircraft.The SAIB reported the aircraft carried two crews, one for the sector to operate from Barcelona to Milan and the second one for the sector from Milan to Singapore. The first officer to operate out of Barcelona (41, ATPL, 5,066 hours total, 251 hours on type) was pilot flying, the captain to operate out of Barcelona (49, ATPL, 9,807 hours total, 313 hours on type) was pilot monitoring. The senior first officer of the second flight crew to operate out of Milan (48, ATPL, 11,699 hours total, 1,750 hours on type) occupied the observer seat. The SAIB reported Barcelona was operating runway 07R for departures and runway 02 for arrivals, the approach path to runway 02 crossing runway 07R at low altitude.The SAIB described the sequence of events:The aerodrome traffic at the time was low. The flight crew did not see any other aircraft traffic on the ground during their taxiing to the holding point of Runway 07R. The recording of the aerodromes ground surface movement radar showed that the A350 was the only aircraft taxiing to Runway 07R at that time. According to the ATC voice recording and the video recording from the ground surface movement radar, as the A350 was taxiing down Taxiway K to the holding point of Runway 07R, the ground controller instructed the A350s flight crew to contact the tower controller (on radio frequency 118.105 MHz) when they were ready for departure. The flight crew acknowledged and continued clearing the tasks according to the Before Take-off SOP. They switched to the tower frequency just before reaching the holding point of Runway 07R.As soon as the flight crew switched to the tower frequency, they were asked by the tower controller if they were ready for departure. The flight crew confirmed that they were, and the tower controller instructed them to line up and wait. The flight crew read back line up and wait. The flight crew then continued completing the remainder of the tasks on their Before Take-off SOP as they taxied the A350 from the holding point onto Runway 07R to line up.According to the PF, at the holding point of Runway 07R (the aircraft was then facing the direction of 160 degrees) and prior to entering Runway 07R, he scanned the Navigation Display (ND) and did not see any aircraft on the approach path to Runway 07R or in the vicinity. He then visually scanned the approach path of Runway 07R and the area ahead of his aircraft and did not see any aircraft either. The PM checked that the PF was taxiing correctly for the line-up while the flight crew continued completing their checklist. The PF visually checked that the take-off runway in front of them was clear of traffic.After the tower controller had issued the line up and wait clearance to the A350, he went on to provide instructions to a business jet that had just landed on Runway 02. His plan was to land the next aircraft (an Airbus A320) that was approaching Runway 02 before issuing the take-off clearance to the A350 which he had instructed to wait on Runway 07R.While the tower controller was still speaking to the business jet that had just landed on Runway 02, he saw the A350 begin a take-off roll on Runway 07R. The tower controller assessed that there was sufficient separation between the A350 and the approaching A320, and that the A350 would be clear of the approach path of Runway 02. Hence, he decided that it was safe to allow the A350 to continue taking off rather than to instruct the A350 to abort the take-off roll.The tower controller subsequently contacted the A350s flight crew, after the aircraft was airborne, to inform them that they had not been given take-off clearance and that they were number two in the sequence (i.e. the second aircraft in the queue and was to only take off after the approaching A320 had landed). In this incident, the closest separation distance between the A350 and the approaching A320 was about 2.8 nautical miles (NM).The SAIB analysed:Situational awareness of flight crewThe A350 flight crew had believed that their flight was the only aircraft traffic in the vicinity because:1) The aerodrome traffic was low at the time and they did not see any aircraft taxiing or landing while they were taxiing to Runway 07R.2) They did not hear any radio communication made between the ATC and other aircraft.If the flight crew had seen the business jet landing or had heard the tower controller communicating to another aircraft over the radio, the flight crew might have been alerted to the presence of other aircraft landing on Runway 02 and might have paid more attention to other approaching traffic to Runway 02.Due to the low aerodrome traffic, the flight crew were likely having low workload in traffic monitoring. However, it has been known that an individuals performance and situational awareness may not be optimum in a low workload situation. In this case, the low workload could have resulted in some form of reduced alertness by the flight crew.Readback by the flight crewThe A350 took off without ATC take-off clearance. The flight crew recalled having received the take-off clearance. However, ATC recording showed that no take-off clearance was issued to the A350. Other than the flight crews line up and wait readback, there was no other readback by the flight crew. Based on the evidence collected, the investigation team would have to discount their recollection.The PM and PF were not able to explain how they might have heard a take-off clearance.Operations involving intersecting runwaysBefore entering Runway 07R, the flight crew were concerned primarily about checking for traffic on the approach path of Runway 07R. The flight crew mentioned that they had confirmed visually and on the ND that there was no traffic approaching Runway 07R.For most aerodromes, including those with more than one runway in operation, the flight crew mainly rely on ATC guidance to safely navigate their aircraft around and to ensure safe separation with other aircraft. In addition to ATCs instructions, the ND could act as an information tool to provide the flight crew with additional awareness on surrounding aircraft traffic.The flight crew also mentioned that they were aware that Runway 02 was the arrival runway in use. After checking the ND for approaching traffic to Runway 07R, the PF mentioned scanning the ND briefly and looking out ahead to get an awareness of the surrounding aircraft traffic, but he did not notice any traffic.At the time when the A350 was about to enter Runway 07R, the approaching A320 should have been within range to be shown on the ND. The investigation team is not able to determine if the approaching A320 was visible in the horizon or if the ND had displayed the approaching A320 or whether the PF has seen the A320 displayed on the ND.ATCs provision of additional informationAfter the A350 had taken off, the tower controller informed the flight crew that they were the second aircraft in the queue. This piece of information about being in a queue if provided to the flight crew together with the clearance to line up, would have been useful in alerting the flight crew that their aircraft was in a queue and that they had to wait for further ATC instructions before taking off.Runway Layout and taxi route (Graphics: SAIB):
A Cargojet Airways Boeing 767-300 freighter, registration C-GUAJ performing freight flight W8-1328 from Tokyo Narita (Japan) to Vancouver,BC (Canada) with 2 crew, was departing Narita's runway 16R at 11:32L (02:32Z) when during rotation for takeoff the tail of the aircraft contacted the runway surface emitting a puff of smoke. The aircraft climbed out and continued to Vancouver, where the aircraft landed about 8:15 hours later.Japan's Ministry of Transport reported the ATC controller noticed the tail strike, a runway inspection revealed contact marks of about 31 meters length, width about 15cm and depth of 1-2cm, one of the runway center line lights was also damaged. The crew, assuming nothing was wrong, continued to destination. The runway was closed for about 90 minutes to replace the light and return the runway to a safe condition. A detailed investigation into the occurrence was opened.The aircraft remained on the ground in Vancouver for about 2.5 hours, then continued for the next sector of W8-1328 to Chicago O'Hare,IL (USA).On Sep 7th 2021 the Canadian TSB reported:After take off, the EICAS (Engine-indicating and crew-alerting system) message "R TAIL HYD VAL" in amber appeared. RJAA Tower reported smoke from the tail section on rotation before switching the flight crew to departure frequency. After flaps retraction flight crew requested to level off at 10000 feet (cleared altitude was 23000 feet), then reached QRH which reads "R TAIL FLT CONTROL SHUTOFF SWITCH MUST BE ON FOR FLIGHT". Flight Control Shutoff Valves on P61 panel indicated R TAIL SHUTOFF VALVE "ON" in white as well as "OFF" in amber. The switch is guarded and says "GND USE ONLY". Flight crew then contacted Maintenance control via Sat phone. Maintenance suggestion was to do nothing with the shutoff valve. Other systems which could have been affected if the tail strike has occurred, such as hydraulics and cabin pressure looked normal. Flight crew also concluded, after discussion with maintenance, that the lack of the ''TAIL STRIKE EICAS'' message made the flight safe to destination . Before landing in YVR and after extending the gears, EICAS message "TAILSKID" in amber appeared. QRH actions were performed and uneventful landing was completed. Post-flight inspection by the Maintenance crew revealed the orange paint on the tail skid was partially removed but the indication on the strut showed no sign of compression. Aircraft was returned to service with tail skid repair deferred on MEL (Minimum equipment list).https://flightaware.com/live/flight/CJT1328/history/20210829/0247Z/RJAA/CYVRMetars:RJAA 290430Z 08012KT 9999 FEW035 30/23 Q1011 NOSIG=RJAA 290400Z 07011KT 9999 FEW035 BKN070 30/22 Q1012 NOSIG=RJAA 290330Z 06011KT 9999 FEW030 SCT070 BKN/// 31/23 Q1012 BECMG 08010KT=RJAA 290300Z 09012KT 9999 FEW030 SCT060 BKN/// 30/23 Q1012 NOSIG=RJAA 290230Z 07011KT 030V110 9999 FEW025 SCT030 BKN/// 30/23 Q1012 NOSIG=RJAA 290200Z 08012KT 9999 FEW030 SCT040 BKN/// 31/24 Q1012 NOSIG=RJAA 290130Z 07012KT 9999 FEW025 SCT030 BKN/// 30/23 Q1012 NOSIG=RJAA 290100Z 06013KT 9999 FEW030 30/23 Q1012 BECMG 08012KT=RJAA 290030Z 08013KT 9999 FEW025 30/22 Q1012 NOSIG=RJAA 290000Z 07013KT 030V100 9999 FEW020 SCT030 30/23 Q1012 NOSIG=RJAA 282330Z 07013KT 030V120 9999 FEW015 SCT030 BKN070 29/23 Q1012 NOSIG=RJAA 282300Z 06011KT 020V090 9999 FEW006 SCT030 BKN070 29/24 Q1012 BECMG TL0000 08012KT=Video of the takeoff out of a live stream (Video: love4649jack):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5thzdsa5MxA

The aircraft vacated the runway and returned to the apron.A replacement A320-200 registration N660AW reached Milwaukee with a delay of 4 hours.The occurrence aircraft returned to service after about 21 hours on the ground.
A Rossiya Airbus A319-100 on behalf of Aeroflot, registration VQ-BAQ performing flight SU-6316 from Krasnodar to St. Petersburg (Russia) with 128 passengers and 5 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Krasnodar's runway 23L when the crew rejected takeoff at just about low speed (about 82 knots over ground) due to electrical problems. The aircraft slowed safely.Rosaviatsia reported ATC decided to have the aircraft towed to the apron to have the cause of the failure investigated. The passengers disembarked to a sterile area.The aircraft was able to depart about 5:15 hours later and reached St. Petersburg with a delay of 5 hours.
A Jetstar Airbus A320-200, registration VH-VFF performing flight JQ-930 from Brisbane,QL to Cairns,QL (Australia), was accelerating for takeoff from Brisbane's runway 01L when the crew received a right hand engine (V2527) stall indication at about 40 KIAS associated with a right yaw. The crew rejected takeoff and managed to stop the aircraft on the runway. Tower informed the crew they had seen a flash from the right hand engine, the crew of another aircraft reported seeing flames from the right hand engine. Emergency services attended to and inspected the aircraft, the aircraft subsequently taxied to the apron, where both engines were shut down.A visual inspection revealed debris in the tail pipe of the right hand engine. A borescopic inspection revealed damage to the tips of some compressor blades requiring the replacement of the engine.Australia's TSB opened a short investigation into the occurrence rated an incident.On Aug 16th 2021 the ATSB released their final report concluding the probable causes of the incident were:- A screwdriver tip, left in a fairing screw or bleed duct, travelled through the high-pressure compressor (HPC) section of the right engine before becoming lodged in the combustion section. This resulted in impact damage to HPC blades and vanes.- Fatigue cracks initiated at damaged locations in at least one HPC blade and vane, with one crack propagating to failure. This resulted in secondary damage to the engine and surging ontake-off.The ATSB summarized the sequence of events:On the morning of 23 October 2020, an Airbus A320-232 was being operated by Jetstar Airways on a flight from Brisbane to Cairns, Queensland. The first officer was the pilot flying and the captain was the pilot monitoring.After push back, the first officer taxied the aircraft for a planned take-off on runway 01L. The crew completed the pre-take-off checks during the taxi in anticipation of a rolling start to the take-off.After being cleared for take-off on approach to the runway, the aircraft was lined up and, without stopping, the thrust levers were set for Flex.2 The crew reported that as both engines spooled up to the requested power setting, a vibration and popping noise could be heard that rapidly increased in frequency and volume. At the same time, the aircraft diverged to the right of the runway centreline despite the first officer applying full left rudder pedal deflection. In response, the captain immediately selected reverse thrust and brought the aircraft to a stop. The aircraft reached a maximum ground speed of 30 knots.Upon returning the thrust levers to idle, the vibration subsided and the popping stopped. The aircraft instrumentation then sounded two master caution alarms and the Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitoring (ECAM) system3 reported two messages for Engine No. 2 (right) STALL and EGT LIMIT EXCEEDANCE. The captain called for the cabin crew to move to stations.The cabin crew relayed to the flight crew that passengers had seen flames coming from the right engine. Both the airport tower controller and the flight crew of a following aircraft similarly reported seeing flames coming from the rear of the right engine for a short period of time. The tower dispatched Airport Rescue and Firefighting services, who observed no apparent abnormalities with the aircraft.The captain cancelled the flight and the aircraft was taxied back to the airport gate where both engines were shut down. Immediately after the passengers had disembarked, engineers reported finding small balls of metallic debris in the tailpipe of the right engine. A review of recorded data indicated the right engine had surged.A following tear down inspection revealed following damage:- The fan blades and LPC contained no visible damage.- The rear fairing to the LPC bleed valve mechanism was in place but had one Torq-set screw with a damaged head. Although of an incompatible shape, testing showed that due to the damage, the head would also accept a Phillips screwdriver tip.- In the HPC section, rotor blades (blades) and stators (vanes) in stages 3 and 4 contained dents and minor tears.- Approximately half of one stage 5 blade (Figure 5) and a whole stage 6 vane (Figure 6) were missing and had failed due to cyclic fatigue. Some of the remaining stage 5 blades exhibited tip curl, dents and/or missing material.- Four stage 7 blades and one stage 8 blade were missing and had failed due to overstress. In this section all remaining blades and vanes exhibited hard body damage resulting in severe bending and tearing to both leading and trailing edges. One stage 8 vane contained a distinctive hexagon shaped dent.- Damage after stage 8 was limited to minor dents and nicks with minimal damage occurring to the final stage components.- Bleed valve screens at stages 7 and 10 contained large amounts of metallic fragments.- Small metallic debris and a ¼ hexagon drive screwdriver tool bit (screwdriver tip) was found between the combustion liner and engine case. The screwdriver tip was burnt/discoloured and the tip eroded due to heat and mechanical damage.- Nozzle Guide Vane (NGV) cooling passages contained small metallic debris.- Two stage 1 HPT blades contained leading edge nicks attributed to material impacts.- Small debris was found throughout the LPT.The ATSB analysed:The damage to the HPC section and the screwdriver tip found in the cooling cavity were consistent with the screwdriver tip falling into the LPC bleed duct, passing through the interstage duct and into the HPC. The lack of damage to the LPC indicated the tip was not FOD from the runway. The damage to the rear fairing screw meant it was likely the screwdriver tip had been left in the screw or had fallen into the bleed duct during maintenance. At the next engine start-up, it then travelled through the HPC section striking various components, in some cases leaving witness marks, before being held captive adjacent to the combustion chamber.There was evidence that fatigue cracks initiated from the impact damage in a stage 5 blade and stage 6 vane. These cracks propagated until one reached a critical size due to aerodynamic forces and vibrations, and additionally for the blade, centripetal forces. As the engine surge event occurred during the application of take-off power and acceleration of the engine internal componentry, it is more likely the blade failed first due to the increase in centripetal acceleration.Regardless of whether the blade or vane failed first, one likely impacted the other and both then caused downstream damage, including the failure of a further five compressor blades. The resulting disruption to aerodynamic flow through the HPC allowed the engine to surge and led to the loss of engine performance.Metars:YBBN 230130Z 03013KT 9999 SCT030 BKN050 24/18 Q1015 NOSIG=YBBN 230100Z 03011KT 9999 SCT030 BKN070 25/18 Q1015 NOSIG=YBBN 230030Z 03011KT 9999 SCT030 26/17 Q1015 NOSIG=YBBN 230000Z 02011KT 9999 SCT030 26/17 Q1016 NOSIG=YBBN 222330Z 01009KT 9999 SCT025 25/18 Q1016=YBBN 222300Z 01007KT 9999 FEW025 SCT050 25/19 Q1016 NOSIG=YBBN 222230Z 01006KT 9999 FEW025 BKN050 23/19 Q1016 FM2300 02014KT 9999 SCT030=YBBN 222200Z 36005KT 9999 FEW020 BKN050 22/19 Q1016 FM2300 02014KT 9999 SCT030=YBBN 222130Z 03007KT 9999 FEW020 BKN050 23/19 Q1016 FM2300 02014KT 9999 SCT030=The damage screw driver tip (right hand), undamaged original (left) (Photos: ATSB):The blade damage (Photos: ATSB):

A Ryanair Boeing 737-800, registration EI-EFJ performing flight FR-2062 from Palma Mallorca,SP to Madrid,SP (Spain) with 152 passengers and 6 crew, was cleared for takeoff from Palma's runway 24R and was accelerating for takeoff. The driver of a maintenance vehicle, who had been cleared to enter the runway to perform maintenance work, was alerted by the radio traffic clearing the Boeing for takeoff, rushed to his vehicle and alerted tower of his presence. Tower cancelled the takeoff clearance, the Boeing crew rejected takeoff and vacated the runway.The aircraft was able to depart about 20 minutes later.Spain's CIAIAC reported the minimum distance between aircraft and vehicle was at least 1.6nm. There were no injuries and no damage. The CIAIAC is conducting an investigation. The US NTSB advised they have accredited a representative to join the investigation.On Jul 8th 2021 the CIAIAC released their final report concluding the probable cause of the incident was:The investigation has determined the runway incursion was caused by the local controllers (TWR) failure to adhere to the procedures set out in the units Operating Manual and the provisions of the Air Traffic Regulation in regard to the use of phraseology, active listening and surveillance of the airport manoeuvring area.Furthermore, the following factors are considered to have contributed:- The phraseology used by Balizamiento 3 driver when naming the runway he wanted to access, given that it was contrary to the stipulations in the LEPA Operating Manual because he failed to use the runway designator.- A spatial error made by the Balizamiento 3 vehicle driver in his first communication once established at H5, in that he requested entry to a runway he could not access from H5.The CIAIAC analysed:General considerationsOn 19 July 2020, the Boeing B737-800 aircraft with registration EI-EFJ, operated by Ryanair, was making a scheduled flight (callsign RYR81SN) from Palma de Mallorca Airport to Madrid-Barajas Adolfo Suárez Airport. Aircraft RYR81SN was instructed to taxi to the 24R holding point and then take off on runway 24R.The lighting vehicle, Balizamiento 3, was conducting a runway inspection from the threshold of runway 06L towards the threshold of runway 24R, having previously been cleared to do so.Both the vehicle and the aircraft were on the local controller frequency (TWR) when they found themselves on runway 06L/24R at the same time.The crew of the aircraft had the required licenses and medical certificates for the flight.The aircrafts documentation was in order.The driver of the lighting vehicle had the required licenses to carry out his work.The local controller (TWR) and the ground movement controller (GMC) had valid licenses, unit endorsements and medical certificates. Furthermore, their activity prior to the incident flight is considered to be compliant with normal standards.The meteorology at the time was in no way limiting and did not have any bearing on the incident.Cause of the conflictAt 20:48:53, preparations began for the integration of the ground movement position (GMC) with the local position (TWR) (the frequency unification and handover would occur at 20:50:12). Therefore, during the period between 20:48:53 and 20:50:12, the ground movement controller (GMC) should have made use of the checklists (according to the LEPA Operating Manual. Annex E: ATC handover checklist and Annex E: New control position checklist) and the electronic strips to prepare to close the ground movement control position (GMC), hand over the clearances, and unify both frequencies in the local position (TWR).If the handover had taken place according to the established procedures, the local controller (TWR) would have been made aware, at that point, of the location and intentions of the Balizamiento 3 vehicle.There is no documentary evidence to show that, during the handover, the outgoing ground movement controller (GMC) informed the local controller (TWR) that he had a vehicle circulating on the north taxiway or that he had made an electronic strip for the movement of that vehicle, as established in Annex B, section 5.3 of the LEPA Operating Manual and as recommended as a best practice in Appendix M of the EAPPRI 3.0 Plan. However, based on what happened next and the local controller's (TWR) own statement, its clear he was not aware of the exact position and intentions of the Balizamiento 3 vehicle.At 20:50:00, the driver of the Balizamiento 3 vehicle established initial contact on the local controller frequency (TWR), reported that he was at H5 and requested clearance to occupy the south runway. This communication was mistaken on two counts:- Firstly, because by not using the runway designator when making the occupancy request, he used a phraseology not in accordance with the provisions of the Basic Manual for the airport manoeuvring area EXA43 of AENA, section 4.1, and- Secondly, because his position at H5 meant the only runway he could access was the north, not the south. Therefore, the message from the driver of the lighting vehicle was incoherent from a spatial point of view because either the vehicle wasnt at H5, or it was, and he requested access to the north runway rather than the south. Upon hearing the contradictory message, the local controller (TWR) should have asked for some sort of clarification to ensure he understood the driver's intentions, but he didnt.Despite the phrasal and spatial errors in the communication, the local controller (TWR) replied, approved. This laconic response also failed to comply with the provisions of the LEPA Operational Manual by not using the designator of the runway for which the occupation permit was granted.His approval lead to the Balizamiento 3 vehicle entering runway 06L/24R through threshold 06L. Previously, at 20:47:08, the ground movement controller (GMC) had cleared the RYR81SN aircraft to taxi to the 24R holding point.The local controller (TWR) failed to visually identify the vehicle, as stipulated in section 4.5.1.3 of the RCA, claiming in his statement that he couldnt because it was night-time. Furthermore, he didnt use the A-SMGCS display to check its exact position. According to section 4.6.10.2.2.1 of the RCA, the SMR surface radar should be used to enhance the visual observation of traffic in the manoeuvring area and provide traffic surveillance in those parts of the manoeuvring area that cannot be observed visually.Had he carried out either of these two actions, he would have undoubtedly noticed the position of the Balizamiento 3 vehicle. According to the local controllers statement (TWR), he didnt carry out either of the two actions.At 20:50:10, the driver of the Balizamiento 3 vehicle requested the local controller (TWR), Can you switch off the stop bars at H5, please?. The controller responded: Balizamiento 3 go over the stop bars, to which the driver of the Balizamiento 3 vehicle responded, Copied, with permission to pass lit stop bars at H5, north runway occupied by Balizamiento 3, listening on frequency 118.3 . 118.305, sorry.There was no reply from the controller.Once again, this communication was erroneous for several reasons, and a decisive factor in the conflict that later occurred on the runway:- The driver's request to switch off the stop bars was in accordance with the provisions of the LEPA Operating Manual, which states that illuminated stop bars should not be exceeded. However, the controller instructed the Balizamiento 3 vehicle to pass the illuminated stop bars without any contingency circumstances, in a clear breach of the provisions of the LEPA Operating Manual.- In his acknowledgement, the driver of the Balizamiento 3 vehicle again failed to use the runway designator for the runway he was requesting permission to enter, although this time he said north runway, unlike the previous communication in which he said south runway. Now, at least, the driver's message was coherent from a spatial point of view because he stated he was entering the north runway from H5. However, the controller did not respond to the driver.- At this point (and as stated later by the local controller (TWR)), the controller thought the Balizamiento 3 vehicle was on the south runway and that he was authorising entry onto a non-operational runway. Despite the aforementioned spatial discrepancy between the two previous communications from the driver of the vehicle, the controller did not request any clarification. It follows, therefore, that his listening was not as active as it should have been because, although he was clear (mistakenly) that the vehicle was in the south zone, the driver had clearly said he was at H5 (which is in the north zone) and that he was entering the north runway.At 20:50:12, the ground movement controller (GMC) finished his shift and left. The local controller position (TWR) had already assumed the handover and integration of both frequencies, which included management of the surface movements at Palma de Mallorca Airport.At 20:50:43, the RYR81SN aircraft established initial contact on the Palma de Mallorca control tower local controller frequency (TWR) and indicated that it was ready to depart. The controller at the Palma de Mallorca control tower replied: RYR81SN good evening, wind 210º, 5 knots, runway 24R, cleared for take-off, traffic on final 8 miles out. The crew of the aircraft read-back the communication correctly.Resolution of the conflictThis take-off clearance should not have been issued because the runway was occupied by the Balizamiento 3 vehicle. It led to the inappropriate presence of the aircraft on the runway and the runway incursion that is the subject of this investigation. It should be noted that, at the time the clearance was given, the A-SMGCS screen already showed the Balizamiento 3 vehicle at the opposite end of runway 24R. Again, the controller failed to visually verify that the runway was clear and didnt use the A-SMGCS screen. If he had done so, he would have noticed the presence of the lighting vehicle on the runway on which he was authorising an aircraft to take off.The investigation has determined the runway incursion was caused by the local controllers (TWR) failure to adhere to the procedures set out in the units Operating Manual and the provisions of the Air Traffic Regulation in regard to the use of phraseology, active listening and surveillance of the airport manoeuvring area.At 20:51:32, the driver of the Balizamiento 3 vehicle, who was listening on the TWR frequency, heard the clearance given to the RYR81SN aircraft and notified the local controller, saying, Im on the north runway, you cleared me to enter, exiting immediately.At that moment, the Balizamiento 3 vehicle was abeam on level with the N7 taxiway and proceeded to vacate the runway via the H4 taxiway.At 20:51:37, the local controller (TWR) replied to the driver of the vehicle, Balizamiento 3, you told me you were on the south runway; vacate the runway immediately. Break, break .This last communication clearly demonstrates that the controller had mistakenly thought the lighting vehicle was on the south runway, under the impression that he had previously cleared it to enter the south runway, and not the north, despite the fact that the vehicle entered from H5, which is in the north zone of the airport.And at 20:51:39, the local controller (TWR) contacted the aircraft: RYR81SN hold position, I say again hold position. The crew of the aircraft acknowledged Stopping RYR81SN.According to section 1.4.12 g) of the RCA, this phraseology was also incorrect. Furthermore, the controller did not comply with the provisions of precept 4.5.5.4 of the aforementioned standard, which indicates that when a controller notifies an aircraft of a runway incursion after clearing it for take-off, they must inform the aircraft involved about the nature of the incursion and the position of the obstacle in relation to the runway. Something the controller failed to do.Finally, the driver of the Balizamiento 3 vehicle notified runway free via H4, and the controller asked aircraft RYR81SN if it could take off from its position abeam on taxiway N1. The crew responded negatively, advising that they would prefer to carry out some checks and return to holding point H1. Thus, the controller instructed the aircraft to leave the runway via N1 and advise when the runway was clear. Which it subsequently did.According to the radar data, the minimum distance reached between the aircraft and the vehicle was 1.6 NM at 20:51:49.Relevant factors in respect of the procedures/regulationsThe following factors are considered to have been relevant and decisive in producing the conflict:On the part of the driver of the Balizamiento 3 vehicle:- The phraseology he used to name the runway he wanted access to was not the phraseology stipulated in the Basic Manual for the airport manoeuvring area EXA43 of AENA, section 4.1because he did not use the runway designator.- A spatial error made in his first communication, once at H5, requesting access to the south runway (06R/24L), which he did not have access to from H5.On the part of the local controller (TWR):- Not detecting the inconsistency in the communication from the driver of Balizamiento 3 when he requested permission to enter the south runway (06R/24L), which he could not access from H5.- The phraseology he used to approve access to the requested runway was not the phraseology stipulated in the LEPA Operating Manual because he did not use the runway designator.- He did not perform a direct visual scanning of the position of the Balizamiento 3 vehicle, nor did he use the A-SMGCS display for the same purpose. Accordingly, he did not comply with the provisions of sections 4.5.1.3 and 4.6.10.2.2.1 of the RCA.- He should not have instructed the Balizamiento 3 vehicle to pass the illuminated stop bars without any contingency circumstances to justify the action and, therefore, did not comply with the stipulations in the LEPA Operating Manual.- The phraseology he used with the aircraft after warning it of the runway incursion was incorrect, according to section 1.4.12 g) of the RCA.- He did not comply with the provisions of precept 4.5.5.4 of the RCA, which indicates that when a controller notifies an aircraft of a runway incursion after clearing it for take-off, they must inform the aircraft involved about the nature of the incursion and the position of the obstacle in relation to the runway.
A TUI Nederland Airlines Boeing 737-8 MAX, registration PH-TFN performing flight OR-607 from Groningen (Netherlands) to Las Palmas,CI (Spain), had lined up runway 23 and was cleared for takeoff, when the crew waited and advised ATC they needed two more minutes due to weather ahead. The crew finally commenced takeoff from runway 23 but rejected takeoff at low speed (about 78 knots over ground) after receiving a wind shear alert. The crew advised they wanted to return to the holding point.

A Silk Way Boeing 747-400 freighter, registration VP-BCV performing flight 7L-648 from Hong Kong (China) to Baku (Azerbaijan), was accelerating for takeoff from Hong Kong's runway 25L when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed due to the failure of the #3 engine (PW4056, inboard right hand). The aircraft slowed, vacated the runway at the last exit (past the runway end) and became disabled clear of the runway when 12 main gear tyres deflated as result of the rejected takeoff.The aircraft seen at the taxiway:The deflated tyres:The engine:
A Qatar Airways Airbus A350-1000, registration A7-ANF performing flight QR-707 from Doha (Qatar) to Washington Dulles,DC (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Doha's runway 34L when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (above 100 KIAS) due to an EGT overtemperature indication for the left hand engine (Trent XWB). The aircraft slowed safely but got stuck on the runway about 2540 meters/8330 feet down the runway due to a number of tyres deflating. Qatar's AIB reported the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (greater than 100 KIAS) due to a "ENG 1 EGT OVER LIMIT" ECAM message. The aircraft slowed safely but 6 right hand and 4 left hand tyres deflated. The occurrence was rated a serious incident and is being investigated.
A UTAir Avions de Transport Regional ATR-72-212A, registration VQ-BLJ performing flight UT-294 from Sochi to Krasnodar (Russia), was accelerating for takeoff from runway 24 when the crew rejected takeoff due to a low oil pressure indication.

Emergency services responded, no trace of fire, heat or smoke was detected.The aircraft returned to the threshold runway 32 about 25 minutes later and attempted another takeoff but again needed to reject takeoff at low speed (50 knots over ground) due to a crew rest area smoke indication. The aircraft returned to the apron.The flight was cancelled.
A Kin Avia Let L-410, registration 9S-GRJ performing a flight from Bukavu to Shabunda (DR Congo) with 1 passenger and 2 crew and 1.6 tons of sheet metal, crashed about 30 seconds after takeoff from Kavumu Aerodrome at about 11:15L (09:15Z). All 3 occupents perished in the crash, the aircraft has been destroyed.In the evening DR Congo's Ministry of Transport released a statement reporting 9S-GRJ departed Bukavu with 3 occupants and 1.6 tons of cargo, about 3 minutes after takeoff at about 11:15L the aircraft began eviating from its initial trajectory and impacted ground. An investigation is being set up.On Jun 17th 2021 the airline reported the aircraft 9S-GRJ (MSN 872006) was involved in the crash. The aircraft carried 1500kg of iron roof sheeting, the aircraft departed runway 17. Preliminary information suggests a load shift caused the aircraft to pitch up less than 30 seconds after takeoff and to enter a full aerodynamic stall. The aircraft reached a maximum height of about 300 feet, the left wing dropped, the aircraft turned left and came to rest in a valley just behind the UN Monusco installation of Bukavu Kavumu Airport.On Jun 24th 2021 DR Congo's BPEA reported: "The plane failed to take off from Kavumu airfield." and confirmed 3 fatalities as result of the crash. The crash is being investigated.The airline states on their website they operate 5 L-410 (tail numbers 9S-CMA (previous 9Q-CMA), 9S-GEN, 9S-GKA, 9S-GRJ, no further tails listed), a Dash 8-100 (tail number C-FASC) and a Beech 1900 (N191CS).The wreckage:Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):
A SATA International Airbus A320-200, registration CS-TKJ performing flight S4-680 from Funchal (Portugal) to Copenhagen (Denmark) with 105 passengers and 7 crew, just rotated for takeoff from runway 05 when the airplane went through a flock of sea gulls causing a number of birds being ingested into both engines (CFM56) causing both engines to vibrate and a number of sea gulls hitting wings, fuselage and landing gear causing the forward cargo door to open. The aircraft climbed out safely and returned to Funchal for a safe landing on runway 05 about 15 minutes after departure.The airport reported the birds were sitting on the runway despite ultrasound equipment to scare the birds away and flew up when the aircraft went through the flock.A replacement Airbus A320-200 is currently estimated to reach Copenhagen with a delay of 5:15 hours.Both engines suffered a number of damaged fan blades but received no downstream damage. Both fans needed replacement of almost half the number of fan blades.Portugal's GPIAA reported that both engines suffered high amplitude vibrations however without significant loss of power. The airplane climbed to safety altitude and immediately returned for a safe overweight landing. During roll out the forward cargo door was observed open confirmed by cockpit indications. Blood traces were found on various parts of the aircraft, a number of fan blades of both engines were damaged, borescopic inspections revealed no damage in the compressors, combustion chambers or turbines.Aviation sources reported at least one sea gull hit the door handle of the forward cargo door and rotated the handle into the open position causing the forward cargo door to open.On Jun 22nd 2021 Portugal's GPIAAF released their final summary report releasing following conclusions and comments into the serious incident were:Traces of blood at multiple points along the lower fuselage, wings and landing gear as well as the finding of several seagull carcasses on the runway allows the investigation to conclude that the aircraft encountered a flock of seagulls during the take-off run, some of which struck the fuselage and were ingested in the engines.One of the birds directly struck the forward cargo door handle flap, penetrating the recess and forcing the handle out.In 2009, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) published a study on bird population trends and their impact on aviation safety, covering a period from 1999 to 2008.The study assessed the location on the aircraft where damage was sustained as a result of the bird strike and determined that in 44% of cases the engines were affected, by far the most frequent part of the aircraft. The wing, windshield and nose of the aircraft followed with 31%, 13% and 8% respectively.The least frequent location of the aircraft to get struck by birds was the fuselage which occurred in just 4% of the events included in the study.Yet, even the most improbable occurrences can in time manifest themselves as was the case of a bird striking a rapidly moving aircraft directly on the forward cargo door handle flap, which has a total surface area of 66 cm2.The analysis conducted of the door handle demonstrated that once exposed to the air flow, the aerodynamic drag force is sufficient to overcome the cargo door locking mechanism, and ultimately result in the unlatching of the door, as was the case in the event.Despite the damage sustained by the fan, the engines continued to operate with negligible loss of thrust. The fan blades remained operational and there was no separation despite the intense vibration. The intense vibration caused the crew concern about the imminent failure of one or both engines. As such, the crews decision to land immediately was the safest course of action given the circumstances, despite manoeuvring at low altitude over the sea and only becoming aware that the door was open, once they were already on the ground. Being a native of Madeira and a seasoned pilot with over 9000 landings at Funchal probably contributed towards the Captains decision and swift actions to return to the airport, in little over 3 minutes after getting airborne.Bird strikes have been a hazard since the early days of aviation. Orville Wright, one of the famous Wright brothers, is reported to have experienced a bird strike in the spring of 1905 when he was conducting an experimental flight over a field in Ohio.On the 29th of January 2012, the crew of an Air France A319 were on final approach to Algiers when at about 100ft the crew hear a thud followed by a change to the aerodynamic noise. During rollout, at approximately 80kts, they received the DOOR FWD CARGO ECAM alert and when they reached the stand, the forward cargo door handle was found to have shifted outside of its recess, in an unlocked position. The vent flap was also partially open but the cargo door itself remained flush with the fuselage, in a latched condition.Similar to the event in Funchal, the bird strike in Algiers left traces of blood immediately aft and within the handle recess. However, in this event the movement of the handle was not sufficient to unlatch the door. The fact that it occurred at the final moments of the flight, with the aircraft already in a lower energy state, may explain the different outcome to the SATA event in Funchal. Although it is impossible to entirely eliminate thethreat posed by bird strikes, several mitigating measures can be taken to reduce the concentration of birds in the vicinity of aerodromes and repel them from the movement areas.While much of these measures were already in place at Madeira airport at the time of the event, they were insufficient to prevent a large flock of seagulls from striking the aircraft during the takeoff roll.Bird strikes, like other operational flight safety hazards need to be the subject of continuous monitoring, review and risk mitigation within the aerodromes safety management system similar to the operators own risk assessment of the hazards of a particular type of operation or aerodrome.The GPIAAF described the sequence of events:The aircraft taxied to runway 05 for take-off and accelerated normally. As it approached rotation speed, about two-thirds down the runway, the aircraft encountered a large flock of seagulls which were perched on the runway surface, at 08:21:50 UTC. As the birds sprung into the air, they struck the aircraft as it was getting airborne, hitting the landing gear, flaps and the lower surfaces of the fuselage and wings.Some of the birds were ingested into both engines resulting in intense vibration which was felt throughout the aircraft.The N1 vibration readings displayed on the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) Engine page were flashing and had reached their maximum value.At 08:22:16 UTC the crew declared mayday and warned the air traffic controller of the possibility of failure of both engines, requesting to return immediately to the airport.The crew performed a climbing turn to the right and at approximately 900ft (08:22:21 UTC) reduced power on the engines in order to attempt to diminish the vibrations. The aircraft began descending and lost 150ft. At 08:23:07 UTC, the crew requested to land immediately, which was acknowledged by ATC.Power was re-applied and the aircraft climbed to approximately 1000ft (08:23:30 UTC) before descending on a right-hand circuit to approach and land on runway 05, maintaining an average airspeed of 150kts.Despite the vibrations, the engines continued to operate normally and any reduction of thrust was negligible.The landing gear was initially retracted after takeoff but extended a few seconds later after the decision to land immediately. The flaps/slats configuration remained unchanged since take-off.The aircraft performed a safe overweight landing on runway 05 at 08:25:06 UTC, in just over 3 minutes since taking-off and suffering the multiple bird strike.During the landing-roll, as the aircraft decelerated below 80kts, the crew received the DOOR FWD CARGO master caution message on the ECAMS engine/warning display (E/WD) and the DOOR page automatically appeared on the ECAMs system display, showing the forward cargo door symbol and indication in amber (08:25:21 UTC).Soon thereafter, the tower also informed the crew that the forward cargo door was open, while the aircraft was taxiing to the stand.An aviation enthusiast and photographer positioned in close proximity to the threshold of runway 05, photographed the aircraft as it taxied into position for take-off and subsequently when it returned to land on runway 05. The photos he took of the latter stages of the flight show that the forward cargo door was indeed open.The GPIAAF described the damage:Although with no apparent damage, upon arrival on stand, ground support staff found the forward cargo door swung open and the handle in its fully unlocked position.No injuries were reported among the 105 passengers and 7 crew members who were onboard the aircraft.The carcasses of several seagulls were recovered from the runway when it was inspected.Traces of blood were observed at multiple points along the lower fuselage, belly fairing and the lower inboard surfaces of the wings, left-hand inboard flap and left-hand main landing gear strut and door.Examination of the forward cargo door revealed pronounced blood smear on the surface skin just aft of the handle flap. There was also evidence of blood inside the handle recess, within the door structure. There was no visible damage to the door and no luggage items had ejected the cargo hold. Engine intake lip and cowlings showed no visible damage or impact marks, but the inner liner had substantial blood smear and tip curl deformation was observed on 9 fan blades on engine number 2 and 12 fan blades on engine number 1. The damage to the fan blades was out of operating limits and these had to be replaced. Boroscopic inspection performed on both engines did not reveal any further damage.A heavy weight landing inspection was performed but did not find any damage to the aircraft.The GPIAAF reported that the former GPIAA had rated the occurrence a serious incident and had opened an investigation, however, due to lack of funding was unable to proceed with the investigation. After the creation of the GPIAAF in 2017 an action plan could be established to conclude the investigation. The safety report was closed with this summary report.The report spends a whole lot analysing the cargo door opening stating, it was the only one known at the time and thus is considered an isolated event. The chances of a bird directly hitting the cargo door handle were computed as extremely improbable. Airbus regarded the event as a "major" one, however stated, had it occurred at a higher cabin pressure it likely could have become "catastrophic". However, had the aircraft been pressurized, the force to move the handle would have been larger than the force needed to rupture the mechanism. In an unpressurized aircraft however simulations and computations showed that it was possible the handle was moved by an impact and aerodynamic forces by airflow around could have further moved the handle into the open position. 
A Lufthansa Airbus A320-200, registration D-AIWF performing flight LH-1749 from Rhodes (Greece) to Munich (Germany), was accelerating for takeoff from Rhodes' runway 25 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 120 knots over ground). The aircraft slowed safely and stopped on the runway. Emergency services responded. A ground observer reported the A320 had stopped on runway 25 about abeam taxiway C with speedbrakes extended, fire engines in attendance. A short time later the aircraft taxied to the apron, where a number of people including one of the pilots looked after the right hand engine (CFM56). A runway inspection was conducted, stopped about 1200 feet down the runway and checked the location carefully. The people at the aircraft now also looked into the left hand engine, opened the gear doors and checked the gear.The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground for about 2:20 hours after the rejected takeoff, then departed and reached Munich with a delay of 2 hours.
A Condor Airbus A320-200, registration D-AICE performing flight DE-1606 from Munich (Germany) to Mikonos (Greece), was accelerating for takeoff from Munich's runway 08L when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 100 knots) due the airspeed indications disagreeing with each other. The aircraft slowed safely, vacated the runway via high speed exit A5 about 1300 meters/4350 feet down the runway and returned to the apron.A replacement Airbus A321-200 registration D-ATCF positioned from Frankfurt/Main (Germany) to Munich and reached Mikonos with a delay of about 4 hours.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Munich about 29 hours after the rejected takeoff. It had flown a good number of sectors during June 2021 and had been on the ground in Munich for about 31 hours prior to the rejected takeoff.
A TAROM Avions de Transport Regional ATR-72-212A, registration YR-ATI performing flight RO-717 from Bucharest Otopeni to Iasi (Romania) with 34 passengers and 4 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Otopeni Airport's runway 08L when strong vibrations originating from the landing gear prompted the crew to reject takeoff at high speed. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.A replacement ATR-42-500 registration YR-ATA reached Iasi with a delay of 4 hours.Romania's CIAS have opened an investigation, a team investigators had been dispatched on site.On Oct 20th 2016 the CIAS reported that a runway inspection found pieces of runway lights on the runway, the pieces were identfied as parts of runway edge lights, a number of runway edge lights from the southern edge of the runway were completely missing.On Jun 18th 2021 the CIAS released their final report concluding the probable cause of the serious incident was:The cause which led to the serious incident is the aircraft alignment and its take-off roll performed along the runway edge lights line of the R/H edge of the runway.Favoring causes:- The lack of crew concentration during this flight phase;- Distraction of crews attention during this flight phase;- The aircraft did not follow the yellow line marking the centerline of the W taxiway until the intersection with the runway centerline.The CIAS reported:The aircraft started the takeoff roll but, few moments later, the crew rejected the takeoff, the reason given to the control tower being the sensing of vibrations at the nose gear.After stopping the takeoff, the aircraft vacated the runway on taxiway O, continued on taxiways P and C then returned on the apron, at the parking spot.After the runway was declared vacated, another aircraft, registration YR-ASB, was given the clearance for lineup and hold, by informing them to wait for a runway inspection.An employee of the airport did perform a runway inspection, using an airport service car. The path followed by this car, was: entry on the runway by the taxiway V, towards the 08L threshold, then along the north side of the runway and turning in front of the aircraft which was aligned for takeoff, continuing on the south side until the intersection with the taxiway V, after that following a path on the runway centerline and then runway was vacated at its end, on the taxiway O. During this runway control, nothing unusual was noticed.After this control, three other commercial flights took off on runway 08L.The airport personnel in duty, requested a control of the YR-ATI aircraftat the parking position. It was found that the ventral fuselage, behind the nose gear, presented few deformations following hits, some of them with skin punctured and also, at least three blades of the left-hand engine, presented hits scars.As a consequence of the findings on the aircraft, a thorough inspection of the 08L runway was performed and there been found metallic elements and glass cullet which were identified as broken parts of the runway edge lights. It was found that six runway edge lights were destroyed (numbers 3, 4, 5 ,6, 14 and 16), all of them on the south edge of the 08L runway.Following these findings, the 08L/26R runway was closed.The aircraft was flown by a captain (32, ATPL, 4,723 hours total) and a first officer (31, ATPL, 1,488 hours total). At the time of the occurrence following METAR was valid:LROP 131830Z 11005KT CAVOK 08/07 Q1019 NOSIG=The CIAS analysed:According to the records analyzed by the investigation commission, the time framing of the events was the as follows:- At 21:06 LT (18:06 UTC), the crew requests clearance for engines start-up, from OTP GND (Ground Otopeni);- After engines start-up, at 21:08 LT, the crew requests taxi clearance, which was performed maintaining a radio communication with cu OTP GND;- During its taxi along O taxiway, when was approaching from the intersection with W taxiway, the crew entered in radio contact OTP TWR (Otopeni Tower) and was cleared to enter, line-up and hold on 08L runway.- For the entrance on the runway and line-up, initially the pilot followed the yellow centerline of the W taxiway/, which leads to the runway centerline. At the moment of entering the runway, she turned to the left, leaving this marking.- After this maneuver, she turned to the right and aligned on the line of right runway edge light considering that is the runway centerlineAfter lineup, the crew continued with the cockpit checks, according to the FCOM ATR72 Normal Procedures Cap 2.03 Before Take Off. OTP TWR issued the clearance for take-off.After receiving the takeoff clearance, the crew requested a delay of 30 seconds for take-off, in order to gain a timely and spatial separation behind an aircraft which just took-off. The aircraft started the take-off roll and after approximate 700 m, at an indicated speed of 82 kt, the take-off was rejected, the reason given by the crew being the appearance of some vibrations at the nose wheel:18:16:44 ROT717: ROT717 stopping; CTA TWR: Roger ROT717. Do you need any assistance on the runway? ROT717: Negative CTA TWR: Roger ROT717, if able vacate via taxiway Oscar ROT717: Will vacate via Oscar18:17:45 CTA TWR: ROT717 can you please tell me the reason? ROT717: Vibrations at the nose wheel.After rejecting take-off, the aircraft vacated the 08L runway on O taxiway, then it followed the taxiways P and C and returned to the parking position....According to the CVR (Cockpit Voice Recorder) records the followingaspects can be evidenced:- during the whole period, since engines start-up, taxi, aircraft line-up on runway for takeoff and until the moment of starting the takeoff roll, inside the flight deck were recorded talks which were irrelevant for the flight (critical phase).- after the lineup clearance on 08L runway was obtained, the flight deck crew passed to the cabin crew, the specific message to take their positions for takeoff: Cabin crew take your seat for Take Off.- after 37 seconds since this message was given, a flight attendant entered the cockpit and an irrelevant talk for the flight phase took place.The path followed by the YR-ATI aircraft, from its parking position until the runway vacation after rejecting takeoff on 08L, according to the GPS data analyzed by the investigation commission, reveals the maneuver executed for runway line-up and the aircraft alignment on the runway edge line of the R/H edge of the runway. ...This data has been compared to and validated by the records of the radarA-SMGCS system and have been used to create a real movie of the events....The radar surveillance system is used by the ground traffic controller, which has no responsibilities regarding checking the aircraft position on the runway and also, is not anymore in radio communication with the crew when the aircraft is on the runway, aligned for takeoff and waiting for its takeoff clearance.As a consequence, the responsibility for the maneuvers of runway entering and alignment for takeoff are lying only with the flight deck crew.Out of the analyzed images can be revealed that the aircraft did not perform a correct line-up on the runway centerline and the take-off roll, until its rejection, was been executed completely along the runway edge lights line of the R/H runway edge. ...Also, the investigation commission considers that two more contributivefactors for the analyzed occurrence can be evidenced:- failing to use all the means and resources to obtain a positive confirmation of the aircraft position, such as a cross-check done by the copilot of the visual references (first officer & captain of the visual references (the runway centerline beacon and the two runway edges light lines) and the onboard navigation means (check according to FCOM FD BAR CENTERED, HDG=RWY HDG).- crew behavior, which was conducted by the routine and their actions were not according to CRM (Crew Resource Management).CRM is a principle of team work for the flight crews, actually referring to the optimal management of all the onboard resources, offered by: the onboard technology, the flight crew, navigation means, air traffic controllers, etc.CRM is a concept by which is intending to mitigate the errors and to increase the efficiency of the flight crews and can be defined as the efficient use by the crew, of all the available resources (information, material equipment and human resources) to achieve an efficient and safe flight operation.According to CRM, the duties of each pilot are clearly defined for each flight phase.The copilot declared that she kept all the time her eyes within the cockpit, despite the 30 seconds supplementary waiting before starting the takeoff roll. The copilot did not continuously monitor the maneuvers during aircraft taxi, and neither monitors the space around, and the pilot in command, probably due to routine, performed incorrectly a critical phase of flight, respectively, the lineup on the runway for takeoff. More of that, the crews attention was being distracted by irrelevant talks.Analyzing the records of the A-SMGCS system can be noticed the moment when the aircraft returns on the runway centerline, then continues taxiing until the O taxiway. It can be considered that the crew acknowledged that the takeoff roll was wrongly performed along the runway edge lights of the R/H side.According to the opinion of the investigation commission, the pilot in command should report to the air traffic controller the real reason for the takeoff rejection, in order to prevent the exposure of the next operating aircraft on the same runway to the high risk represented by the debris of the destroyed beacons remained on the runway (FOD).The investigation commission considers also that neither the last safety filter which should of prevent that other three aircraft to takeoff from a FOD contaminated runway, did not work. That is the first runway inspection performed by the airport designated personnel.

The aircraft received substantial damage, the occurrence was rated an accident and is being investigated by Mexico's AIB.On May 28th 2021 Germany's BFU announced in their March Bulletin, that they supported the investigation by Mexico's AIB following the fracture of the nose gear because one of the components was designed/manufactured in Germany.Related NOTAMs:A1306/21 NOTAMR A1305/21Q) MMFR/QMRLC/IV/NBO/A/000/999/2041N10515W A) MMPR B) 2103182023 C) 2103182200E) RWY 22 BTN THR RWY 22 AND TWY G CLSDA1305/21 NOTAMNQ) MMFR/QMRLC/IV/NBO/A/000/999/2041N10515W002 A) MMPR B) 2103182007 C) 2103182200E) THR RWY 22 BTN TWY A AND TWY G CLSDMetars:MMPR 182049Z 20011KT 15SM SKC 23/16 A2992 RMK SLP129 57014 911=MMPR 181943Z 21012KT 15SM SKC 23/17 A2995=MMPR 181844Z 21010KT 15SM SKC 23/16 A2996=MMPR 181743Z 22008KT 15SM SKC 23/13 A2997 RMK SLP146 52001 911=MMPR 181643Z 19007KT 15SM SKC 23/11 A2997=MMPR 181542Z 00000KT 15SM SKC 21/12 A2997=The remainder of the nose gear strut and damage to runway:Some lonesome wheels:The aircraft on its nose:
A North Cariboo Air de Havilland Dash 8-300, registration C-FHNC performing flight NCB-4051 from Kirby Lake,AB to Edmonton,AB (Canada) with 29 passengers and 3 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Kirby Lake, flaps set at 15 degrees, when at 95 KIAS the crew attempted to rotate the aircraft but felt an abnormally heavy elevator control and rejected takeoff. The aircraft slowed safely and came to a stop on the runway.The Canadian TSB reported the crew subsequently vacated the runway and tested the flight controls and found the elevator travel heavy during the first third of travel, then becoming normal. The crew configured the aircraft for another takeoff, applied more force during the takeoff rotation and completed the flight to Edmonton.Company maintenance subsequently visually inspected elevators, elevator tabs and horizontal stabilizers and performed an operational test of the elevator control system with no anomalies found. The examination concluded the heavy feel on the elevator was the result of the near full forward CG and the specific flap configuration.

A Singapore Boeing 777-300, registration 9V-SWD performing flight SQ-825 from Shanghai Pudong (China) to Singapore (Singapore) with 120 people on board, departed Pudong's runway 35R at 00:35L (17:35Z Sep 1st), after takeoff the autopilot was engaged. Climbing through about 360 feet AGL the GPWS sounded "DON'T SINK!" three times. The crew performed throubleshooting and changed the pitch mode, however another "DON'T SINK" follwed by a "TERRAIN! TERRAIN! PULL UP!" GPWS alert occurred. The crew disengaged the autopilot, increased thrust and pitch, the warnings ceased and the aircraft climbed to safety and continued to destination for a safe landing.On Sep 5th 2020 Singapore's Transportation Safety Investigation Board (TSIB) reported the occurrence was rated an incident and is being investigated by the TSIB. The final investigation report is already being drafted.On Apr 20th 2021 the TSIB released their final report concluding the probable causes of the incident were:- The EGPWS DONT SINK events encountered by the flight crew were the result of the FMC having registered a speed/altitude constraint of 250/500 for the waypoint PD062. The PIC had inadvertently keyed in 250/0500 instead of the intended 250/0500A.- As to the activation of the EGPWS PULL UP warning alert, the investigation team was unable to determine the reason of the activation. However, the aircraft manufacturer suspected that the warning could be as a result of the combination of the low radio altitude, descent rate and flight path angle required to capture the 500 feet altitude constraint that had been entered into the FMC. The PIC did not identify that there was an abnormal condition with the auto-flight system despite the series of DONT SINK alerts over a period of relatively short time.- This occurrence also revealed many instances where the flight crew did not comply with the operators standard operating procedures, where the flight crew lost situational and flight mode awareness, and where the flight crews crew resource management performance in terms of communication had not been optimal.- The PIC had to deal with a number of issues prior to the departure. Each of these issues, by itself, would have been just a minor issue for the PIC. However, together, these out-of-the-normal pre-flight circumstances might have perturbed the PIC. The extent of any perturbation could not be ascertained, and the investigation team could only suspect that they could have added up to some significant stress on the PIC and contributed to his lapses in FMC programming and decision-making during the flight.- Notwithstanding that the PICs training and assessment record did not indicate any issues in the area of auto-flight management, there might be room for improvement on the part of the operator to ensure that its auto-flight management assessment programme is robust.The TSIB reported the captain (55, ATPL, 18,370 hours total, 11,085 hours on type) was pilot flying, the first officer (29, CPL, 1,744 hours total, 1,744 hours on type) was pilot monitoring.The TSIB reported that prior to departure the crew had to go through a number of issues, which were related to weather as well as to five MEL items, one of which reference the right hand engine's inoperative pneumatic manifold temperature sensor, which caused the high pressure shut off valve to be locked into the closed position and was particularly difficult as it required reference to five more MEL items. The crew subsequently experienced difficulties with their CPDLC communication which worked only intermittent. After receiving their operational flight plan indicating departure from runway 34L and SID HSN 22X the captain tried to download the route into the FMC but had trouble to do so, hence decided to manually input the route into the RTE1. He noticed that the first waypoint of the route was "HSH 250/1970A" with a constraint of not more than 250 KIAS and 1970A feet (at or alove 1970 feet indicated by the trailing A). The first officer returned from his walk around, the crew engaged in a detailed briefing of the MEL items. The first officer finally managed to download the pre-departure clearance via CPDLC, the crew noticed that instead of runway 34L they were now assigned runway 35R with the SID HSN 12X. Thus the captain needed to amend his former inputs and chose to use the FMC's ROUTE COPY function to copy the former RTE1 route into RTE2 and amended RTE2 to HSN 12X. The crew then briefed the departure, the captain noticed that the FMS was showing waypoint PD062 as first waypoint without any constraints (PD062 ---/----). Although the captain was aware that this was not abnormal, he preferred to have the speed contraint in place. Hence he keyed the speed and altitude constraint in as "250/0500" (erroneously omitting the trailing A indicating at or above 500 feet). After verifying the route the captain was satisfied with the route and activated the route.After the FMC had been prepared the first officer had further questions regarding the MEL items and the captain spent some more time to explain his plan and the action needed to be taken. Ground staff, concerned the flight could be further delayed, came on board querying when they could close the aircraft doors, the captain sent them off the aircraft advising the crew would tell them when the doors could be closed. The crew needed to convert China's metric altitudes into feet using the tables. The captain intended to engage the autopilot early in order to reduce workload, however, the first officer later stated he did not recall the captain communicating this plan.During taxi the crew again reviewed the MEL items, lined up runway 35R. During acceleration for takeoff the needed MEL actions were smoothly taken, the aircraft became airborne, the gear was retracted and the captain called for A/P engagement while the aircraft was climbing through 360 feet AGL. The first officer activated the autopilot. Climbing through 400 feet the AP announciators changed to SPEED/LNAV/VNAV PTH, the first officer called the announciators out twice with no response from the captain, the captain later stated he did not recall hearing the call outs.The aircraft climbed past 500 feet AGL, the speed trend indicated increasing speed, believing the aircraft had already climbed above 1000 feet AGL the captain called for the flaps to be retracted. However, according to the QAR the aircraft did not reach 1000 feet AGL, it climbed to a maximum of 750 feet AGL, then descended back to 500 feet AGL consistent with the altitude constraint for waypoint PD062 the captain had keyed into the FMC. The captain did not recognize the aircraft had stopped climbing and was descending towards 500 feet AGL.During the initial stages of the flap retraction the EGPWS issued a "DON'T SINK!" caution startling both captain and first officer who did not expect such a caution in this stage of the flight. The captain intended to not rush and first complete the flaps retraction as he deemed the flight stable. 9 seconds after the first call the EGPWS again issued a "DON'T SINK" caution, the flaps were still retracting, and another 9 seconds later the EGPWS issued a third "DON'T SINK". Only at this point the crew recognized the aircraft had levelled off and they needed to re-initiate a climb. The captain engaged Flight Level Change on the Mode Control Panel, however, returned to VNAV 2 seconds later. The aircraft thus continued to remain at 500 feet AGL. A fourth "DON'T SINK" caution was issued by the EGPWS followed shortly by a "PULL UP" warning. In response the captain disengaged the autopilot, pushed the thrust levers forward and manually pitched the aircraft up, the warning ceased.Climbing through 1600 feet AGL the captain re-engaged the autopilot, the MCP had not been reset and VNAV PTH was still active, the aircraft pitched down to descend to 500 feet again. The TSIB wrote: "At this time the FO noticed on his ND that there was a 250/0500 speed/altitude constraint set for the waypoint PD062. He realised that it was this altitude constraint that had been causing the aircraft to attempt to maintain 500 feet when VNAV was engaged. The FO alerted the PIC that they needed to cancel the speed/altitude constraint and the FO pushed the altitude selector button on the MCP to delete the programmed speed/altitude constraint. After doing so, there was no more issue with the aircraft climbing to the intended altitude and the flight proceeded to Singapore without further incident."The TSIB analysed:It was clear that the events encountered by the flight crew were the result of the FMC having registered a speed/altitude constraint of 250/0500 for the waypoint PD062. The PIC had inadvertently keyed in 250/0500 instead of the intended 250/0500A. This meant that, when the armed VNAV mode became active at 400 feet AGL, it would provide guidance commands to the A/P to maintain the programmed altitude of 500 feet. Given the high rate of climb and aircraft inertia, it was not possible for the auto-flight system to immediately capture 500 feet. Hence the aircraft climbed through this altitude before commencing a descent in an attempt to maintain the programmed altitude until PD062....There were a number of instances in this occurrence where the flight crew did not comply with the operators SOPs:- Before the departure runway was assigned and while the FO was not in the flight deck, the PIC manually set up RTE 1 on LEGS page in the FMC based on the hardcopy of OFP they received. This practice was not in accordance with the operators SOP whereby manual OFP entries into the FMC were to be made by both the flight crew together as cross-checking was required.- After ascertaining the departure runway from the PDC, the PIC copied RTE 1 to RTE 2 and then changed the runway and SID to Runway 35R and SID HSN 12X respectively, but he did not select ACTIVATE after doing so and started briefing the FO on the flight route. During the briefing, he noticed that the speed/altitude constraint for waypoint PD062 displayed only as ---/-----" and proceeded to manually enter the constraints. After briefing the FO regarding the flight route, the PIC then pressed ACTIVATE and executed RTE 2 into the FMC. This was not in accordance with the procedure where the route should have been activated prior to selecting the SID (see Footnote 7). Had RTE 2 been activated prior to selecting the SID, the FMC would have automatically displayed the predicted speed and altitude of all the waypoints when the SID was selected. When the PIC did not follow the steps in the procedure, the PD062 waypoint was presented as ---/-----, which led the PIC to manually enter the speed/altitude constraints for PD062. The manual entry would take precedence over FMCs predicted speed and altitude.- When the aircraft was climbing past 400 feet AGL after take-off, the FO observed the VNAV engagement on the FMA and announced SPEED / VNAV PTH twice. However, the PIC did not acknowledge the FOs callouts as he did not hear them. The FO did not challenge the PIC to acknowledge his callout as required by the procedure. - In response to the EGPWS PULL UP warning alert, the PIC disconnected the A/P and manually increased the engine thrust and pitched the aircraft up into a climb at 15 degrees. While the PIC had carried out the recovery manoeuvre in a timely manner, he did not adhere fully to the EGPWS escape manoeuvre by disengaging the auto-throttle and pitching the aircraft to 20 degrees as required. The investigation team was unable to determine the reason of the activation of the EGPWS PULL UP warning alert. However, the aircraft manufacturer suspected that the warning could be as a result of the combination of the low radio altitude, descent rate and flight path angle required to capture the 500 feet altitude constraint that had been entered into the FMC. The investigation team noted that that there was no maintenance record of any defect relating to the EGPWS before the incident and there had been no report of any problem with the EGPWS following the incident....There were a number of instances in this occurrence where the flight crews performance in terms of CRM had not been optimal:- The FOs own experience was that it was not necessary for the PIC to input the speed constraint in respect of PD062 on SID HSN 12X when the FMC displayed a speed/altitude constraint of ---/-----. However, he did not raise any query with the PIC on the need to do so. Also, while he observed the PICs input of the speed/altitude constraint, he did not notice that the PIC had keyed in 0500 instead of 0500A.- The PIC planned to engage the A/P early after take-off in order to use the auto-flight system to reduce the workload in managing the flight and had informed the FO. However, the FO did not recall that the PIC communicated his plan to engage the A/P early.- With respect to the first DONT SINK caution alert, the PIC thought that it could be due to a tailwind. The FO did not think so and was more inclined to believe that it had something to do with the VNAV PTH flight mode. However, the FO did not challenge the PIC.- Following ATCs clearance for the aircraft to climb to 6,000 metres AGL (19,700 feet), the FO called out 197 and saw the PIC set a different altitude figure on the MCP. The FO did not hear the PICs callout for the altitude that the PIC set although he heard the PIC mutter something unintelligible. The FO then repeated the callout two more times, but the PIC did not respond to him and the FO did not pursue the matter further with the PIC. (See paragraph 1.7.1 (a)) The PICs intention of starting the aircraft to climb by setting an intermediate altitude followed by the final setting of 197 was not communicated to the FO.The investigation team opined that the FO was not assertive in eliciting the PICs response to his callouts or in questioning the PIC when he had doubts about the PICs actions. The investigation team felt that the FO should have applied the escalation technique taught in CRM training to alert the PIC of the FOs concern regarding the lack of responses from the PIC. Good communication can serve to maintain a shared understanding and situation awareness....This occurrence is an apt reminder of the guidance given in the Flight Crew Training Manual (FCTM) that, when automation does not perform as expected, the flight crew should reduce the level of auto-flight and identify and resolve the condition and that the original level of auto-flight should only be resumed after they have regained proper control of the flight path and performance level.Notwithstanding that the PIC had achieved an above-average grade and been considered good in the area of auto-flight management during his line and base checks, the investigation team felt that it might be desirable for the operator to review its auto-flight management assessment programme to ensure that it is robust.Metars:ZSPD 021900Z VRB01MPS 9999 -SHRA BKN012 OVC040 24/23 Q1013 NOSIG=ZSPD 021830Z 05002MPS 360V100 9999 -SHRA BKN012 OVC040 24/23 Q1013 NOSIG=ZSPD 021800Z 06003MPS 350V090 9999 -SHRA BKN012 OVC040 24/23 Q1013 NOSIG=ZSPD 021730Z 05004MPS 360V090 9999 BKN012 OVC040 24/23 Q1013 NOSIG=ZSPD 021700Z 04004MPS 360V080 9999 BKN012 OVC040 24/23 Q1013 NOSIG=ZSPD 021630Z 05003MPS 010V090 9999 -SHRA BKN012 OVC040 24/23 Q1013 NOSIG=ZSPD 021600Z 08004MPS 010V120 9999 -SHRA SCT011 OVC040 24/23 Q1013 BECMG TL1630 BKN010 OVC040=ZSPD 021530Z 08004MPS 040V100 9999 -SHRA SCT011 23/23 Q1013 NOSIG=ZSPD 021500Z 09005MPS 050V110 9999 -SHRA SCT011 23/23 Q1014 NOSIG=The reconstructed route page, left original, right the amendment (Graphics: TSIB):
An Alitalia Airbus A320-200, registration EI-DTB performing flight AZ-9041 from Milan Malpensa to Rome Fiumicino (Italy) with 103 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Malpensa's runway 35R at 17:16L (15:16Z) when the crew rejected takeoff and vacated the runway via high speed turn off about 1000 meters/3300 feet down the runway. A replacement Airbus A320-200 registration EI-DSV reached Rome with a delay of about 4 hours.On Aug 24th 2017 Italy's ANSV reported EI-DTB rejected takeoff from runway 35R following a tail strike. The aircraft returned to the apron. Following collection of evidence the ANSV rated the occurrence a serious incident and opened an investigation.On Aug 31st 2017 The Aviation Herald received additional information from the ANSV stating the aircraft "sustained a tail strike after setting takeoff thrust". Following an immediate reduction of takeoff thrust and application of brakes the aircraft's attitude returned to normal. The aircraft taxied off the runway, passengers disembarked normally.The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground in Milan until Aug 23rd, then positioned to Rome, but has not yet resumed service 169 hours after rejected takeoff in Milan and 28 hours after landing in Rome.On Apr 15th 2021 the ANSV released their final report in Italian only (editorial note: to serve the purpose of global prevention of the repeat of causes leading to an occurrence an additional timely release of all occurrence reports in the only world spanning aviation language English would be necessary, an Italian only release does not achieve this purpose as set by ICAO annex 13 and just forces many aviators to waste much more time and effort each in trying to understand the circumstances leading to the occurrence. Aviators operating internationally are required to read/speak English besides their local language, investigators need to be able to read/write/speak English to communicate with their counterparts all around the globe.)The report concludes the probable causes of the serious incident were:human/organizational factors, an inappropriate distribution of passengers caused a serious imbalance of the aircraft at the start of the takeoff run.Contributing factors were:- the sporadicity of the multi leg flights performed by the operator- lack of procedures for locd control and monitoring of load distribution due to insufficient information exchange between handlers and dispatch office, also due to the inadequacy of the module used to communicate the load for multi leg flights- the lack of visual checks of the passenger distribution on board prior to takeoff compared to the load sheet- the lack of perceiption by the cabin crew of the criticality of the passenger distribution for the safety of the flightThe ANSV reported the aircraft did not receive any structural damage, an abraded surface of about 1.80 meters by 30cm was noted at the bottom of the fuselage and an abrasion at the drain mast though.The ANSV analysed weather did not play any role in the occurrence. The data downloaded from the black boxes did not show any anomaly or mistake by the operating flight crew nor did they provide any evidence of a malfunction of the aircraft.The aircraft had operated a multi-leg daily rotation from Rome Fiumicino to Milan Malpensa to Hamburg (Germany) to Milan Malpensa to Rome Fiumicino.The ANSV analysed 171 passengers had departed Hamburg, 68 of which were destined for Milan and 103 for Rome. The handler in Hamburg assigned seat rows 1-12 to the passengers to Malpensa and seat rows 13 and aft to the passengers to Rome. In addition three ULDs of luggage destined for Milan were put into the forward cargo hold. This distribution was intended to facilitate unloading and refitting at Malpensa, however, the handler in Hamburg was not using the software system used by the operator requiring to send the loading data in e-mail using the A320 LDS paper form to dispatch/load control.The software module was not designed to accept the seat conditions on multi-leg flights distinct for two or more destinations. The load controller thus did not have the information to finalize the load sheet and assumed a reasonable but unverified seat distribution. This did not cause any problem on the sector HAM-MXP, however, the controller did not anticipate that the MXP handler would consider the seat distribution as valid. The load sheet thus assumed 33 passengers in the forward section of the aircraft, 39 in the middle section and 31 in the aft section of the cabin. However, the actual distribution was 4 passengers in the forward, 47 passengers in the middle and 52 passengers in the aft section of the cabin. In addition the forward cargo hold became emptied in MXP.In this weight distribution, when the crew applied thrust for takeoff, the aircraft became sufficiently unbalanced so that the tail contacted the runway surface. The crew immediately rejected takeoff, the maximum speed over ground reached was 42 knots.The ANSV had concluded in a similiar way about a similiar occurrence in 2009, see Accident: BH Air A320 at Verona on Sep 1st 2009, tail strike on takeoff. Germany's BFU had also released similiar conclusions in 2014, see Report: Sky Airlines B738 at Stuttgart on Apr 23rd 2005, tail strike at low speed, rejected takeoff.Metars:LIMC 171720Z 24008KT CAVOK 31/15 Q1017 NOSIG=LIMC 171650Z 23006KT 200V270 9999 FEW060 31/16 Q1017 NOSIG=LIMC 171620Z 22008KT 200V270 9999 FEW050 32/16 Q1017 NOSIG=LIMC 171550Z 27007KT 190V320 9999 FEW060 32/16 Q1018 NOSIG=LIMC 171520Z 26006KT 190V320 9999 FEW060 32/16 Q1018 NOSIG=LIMC 171450Z VRB04KT 9999 SCT050 33/16 Q1018 NOSIG=LIMC 171420Z 29007KT 240V320 9999 SCT050 33/16 Q1018 NOSIG=LIMC 171350Z VRB04KT 9999 SCT050 32/16 Q1018 NOSIG=LIMC 171320Z 11004KT 050V180 9999 SCT050 32/16 Q1019 NOSIG=LIMC 171250Z 15006KT 070V200 9999 SCT050 33/16 Q1019 NOSIG=LIMC 171220Z VRB04KT 9999 SCT050 31/16 Q1019 NOSIG=LIMC 171150Z VRB06KT 9999 SCT050 31/16 Q1020 NOSIG=LIMC 171120Z 19005KT 160V220 9999 SCT060 31/16 Q1020 NOSIG=The damage to the tail (Photo: ANSV):
A CAA Compagnie Africaine Aviation Airbus A321-200, registration UR-CSU performing flight BU-321 from Kinshasa to Kisangani (DR Congo), was accelerating for takeoff from Kinshasa's runway 24 when just after reaching V1 the right hand engine's (CFM56) generator failed. The crew continued takeoff, climbed out and had just levelled off at enroute FL300 when the transformer rectifier TR2 also failed. The crew decided to return to Kinshasa where the aircraft landed safely on runway 24.On Apr 15th 2021 Ukraine's NBAAI reported the right hand generator control unit GCU2 was replaced, the settings of the transformer TR2 were reset. After system checks the aircraft was returned to service.
A S7 Sibir Airlines Airbus A320-200N, registration VQ-BCR performing flight S7-1146 from Chelyabinsk to Moscow Domodedovo (Russia) with 157 passengers and 7 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Chelyabinsk's runway 27 when at about 130 KIAS a bird impacted the aircraft in the area of the left hand engine (PW1127G). In the absence of any abnormal indication the crew continued the flight to Moscow where the aircraft landed safely on runway 14R about 2:10 hours after departure.Rosaviatsia reported a post flight inspection the bird had been ingested by the left hand engine and had caused damage in the area of the compressor. The aircraft was removed from service, a borescopic inspection was initiated.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Moscow about 24 hours after landing.
An American Airlines Airbus A321-200, registration N575UW performing flight AA-588 from Charlotte,NC to Phoenix,AZ (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Charlotte's runway 36C when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 70 knots over ground) due to the failure of the right hand engine (V2533). The aircraft slowed safely, stopped on the runway for about 5 minutes. The crew subsequently recommended to sweep the runway until the point they came to stop at about 700 meters/2300 feet down the runway. The crew of another aircraft reported their flight attendants observed a flame out of the back of the right hand engine when N575UW rejected takeoff. N575UW subsequently taxied along the runway to vacate the runway via a high speed turn off about mid runway (1560 meters/5100 feet down the runway) and returned to the apron.A replacement A321-200 registration N162UW reached Phoenix with a delay of 4.5 hours.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Charlotte about 46 hours after the rejected takeoff.

An American Airlines Airbus A321-200N, registration N405AN performing flight AA-615 from Phoenix,AZ to Chicago O'Hare,IL (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from runway 07L when the crew rejected takeoff at about 80 KIAS. The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway, the crew advised no assistance was needed, they had rejected takeoff due to a navigation issue. The aircraft returned to the apron.The aircraft was able to depart about 2 hours later and reached Chicago with a delay of 80 minutes.
A Cargojet Boeing 757-200 freighter, registration C-FGKJ performing flight W8-925 from Vancouver,BC (Canada) to Cincinnati,KY (USA) with 2 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Vancouver's runway 26L when the crew rejected takeoff at about 80 KIAS when the crew received a "R HYD ENG PUMP" EICAS message associated with PRESS illuminated switch light. The crew slowed the aircraft to taxi speed, vacated the runway and stopped for a check of their brakes by emergency services. Subsequently the aircraft taxied to the apron.The Canadian TSB reported maintenance performed an inspection and engine runs with associated system tests, then deferred the defect as "Center and Right Pump Indication System Defective". 
An Iran Aseman Airlines Fokker 100, registration EP-ATE performing flight EP-3962 from Tehran Mehrabad to Ardabil (Iran) with 87 passengers and 7 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from runway 29L when the right hand engine (Tay 650) failed prompting the crew to reject takeoff at 91 KIAS. The crew shut the engine down and returned to the apron.On Oct 20th 2020 Iran's AIB released a brief preliminary report in Persian reporting a first visual inspection revealed that parts of the turbine had been ejected through the engine casing and housing and impacted and penetrated the fuselage causing damage to some cables of the aircraft. One of the flight attendants in the aft cabin remained uninjured although engine parts flew past her in close proximity, all occuptants of the aircraft did not suffer any injuries. The AIB rated the occurrence a serious incident, opened an investigation and downloaded the blackboxes. The investigation is ongoing.On Dec 23rd 2020 Germany's BFU reported they have joined the investigation led by Iran representing the state of engine design.On Mar 29th 2021 the Dutch Onderzoeksraad (DSB) reported they have offered their assistance to Iran's AIB investigating the uncontained engine failure.The engine seen by the AIB Iran (Photo: AIB Iran):The fuselage damage (Photo: AIB Iran):
An Aeroflot Airbus A330-300, registration VP-BDD performing flight SU-1703 from Vladivostok to Moscow Sheremetyevo (Russia), was accelerating for takeoff from Vladivostok's runway 25L when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (just below 80 knots over ground) due to an engine (Trent 772) failure. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The aircraft is still on the ground in Vladivostok about 17 hours after the rejected takeoff.The airport reported the passengers disembarked and were taken to hotels.Passengers reported one of the engines failed during the takeoff run, the crew reacted quickly as lightning.
A Brussels Airlines Airbus A330-300 on behalf of Eurowings, registration OO-SFP performing flight EW-1278 from Frankfurt/Main (Germany) to Windhoek (Namibia), was lined up and cleared for takeoff from Frankfurt's runway 25C when the crew upon initiating the takeoff rejected takeoff at low speed. The aircraft vacated the runway at the third available exit about 700 meters/2300 feet down the runway and returned to the apron.A passenger reported the crew indicated a computer problem, maintenance would shortly arrive. The passengers were kept on board.The aircraft was able to depart 110 minutes after the rejected takeoff and is currently climbing through FL180.
A Royal Air Maroc Avions de Transport Regional ATR-72-212A, registration CN-COH performing flight AT-8743 from Ben Slimane to Casablanca (Morocco), was accelerating for takeoff from Ben Slimane's runway 32 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed a second time due to a recurring airspeed disagree indication. The aircraft slowed safely. In the following fire was seen from the #4 wheel. Morocco's AIB rated the occurrence a serious incident and opened an investigation reporting, there were no injuries, the aircraft sustained minor damage.Some time in the past (discovered only on Mar 12th 2021 following a re-design of BEA Maroc's website) the Maroc's BEA released their final report in French only (editorial note: to serve the purpose of global prevention of the repeat of causes leading to an occurrence an additional timely release of all occurrence reports in the only world spanning aviation language English would be necessary, a French only release does not achieve this purpose as set by ICAO annex 13 and just forces many aviators to waste much more time and effort each in trying to understand the circumstances leading to the occurrence. Aviators operating internationally are required to read/speak English besides their local language, investigators need to be able to read/write/speak English to communicate with their counterparts all around the globe.)The report concludes the probable causes of the serious incident were:- obstruction of pitot probes that caused an underreading of airspeeds on takeoff- the difference in airspeeds was not identified during the first takeoff run due to failure to apply the operational procedures- excessive actions and excessive braking following the two rejected takeoffs as well as high speed taxiing with engines in flight idleContributing factors were:- lack of ATR procedures for cooling brakes after a rejected takeoff- time pressure related to airport closure- failure at cockpit resource management level- human factors related to stress and strong authority gradient between captain and first officer- risks associated with the Ben Slimane Aerodrome's environment that could clog pitot tubes without cover (presence of insects and impurities)The BEA reported the captain (51, ATPL, 14,000 hours total, 6,500 hours on type) was pilot monitoring, the first officer (46, CPL, 4,776 hours total, 1,286 hours on type) was pilot flying.When the aircraft attempted the first takeoff run, an airspeed problem occurred, however, the takeoff was continued, the aircraft lifted off reaching 5 feet AGL by itself undetected by the crew however could not sustain flight touching down again 17 seconds after lift off at which point the commander decided to reject takeoff. The aircraft returned to the threshold runway 32 and attempted another takeoff run 5 minutes after the first. This time the takeoff was rejected upon an "IAS DISAGREE" indication, taxied to the end of the runway, vacated the runway. While taxiing towards the apron tower advised the crew of fire at the right hand engine (PW127M) and alerted emergency services, the crew stopped the aircraft, applied the fire checklist for the right hand engine and evacuated the aircraft. Fire fighters put the fire at the landing gear out.The BEA reported the aircraft had just come out of a an A check performed by the company's maintenance workshop located at Ben Slimane Airport.The BEA analysed that the airline had a staffing problem. The captain of the flight arrived for the occurrence flight only one hour prior to closure of the aerodrome. In addition, the flight plan had not yet been activated at that point, so that the crew before engine start needed to call in to activate the flight, which added additional stresses to the crew. This management of flight crew as well as flight planning thus contributed to the serious incident.The interventions by tower and emergency services of Ben Slimane were timely and effective, which prevented further damage. The BEA annotated that the tower controller had granted an additional 5 minutes past the closure time of the aerodrome when the crew conducted their second takeoff run and tower subsequently reported there was fire from the right hand engine.A blow test on the pitot probes confirmed debris in all (!) pitot tubes. The left hand pitot tube was "slightly obstructed", the right hand pitot probe was "obstructed", the standby pitot probe was "very clogged".The Ben Slimane Airport environment is characterised by vegetation and straws, which in the summer period become a potential danger of infiltration of small grains of straw or dust in pitot probes and static ports but also pose a high risk of insects entering these probes and ports. Protective measures like covers could have prevented the accumulation of impurities inside the pitot probes.The high authority gradient in the cockpit with the company's air operations manager and instructor at the controls as captain in relation to the first officer might have contributed to the serious incident. The first officer stated in his post occurrence interviews, that he had high esteem for the captain and thus felt unable to speak up, also because of anxiety due to the time pressures because of the impending aerodrome closure. In addition, the commander communicated with tower in French and Arabic, both languages were not understood by the first officer.During the first takeoff run the indicated airspeed did not exceed 70 KIAS when the takeoff was rejected about 16 seconds after full throttle was applied. During that time the calibrated airspeed had risen to 97 knots, however, the left hand IAS was 49 knots and the right hand IAS was 35 knots, the airspeed disagree indication had illuminated, all of which was missed by the flight crew.While the aircraft was airborne during the first takeoff run, the calibrated airspeed did actually exceed Vr of 104 knots and reached 107 knots with a speed over ground of 106 knots. However, the crew observed 56 knots at the left IAS and 36 knots at the right IAS. The crew did not attempt to provide inputs to climb the aircraft. The aircraft touched down again producing a vertical load of +1.6G. Wheels #4 and #2 were subsequently exposed to heavy load, also due to high speed taxiing with the thrust levers at flight idle for about 3000 meters. The brakes blocks ran hot.The second takeoff run reached a calibrated airspeed of 96 knots with indications of 52 KIAS left and 34 KIAS right, the airspeed disagree indication illuminated again. This time the crew noticed the indications having been aware that they had an airspeed problem.Although the stand by pitot probe was determined very clogged, it was identified the debris did NOT obstruct the air flow, the stand by ASI thus indicated correctly.The fire damage (Photo: BEA Maroc):The development of the fire (Graphics: BEA Maroc):Point 1: Vacating the runway after second rejected takeoffPoint 2: Tracks of tyre #4Point 3: tyre #4 deflatingPoint 4: tracks of tyre #2 Point 5: traces of hydraulic oilPoint 6: start of fire at wheel #4Point 7: start of fire at wheel #2Point 8: aircraft stopped
An American Airlines Airbus A319-100, registration N9021H performing flight AA-1844 from Chicago O'Hare,IL to Jackson,WY (USA) with 53 people on board, was climbing out of O'Hare's runway 09C when the crew declared emergency reporting they had just had a bird strike on takeoff, stopped the climb at 5000 feet. The crew reported they took a "full Canada goose" into engine #1 (CFM56, left hand) resulting in high vibrations and EGT and N2 fluctuations. The crew advised that the engine was now operating nearly normal, but not normal enough to continue the flight. The aircraft positioned for an approach to runway 10C and landed safely about 15 minutes after departure and taxied to the apron.A replacement A319-100 registration N8009T reached Jackson with a delay of 3 hours.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Chicago about 24 hours after landing back.The FAA reported: "AIRCRAFT ENGINE #1 INGESTED A GOOSE DAMAGING BLADES AND ACOUSTICAL PANEL, CHICAGO, IL." The occurrence resulted in "unknown" damage. https://flightaware.com/live/flight/AAL1844/history/20210309/1555Z/KORD/KJAC
A South Sudan Supreme Airlines Let L-410, fake registration HK-4274 (MSN 902525) performing a charter flight from Pieri to Yuai (South Sudan) with 8 passengers and 2 crew, crashed shortly after takeoff from Pieri at 17:05L (15:05Z). All on board perished in the crash.The owner of South Sudan Supreme Airlines (former South Supreme Airlines) confirmed they had an aircraft out which has not returned to the home base Juba so far.Jonglei State's Governor confirmed the aircraft with tail number HK-4274 crashed at Pieri Airstrip in Jonglei State of South Sudan at 17:05L (see letter below).A South Sudan Opposition Leader said, the aircraft with the tail number HK-4274 crashed shortly after takeoff and killed all on board (editorial note: apart from the fact, that the registration would point to a Colombian Aircraft absolutely nothing can be found with the tail number).Juba Airport confirmed the aircraft registration HK-4274 had departed for Pieri earlier the day but had not returned to Juba. The aircraft belongs to South Sudan Supreme Airline and was a very new acquisition of the airline, hence had not been re-registered yet. On Mar 3rd 2021 the airport confirmed the aircraft in question was a Let L-410.On Mar 4th 2021 South Sudan's Civil Aviation Authority reported they have dispatched a team of investigators on site. Preliminary investigation results suggest that the aircraft was climbing out of Pieri when one of the engines (M601E) failed prompting the crew to return to Pieri. While enroute back to Pieri the other engine failed, too, causing the forced landing and accident.South Sudan Supreme Airlines is known to operate Antonov AN-26s and Let L-410s. Pieri Airstrip features an unpaved runway and is capable of accomodating both AN26s and L410s.On Mar 3rd 2021 The Aviation Herald received information, that the accident aircraft was a Let L-410UVP with a fake registration, the previous Burundi fake registration of which had been flagged. Before the Burundi fake registration the airline had used the aircraft since 2019 also with the fake Gabonese registration TR-KSS - the aircraft had been photographed with this registration in Juba on Jan 1st 2019. TR-KSS had not been photographed prior to 2019 however. According to Russian dabases the airline had acquired a L410 tail number 5Y-DAD (MSN 902436) by the end of 2014, which subsequently was photographed several times until late 2017, however, no photographs of 5Y-DAD surfaced after 2017 (the paint scheme of 5Y-DAD entirely matched TR-KSS except for the tail number. It appears the paint scheme of the wreckage also matches the paint scheme on past photos of TR-KSS and 5Y-DAD).On Mar 4th 2021 it became known that South Sudan's president has grounded South Sudan Supreme Airlines with immediate effect on Mar 2nd 2021 pending a safety audit of the operator.On Mar 4th 2021 The Aviation Herald received a photo of a South Supreme Airlines Airframe in old paint scheme with the tail number 5Y-DAD sitting rotting in Nairobi on December 8th 2020 and obviously unable to resume flying any time soon. There is no information on MSN or other details of this airframe though.On Mar 4th 2021 the aircraft manufacturer Let reported, that they also do not know which aircraft actually crashed in Pieri, no information has yet been received from South Sudan's Aircraft Accident Investigation Authority. According to their records: - A L410 formerly owned by South Supreme Airlines (before their name change to South Sudan Supreme Airlines) with the tail number 5Y-SSA (MSN 902525) subsequently changed hands to a new operator (Editorial note: according to local Juba sources that airframe had been seen operating in Juba up to year 2017 and has not been seen later on). Let stated that the operators before South Supreme Airlines had been: Business Aviation Center, Universal Avia and Rivne (editorial note: this is in line with Russian databases who lost track of the airframe, then tail number ST-RAS, in 2009 however).- A L410 with the tailnumber 5Y-DAD (MSN 902436) was registered with Let to be operated by Attico, the former operator had been Njurba. Let has no knowledge of any airframe 5Y-DAD associated with South Supreme Airlines (Editorial note: databases differ considerably from this information, neither of the databases identifies Attico or Njurba during the history of MSN 902436).- The operator South Sudan Supreme Airlines is not known to Let, only the company under its former name South Suprseme Airlines.On Mar 5th 2021 South Sudan's CAA reported the aircraft involved with the tailnumber HK-4274 was MSN 902525 (former 5Y-SSA).According to a document released by Kenyan Aircraft Registry the L410 tail number 5Y-SSA (MSN 902525) had been deleted from the Kenyan aircraft register on Nov 23rd 2017 due to a hand over to Gabon (the AVH is still waiting for reply from Gabon's Aircraft Registry - it is presumed the aircraft became TR-KSS, was flagged in 2020, changed to a Burundi registration, was flagged again in late 2020 or early 2021 and was repainted HK-4274).

An Azul Linhas Aereas Avion de Transport Regional ATR-72-212A, registration PR-AQP performing flight AD-4296 from Sao Paulo Viracopos,SP to Bauru,SP (Brazil) with 46 passengers and 4 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Viracopos' runway 15 when the crew rejected takeoff at about 70 knots over ground due to a problem with the left hand engine (PW127M). The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.Brazil's CENIPA reported the crew received a "ENG #1 OIL HIGH PRESS" indication, performed the QRH procedures and rejected takeoff. The occurrence was rated an incident.
An Aeroflot Sukhoi Superjet 100-95, registration RA-89125 performing flight SU-1508 from Moscow Sheremetyevo to Tyumen (Russia), was accelerating for takeoff from Sheremteyevo's runway 24C when the crew rejected takeoff at about 80 knots over ground due to a problem with the brakes. The aircraft slowed safely, stopped on the runway and remained on the runway for about 20 minutes before being towed off the runway.A replacement SU95 registration RA-89026 reached Tyumen with a delay of 2.5 hours.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Moscow about 16 hours after rejecting takeoff.
An Alitalia Airbus A319-100, registration EI-IMM performing flight AZ-884 from Rome Fiumicino (Italy) to Malta (Malta), was accelerating for takeoff from Fiumicino's runway 25 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 110 knots over ground) due to a bird strike. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.A replacement A319-100 registration EI-IMG reached Malta with a delay of 2.5 hours.The occurrence aircraft returned to service about 40 hours after the rejected takeoff.A passenger reported they heard a bang from the left hand side and an orange flash from the left engine (CFM56), immediately afterwards the brakes came on. The flight attendants announced the takeoff had been aborted and more information would follow, the captain subsequently announced that a bird strike had occurred, they would disembark and board another aircraft.
An AIS Airlines Jetstream JS-3201 on behalf of Flexflight, registration PH-RCI performing flight W2-6505 from Muenster to Stuttgart (Germany) with 1 passenger and 3 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from runway 25, the first officer (26, CPL, 157 hours total, 47 minutes on type) was pilot flying, the captain (63, ATPL, 8,680 hours total, 767 hours on type) was pilot momitoring and supervising the first officer on his first flight under supervision. During the acceleration the captain steered the aircraft via the nose wheel steering, then handed control to the first officer at 70 KIAS. When the aircraft reached 108 KIAS (=V1) 6 seconds after the controls were handed to the first officer, the captain called "V1, rotate", the first officer however was unable to rotate the aircraft and called out " ... can not pull ... the steering wheel". The aircraft veered right, the captain attempted to correct via rudder pedals and rejected takeoff 7 seconds after the V1 call at about 130 KIAS, then reverted to nose wheel steering. While slowing the aircraft went off the runway about 1,080 meters/3,540 feet, rolled about 530 meters/1,740 feet over soft ground and a taxiway (at 119 KIAS) with maximum 23 meters off the right side of the runway and returned onto the runway where the aircraft slowed to taxi speed and subsequently returned to the apron. The captain informed tower they rejected takeoff because they still had their gust locks on.On Dec 27th 2019 Germany'S BFU reported in their October 2019 bulletin that another aircraft was waiting at the hold short line when the JS32 crossed the taxiway between runway edge and hold short line at 119 KIAS.The first officer had not flown on type for more than 3 months and felt being behind the aircraft already during taxiing the aircraft via D and A to runway 25. While approaching the hold short line the crew contacted tower and received takeoff clearance. The crew subsequently worked the Line Up checklist with the first officer reading the points of the checklist. The first officer however overlooked the point "Flight Controls" in that checklist, the flight controls thus were not checked for free movement by either pilot. On a further point "Stall Protection" the first officer did not find the relevant switches, the captain found them "not so important", hence the stall protections were't activated. 92 seconds after being cleared for takeoff the crew commenced takeoff, the captain noticed, while steering the aircraft via nose wheel steering, that stall protections and landing lights were not switched on. Upon reaching 70 knots the captain handed controls to the first officer. The captain later reported that the aircraft continued straight for a couple of seconds before veering right.Following the rejected takeoff a runway inspection found damage to runway edge light, a sign (for the glider area). The aircraft received damage to a right propeller blade, the left main tyre and the right luggage hold, fuel leaked at the joints of left and right main gear struts to the wings. The captain reported the gust lock lever was in the upper position, which locks the flight controls.The BFU reported with the gust lock lever in the locked position, it should have been impossible to advance the thrust levers to above flight idle. However, the thrust levers could be freely moved even with the gust lock lever in the locked position. The fork end of a driving rod, that should have locked the thrust levers, was found bent by 45 degrees, so that it could no longer block the thrust levers. That mechanism had been last checked on Mar 19th 2019 with no anomaly detected.There had been 4 similiar occurrences where the rod had bent and was no longer able to prevent the thrust levers to be moved above flight idle with the gust lock lever in the locked position. An enforced version of the control rod was designed in 1992 and highly recommended to be used. The recommendation however had not been implemented on the occurrence aircraft.On Feb 8th 2021 the BFU released their final report concluding the probable causes of the serious incident were:Veering off the runway during take-off run occurred due to the engaged Gust Lock system which locked the control surfaces and resulted in the pilots loosing temporary control of the aircraft.Contributing Factors:- Insufficient supervision, support and monitoring of the Line Training Instructor- Inexperience of the young co-pilot and long time gap between type rating and the first commercial scheduled flight- Insufficient Crew Resource Management of the flight crew- Pressure of time created by the crew between engine start-up and take-off- Non-stringent application and erroneous completion of the checklists- Checklist items, procedures and choice of wording in the checklists of the operator which did not completely correspond with the ones of the aircraft manufacturer A mechanically deficiency in the Gust Lock system, which allowed the engine power of both engines to be increased simultaneously, was also a contributing factor. The BFU analysed:The serious incident, take-off run with engaged Gust Lock system during commercial scheduled services, and veering off the runway, occurred involving a flight crew who was very different in regard to age, years of professional experience, flying and type experience.The 63-year-old PIC has to be viewed as very experienced in regard to his total flying experience and the number of years working in aviation. The major part of his flying experience he acquired as flight instructor during training flights in flight schools. He had been flying the type concerned since 2018. The operator deployed him as Line Training Instructor, i.e. as someone, who is training, instructing, and monitoring new pilots to adhere to the companys procedures. The BFU is of the opinion that especially during Line Training it should be self-evident that checklists are completed item by item and that the required time for all actions is taken. The exemplary function during training and especially preparation of scheduled services should be clear to everyone at all times. The BFU is of the opinion that for a young or new pilot of a company good practices of an experienced PIC or Line Training Instructor are formative and important for the safety culture and flight safety.Compared with the PIC the 26-year-old co-pilot was very inexperienced. His realtime-flying experience on type was less than one hour. The day of the occurrence was his first day of work for the operator, in commercial air operations and after acquiring his type rating. The BFU is of the opinion that due to the time gap between finishing his type rating and the first flight, intensive attention of the Line Training Instructor would have been required to prevent asking too much of the co-pilot and compromising Crew Resource Management. The BFU is of the opinion that the inexperience and the large age and experience gradient within the flight crew made an equal flight-safety-improving CRM difficult.At the day of the occurrence, the crew met sufficiently early to have enough time for the first Line Training flight and to ensure a safe conduct of flight. The BFU is of the opinion that the slot arrangement and the relatively late engine start-up in spite of early clearance at their own discretion 20 minutes prior to the intended slot resulted in unnecessary haste. Within 10 minutes engine start-up occurred, taxi instructions and clearances were received, taxiing to the runway and line-up were conducted. During the same time Before Start, Start Up, After Start, Taxi and Line up checklists should have been completed. Especially during the first flight of the Line Training sufficient time would have been required. The CVR recording showed that during Line up the checklist items Flight Controls CHECKED and Stall Protection TESTED & ON were not completed. Therefore, the engaged Gust Lock system was not detected during Line-up.The meteorological conditions did not limit the intended flight. Neither visibilities, clouds nor the prevailing wind should have resulted in distraction during the preparation, taxiing or take off run.There was little traffic at the airport. The general procedures and the taxi procedures at the airport were clear and not demanding or distracting, as it could be at, for example, large airports with confusing procedures and designations, several run- and taxiways and high traffic volume.The serious incident occurred during the take-off run for the third flight of the aircraft of the day. The BFU does not have any information of technical limitations which would have resulted in distraction or impairment of the flight crew to complete all checklist items and adhere to procedures.The aircraft type has been operated in commercial air transport for decades, especially for short-distance flights in feeder operations. As a result, compared with the operating time, this type of flight creates a high number of flight cycles. The aircraft involved also had a higher number of flight cycles than operating time. In comparison to some other aircraft the design of the Gust Lock system to lock the flight controls during parking of this aircraft type was complex. The Gust Lock lever was installed in a slightly unfavourable position in the cockpit, i.e. a location easily overlooked by pilots. According to the manufacturers check items of checklists for engine start-up, taxiing and last checks prior to take-off (POWER levers Full and free, GUST LOCK lever Confirm in OUT position, STALL PROTECTION system Tested ON, Stall Protection Tested & ON, Flying controls Full and free) it should have been ensured that a flight crew realises in time prior to take-off run that the Gust Lock system was not disengaged. In addition, as a last technical barrier it should not have been possible to increase engine power with both power levers simultaneously. The BFU is of the opinion that it is probable that other flight crew did not check the proper function of the Gust Lock system during pre-flight preparation or cockpit checks and that the technical deficiency had existed for some time.Procedures and checklists of the operator of the aircraft involved deviated in some items and choice of wording from the published procedures and checklists of the aircraft manufacturer. The checklist item GUST LOCK RELEASE / FULLY DOWN was missing in the Taxi and Line-up check. The checklist item FLYING CONTROLS FULL and FREE was shortened to Flight Controls CHECKED. Checking the full and free movement of the flight controls was moved from the Taxi check to the Lineup check.The BFU is of the opinion that the missing checklist items regarding the Gust Lock system and the choice of wording for checking the flight controls is not acceptable. Checking the flight controls should occur prior to Line-up as it was intended by the manufacturer, and as it is commonly practised. In general, at airports there is usually no time for time-consuming Line-up checks on the runway. In spite of the deviations, the correct completion of all checklist items of the operator should have ensured that the Gust Lock system was disengaged and the full movement of flight controls checked. The current and similar occurrences in the past involving this aircraft type show that several flight crews forgot to disengage the Gust Lock system and/or did not detect an incomplete unlocking due to insufficient check of flying controls prior to the takeoff run, and that several control rods for blocking the power levels were bent. The BFU is of the opinion that EASA should change the Highly Recommended Service Bulletin (SB) 27JM-535 of the manufacturer to a mandatory Airworthiness Directive to ensure that the power levers of all aircraft of this type are locked if the Gust Lock system is engaged.Incidents during take-off run due to engaged Gust Lock systems occur around the world time and again. This is surprising since the problem has been known for decades. The BFU can only support the findings of the multiple investigations of forgotten Gust Lock systems and refer to the importance of extensive flying training, compliance with and adherence to procedures and checklists and mutual monitoring as part of flight-safety-improving CRM. The maintenance personnel should understand the importance of a fully functional Gust Lock system, which does not allow take-off in the engaged position, and check the proper function regularly.Ultimately, only a complete check of flight controls prior to a take-off run can ensure that all flight controls are full and free.Ground tracks (Photo: BFU):Trajectory of aircraft (Graphics: BFU):
An Aeroflot Sukhoi Superjet 100-95, registration RA-89042 performing flight SU-1357 from Saratov to Moscow Sheremetyevo (Russia) with 69 passengers and 5 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Saratov's runway 08 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 30 knots over ground) due to a technical malfunction. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The flight was cancelled. The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Saratov about 10 hours after the rejected takeoff.
An EAT Leipzig Airbus A300-600 freighter on behalf of DHL, registration D-AEAI performing flight QY-841 from Brussels (Belgium) to Vitoria,SP (Spain), was accelerating for takeoff from Brussels' runway 25R at about 18:11L (17:11Z) when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (approx. 150 knots over ground). The aircraft slowed and stopped on the runway about 360 meters/1200 feet short of the runway end (about 2920 meters/9600 feet after the start of the takeoff roll), however, was disabled with deflated main tyres. Emergency services responded and attended to the aircraft.The runway returned to service at around 04:31L (03:31Z) about 10:20 hours after the occurrence.The airport reported "Following a technical incident runway 25R has not been available. Runway 19 is used for departures and runway 25L for landings."Belgium's AAIU opened an investigation into the occurrence.The airline reported the crew encountered difficulties to takeoff prompting them to reject takeoff during rotation when the nose gear had already become airborne. At that point the crew checked their airspeed, it was still slow enough to reject takeoff. Due to the heavy braking 8 tyres deflated. The cause of the problems to become airborne are under investigation, however, it certainly was no problem with the cargo.On Dec 3rd 2020 the Belgium AAIU stated the crew reported a normal acceleration of the aircraft during the takeoff roll. During rotation the nose did pitch up, however, the aircraft did not lift off. The crew rejected takeoff, applied reverse thrust and brought the aircraft to a stop between taxiways A6 and A7. The occurrence was rated a serious incident and is being investigated. On Jan 28th 2021 Germany's BFU reported in their November bulletin that the aircraft was accelerating for takeoff when the crew felt vibrations just prior to V1. The aircraft increased pitch upon rotation, but did not lift off prompting the captain to reject takeoff. The aircraft came to a stand still on the runway, as result of the heat developed by the brakes all main tyres deflated. The BFU assists the investigations in accordance with ICAO Annex 13 representing the state of registry. On Jan 29th 2021 The Aviation Herald received information, that SOP at the operator require to turn the trim to +1.0 trim units (1 unit nose up) after landing. In the morning before the incident flight maintenance worked on the aircraft and rolled the trim to -1.1 units (1.1 units nose down). The load sheet computed a trim setting of +1.1 units for departure. While the load sheet used the +/- notation, the trim itself only shows UP and DN, both +1.1 and -1.1 units are within the green band of the trim settings for takeoff, the crew thus missed that the trim was at -1.1 units instead of the required +1.1 units and experienced a very high pitch force during takeoff rotation. The pitch trim is only checked once during working the pre-departure and takeoff checklists, shortly before V1 the crew experienced vibrations drawing the crew attention to the engine parameters. Being above V1 and Vr there was time pressure in decision making. Post non-flight examination did not find any technical anomaly. In simulations it was determined that all pilots exposed to the simulation felt significantly higher pitch forces in this scenario, most crews were not aware of the effects of the wrong trim setting.

A Pobeda Boeing 737-800, registration VQ-BTI performing flight DP-563 from Ekaterinburg to Krasnodar (Russia) with 177 passengers and 6 crew, rejected takeoff at low speed at Ekaterinburg due to an engine (CFM56) anti-ice indication. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The aircraft was able to depart about 3 hours later and reached Krasnodar with a delay of 3 hours.Ural's Transport Prosecution Office is looking into the occurrece caused by an engine anti-ice indication.Rosaviatsia reported the crew rejected takeoff at 53 KIAS due to an "ICE DETECTOR" alarm. Subsequent maintenance did not find any fault in the anti-ice systems and released the aircraft back to service.
A Swift Air Avions de Transport Regional ATR-72-200, registration EC-INV performing flight WT-6992 from Cologne (Germany) to Sofia (Bulgaria), was accelerating for takeoff from Cologne when the crew rejected takeoff due to hitting several runway edge lights.Germany's BFU reported the crew did not realize they had lined up with the runway edge instead of the runway center line lights and hit several edge lights before rejecting takeoff. The aircraft sustained minor damage. The occurrence was rated a serious incident and is being investigated by the BFU.On Jun 8th 2020 the BFU reported in their April bulletin that the aircraft had taxied to runway 06 via taxiway T. At the hold short line they were cleared to enter and backtrack runway 06. The aircraft taxied onto the runway and taxied along the runway centerline towards the turn pad. The captain (56, ATPL, 9,394 hours total, 8,347 hours on type) was steering the aircraft with his left hand and the steering tiller, the before takeoff checklist was read while taxiing towards the turn pad (abeam taxiway B). The aircraft entered the turn pad and then made a left turn to line up runway 06. During the turn there was some noise in the cockpit, the crew tried to identified the noise initially believing a cockpit door had jumped open but then discovered that a bag of the captain had fallen down behind the seat. The captain finished the turn and aligned the aircraft with the white lights in front of him, both pilots, the first officer (52, ATPL, 5,365 hours total, 4,543 hours on type) being pilot monitoring, were sure they had lined up on the center line of the runway. After receiving the takeoff clearance the captain began acceleration of the aircraft for departure. After a short distance the aircraft unexpectedly experienced a number of jolts, the crew also saw something fly away. The crew rejected takeoff. After a brief discussion the crew vacated the runway via taxiway T and returned to the apron still unable to explain the jolts and noises. A subsequent runway inspection revealed 9 left edge lights had been destroyed, one taxiway light had been damaged, too. The aircraft received damage to the nose wheel, bottom of the fuselage near the main wheels and some propeller blades.The BFU reported taxiway B was closed due to work in progress. Similiar occurrences had happened in the past. As result the British AAIB had released a safety recommendation to the ICAO: "It is recommended that the International Civil Aviation Organisation initiate the process to develop within Annex 14 Volume 1, Aerodrome Design and Operations, a standard for runway edge lights that would allow pilots to identify them specifically, without reference to other lights or other airfield features."On Jan 22nd 2021 the BFU released their final report concluding the probable cause of the serious incident was:The Serious Incident occurred because the crew confused the left runway edge marking and lighting of runway 06 of Cologne/Bonn Airport with the centre line and therefore had aligned the airplane unnoticed with the wrong runway lighting for takeoff.Contributing factors:- Low attention level of the crew- Distraction in the cockpit during the turn on the turnpad.- The width and marking in the area of turnpad and the beginning of runway 06.- From the cockpit it was difficult to differentiate between runway edge lighting and centre line lighting.The BFU analysed:The night of the event had been the first flight duty for the crew after a more than 36-hour rest period. From the CVR recording indications for fatigue could not be deduced.The pilots communicated friendly in German with each other. Both pilots had known each other for years and in the cockpit were equal to one another. They had a high type experience as well as in their respective roles as Pilot Flying (PF) and Pilot Monitoring (PM). The atmosphere in the cockpit was relaxed. The recordings showed that during engine start-up, taxiing, and take-off preparations the checklist procedures were applied. The respective checks in the Challenge and Response procedure between PF and PM were conducted efficient, confident and situation-based.Both had taken off from runway 06 of Cologne/Bonn Airport numerous times. They were familiar with the backtrack procedure and turn on the turnpad. The planned flight had been routine for both pilots and did not constitute unusual stress.It is reasonable to assume that take-off was rejected on mutual agreement, even though it was neither discussed nor announced. Communication during standard and especially emergency procedures is however without doubt important and necessary in order to inform the entire crew and involve possible resources. Meteorological ConditionsAt the time of the occurrence it was dark. Ground visibility was more than 10 km. Meteorological limitations, except for the darkness, did not cause the event or posed a contributory factor.On the contrary, the BFU is of the opinion that it is highly likely that the good visibility reduced the attention of the crew and tempted the pilots to not continuously concentrate on following the taxi guidance turnpad markings and question the position of the airplane. AirportDue to the construction, the usual taxiway Bravo to the beginning of runway 06 was closed. Therefore all airplanes had to taxi as so-called backtrack on runway 06, then turn on the turnpad at the beginning of runway 06 for take-off run. The tower controller could not discern whether the airplane was aligned with the runway centre line or not when he issued take-off clearance at night. Due to the simplified depiction of the radar targets, it is not clearly evident on the radar monitor either. The BFU is of the opinion that this constitutes limitation of air traffic control at many large airports which should not pose any safety problems as long as flight crews can clearly recognise and identify runway markings and lightings.Due to the taxiway markings from runway to the turnpad, the white line of the runway edge marking on the turnpad was not a continuous line and therefore showed similarities with centre line markings (Fig. 7). The BFU noted that the alignment for the Misalignment Take-Off occurred along the intermittent runway edge marking and approximately in the centre of the total width of turnpad and runway 06. Therefore, a mix-up is understandable.The reporting archive of the airports lighting system showed that prior to and during the event all lightings had been lit, and the pilots stated that everything had been illuminated as usual. Due to the flat angle from the cockpit towards the respective lighting (runway edge and centre line) the different distances between the individual lamps of the corresponding chain of lights could barely or not at all be seen. This event shows, as other Misalignment Take-offs have, that in darkness with no reference points it is almost impossible to detect the difference between the runway edge and the centre line lighting.View along the left runway edge (Photo: BFU):View along the runway center line (Photo: BFU):Map (Graphics: BFU):
A LATAM Brasil Airbus A320-200, registration PR-TYA performing flight JJ-3142 from Sao Paulo Congonhas,SP to Vitoria,ES (Brazil) with 144 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Congonhas' runway 17L when the crew heard an abnormal noise from the left hand engine (CFM56) and received an "ENG 1 FAIL" ECAM indication. The crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 20 knots over ground), taxied the aircraft along the runway to the first available exit about 965 meters/3150 feet down the runway and returned the aircraft to the apron.Brazil's CENIPA reported the left engine was shut down following the failure and the aircraft returned to the apron. The aircraft received minor damage. The occurrence was rated an incident without investigation.
A Lufthansa Airbus A320-200N, registration D-AIJB performing flight LH-806 from Frankfurt/Main (Germany) to Stockholm (Sweden), was accelerating for intersection takeoff from runway 25C when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (around 70 knots) due to a bird strike into the right hand engine (PW1127G). The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway via a high speed turn off about 970m/3200 feet further down the runway. The aircraft taxied to a remote stand.A replacement A320-200N registration D-AINA reached Stockholm with a delay of about 80 minutes.The occurrence aircraft returned to service about 31 hours after the rejected takeoff.
An Air Mauritius Avions de Transport Regional ATR-72-212A, registration 3B-NBG performing flight MK-150 from Mauritius to Rodrigues Island (Mauritius), was accelerating for takeoff from Mauritius when at about V1 the left (inboard) cowl of the right hand engine (PW127) let go and departed from the engine. The crew continued takeoff, climbed to safe altitude and positioned for a return to Mauritius, where the aircraft landed safely back.Mauritius' AIB rated the occurrence a serious incident and opened an investigation.The engine seen without its inboard cowl:
A LATAM Brasil Airbus A320-200, registration PR-MYK performing flight LA-3408 from Sao Paulo Guarulhos,SP to Joao Pessoa,PB (Brazil) with 136 passengers and 7 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Guarulhos' runway 27R when already above V1 the aircraft hit a capybara on the runway. The crew continued takeoff, climbed to 9000 feet and entered a hold to assess the situation and burn off fuel, then returned to Sao Paulo for a safe landing on Guarulhos' runway 27R about 65 minutes after departure. The aircraft vacated the runway and stopped on the adjacent taxiway for inspection by emergency services, then was towed to the apron.The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground for 3 days.The runway was closed for about an hour while the runway was cleaned.On Jan 14th 2021 Brazil's CENIPA reported all 136 passengers and 7 crew remained uninjured, the aircraft sustained minor damage. The occurrence was rated an incident, no investigation has been opened.Adult capybaras typically weigh between 35 and 66kg, top weights 91 kg.A family of capybaras swimming (Photo: Bob Johnson):
A Vietnam Airlines Airbus A321-200, registration VN-A392 performing flight VN-920 from Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam) to Phnom Penh (Cambodia), was accelerating for takeoff from Ho Chi Minh City's runway 25L when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed due to an "ENG 2 FAIL" indication. The aircraft came to a stop about 1600 meters/5250 feet down the runway. Emergency services responded, not only because of the rejected takeoff but also because of a large smoke plume rising from the grass at the right side of the runway. Emergency services put the grass fire out within about 10 minutes. The passengers disembarked onto the runway via mobile stairs and were taken to the terminal, the aircraft was subsequently towed to the apron.The airline reported there was a technical issue with one of the nose wheel tyres, there was no fire or explosion on the aircraft. The crew rejected takeoff and stopped safely. There were no injuries.Vietnam's Civil Aviation Authority reported a part of the tyre impacted and damaged the side of the right hand engine's (V2533) cover, which in turn caused the grass fire. The CAA have opened an investigation into the occurrence.On Mar 22nd 2020 (Mar 21st 2020 US East Coast Time) the FAA released an emergency airworthiness directive EAD-2020-07-51 for all International Aero Engines AG (IAE) V2522-A5, V2524-A5, V2525-D5, V2527-A5, V2527E-A5, V2527M-A5, V2528-D5, V2530-A5, and V2533-A5 model turbofan engines.The FAA argues: "This emergency AD was prompted by investigative findings from an event that occurred on March 18, 2020, in which an Airbus Model A321-231 airplane, powered by IAE V2533-A5 model turbofan engines, experienced an uncontained high-pressure turbine (HPT) 1st-stage disk failure that resulted in an aborted takeoff. This condition, if not addressed, could result in release of high-energy debris, damage to the engine, damage to the airplane, and loss of the airplane."Operators of such engines are required to determined whether a HPT first stage disk of specific serial numbers are installed and if so, remove those HPT stage 1 disks from the engine within 5 cycles.On Apr 9th 2020 the NTSB reported: "The government of Vietnam has notified the NTSB of an incident involving an Airbus A321 airplane that occurred on March 18, 2020. A Vietnam Airbus A321-231 powered by two International Aero Engines V2533-A5 turbofan engines experienced a No. 2 (right) engine high pressure turbine disk rupture and uncontainment during the takeoff roll from Tan Son Nhat International Airport, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The Captain performed a rejected takeoff and the airplane was stopped safely on the runway; no injuries were report and no evacuation was necessary. Post event engine inspection confirmed a high pressure turbine stage 1 disk had burst and penetrated through the engine case and engine cowling."On Jun 17th 2020 The Aviation Herald learned that the crew heard a loud bang from the right hand side followed by an ECAM "ENG 2 FAIL" indication. The aircraft also began to veer to the right side. The captain took control of the aircraft and rejected takeoff at 130 KIAS. After the aircraft came to a stop the ECAM actions were performed including discharging the fire agent. As result of the rejected takeoff tyre #4 deflated. An assessment by tower and crew indicated no emergency evacuation was needed. The passengers disembarked normally onto the runway and were bussed to the terminal. On Jan 6th 2021 the FAA released another Airworthiness Directive AD-2021-01-03 now also including the high pressure turbine stage 2 disks reasoning:On March 18, 2020, an Airbus Model A321-231 airplane, powered by IAE V2533-A5 model turbofan engines, experienced an uncontained HPT 1st-stage disk failure that resulted in high-energy debris penetrating the engine cowling. Based on a preliminary analysis of this event, on March 21, 2020, the FAA issued Emergency AD 2020-07-51, which requires the removal from service of certain HPT 1st-stage disks installed on IAE V2522-A5, V2524-A5, V2525-D5, V2527-A5, V2527EA5, V2527M-A5, V2528-D5, V2530-A5, and V2533-A5 model turbofan engines.Since the FAA issued AD 2020-07-51, the manufacturer conducted a root cause analysis and identified a different population of HPT 1st-stage and HPT 2nd-stage disks that are affected by the unsafe condition and require removal from service. This condition, if not addressed, could result in failure of the HPT, uncontained HPT failure, damage to the engine, damage to the airplane, and loss of the airplane. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.AD RequirementsThis AD requires the removal from service of certain HPT 1st-stage and HPT 2nd-stage disks installed on IAE V2500-A1, V2522-A5, V2524-A5, V2525-D5, V2527-A5, V2527E-A5, V2527MA5, V2528-D5, V2530-A5, V2531-E5, and V2533-A5 model turbofan engines.

A Carpatair Saab 2000, registration YR-SBK performing flight V3-2385 from Craiova to Timisoara (Romania) with 51 passengers and 4 crew, was accelerating for takeoff around 11:00L (09:00Z) when the aircraft veered right off the runway, came to a stop off the runway and was evacuated. One passenger received leg injuries, another one head injuries during the evacuation, both were taken to a hospital. The airport reported the aircraft was taking off in low visibility when the aircraft went off the runway about half way down the 2500 meter long runway. Two passengers were taken to hospital, the aircraft received damage to gear and both propellers. Snow removal had been underway throughout the day.The airline reported the aircraft veered off the runway after the right hand main gear went through a snow bank on the runway, none of the occupants received any injuries. The damage to the aircraft is being assessed.Some time in the past Romania's CIAS released their final report concluding the probable causes of the accident were:Human error generated by following facts:- The take-off conditions exceeded the training level of the crew.- The changing of the take-off procedure, without previous training.Favorable cause: - inappropriate runway snow removal.The CIAS summarized the sequence of events:The aircraft was parked at Craiova Airport. The aircraft was prepared for the flight and, after the passengers boarding, it rolled on the taxiway B and, then, on the runway in order to align and to take off from the runway 09. The taking-off conditions were with low to medium snow, the taking-off surface being covered with a layer of dry snow. After the successive snow runway removal actions, in the lateral areas of the declared runway, including the line of the bright light marking lamps, there were snow accumulations of about 1 m.The aircraft was aligned on the runway in order to takeoff and, after getting the approval, it began the roll in order to takeoff. During the roll the aircraft deviated laterally to the right side, it hit the snow bank with the right engine propeller, formed after removing the snow from the runway, and it went out in the runway strip almost 20m.After the aircraft stopped, the crew proceeded to the emergency evacuation of persons on board, according to the specific procedures. The captain (43, ATPL, 6,623 hours total) informed TWR and requested emergency assistance.The persons on board left the aircraft through the emergency exists.The aircraft sustained substantial damage, all propeller blades on both propeller had separated, there was damage to the nose section and forward section of the fuselage amongst other damage to wing roots, gear bays and doors etc. The aircraft manufacturer stated the damage was repairable.The CIAS analysed:According to the information submitted to the crew, the weather conditions and the runway state were within the minimum standards set by the company for operating the aircraft type SAAB 2000.Based on the analyzed information it wasnt identified any aircraft failure that might have led to the occurrence of this incident.After the repeated snow removal from the runway, in order to maintain its state of operability, there resulted snow accumulations, which have been compacted.As a result of the deviation from the runway axis, to the right, during take-off, the engine no.2 (R/H) propeller blades touched the accumulated and compacted snow, were broken, losing the trust on engine no. 2 which generated a sudden turning to the right, the aircraft continuing to move almost perpendicular to the runway axis. Successively, the aircraft came into contact with the snow accumulation, with the right main landing gear leg, with the nose landing gear leg, then with the engine no. 1 (L/H) propeller blades, causing their rupture, ending with the left main landing gear leg. The asymmetry of the traction generated by successive blades ruptures of the two propellers could not be countered by the crew in due time. The aircraft stopped at almost 30 m laterally right side on the runway strip.Taking into consideration the indications from Chap. 7 of the ICAO Doc 9137, Part II, the snow from the runway was not removed appropriately, the lighting lamps being covered with snow, and the snow removal was not homogenous all over the runway surface. Furthermore there were no positions markers of the runway side lamps required by Romanian civil aeronautical regulation RACR-AD-PETA, section 5.5.4.11 - 5.5.4.3 and ICAO Doc 9137 Part II.The lack of markers, in front of runway side lamps, determined that the lateral delimitation of the runway through snow removal not to be rectilinear and parallel to the runway axis. The aircraft crew, who was not seeing the runway axle markings (covered by a thin snow layer), assumed, wrongly, that the snow accumulations (banks) represent two lines parallel with the runway axis.The captain changed the takeoff procedure in the moment when the aircraft was aligned for take-off, trying to adapt it to the existing conditions. The captain actually established new tasks for the copilot (29, CPL, 700 hours total), an operating mode that both were not familiar with. The flight recorders data show the existence, during the take-off process, of a short interval when both pilots read, simultaneously, the board indicators, successively announcing the reaching of the V1 speed.It is considered that none of the pilots could any longer maintain the take-off direction in relation to the chosen reference, in the given conditions (the time for adapting the sight, from inside the cabin to outside being longer than the one the crew had available at the moment). The take-off heading was kept until the proximity of V1, when the direction was lost, probably lacking reference points. The deviation to the right was accentuated by entering a runway section covered with 5-7 cm thick compacted snow, generating a differential braking on the landing gear wheels. This determined the impact with the snow banks, initially with the right propeller blades and left engine and the aircraft exit from the runway.The people onboard, the passengers and the crew members, left the aircraft according to the applicable emergency procedure for this aircraft type, jumping into the snow. The height, from which they jumped into the snow, leaving the aircraft, was 50  70 cm, depending on the emergency exit they used.Relevant NOTAM:A0331/12 - RWY 09/27 CLOSED. 13 FEB 10:24 2012 UNTIL 13 FEB 17:30 2012.

An Alitalia Airbus A320-200, registration EI-EIC performing flight AZ-204 from Rome Fiumicino (Italy) to London Heathrow,EN (UK), was accelerating for takeoff from Fiumicino's runway 25 when the crew observed a flock of birds, believed to be gulls, sitting on the runway and preparing for departure. The crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 74 knots over ground), the birds flew up and departed, while the crew brought the aircraft down to taxi speed, vacated the runway avoiding a bird strike, returned to the threshold runway 25 and departed without further conflict, from a then unoccupied runway, about 17 minutes after the rejected takeoff. The aircraft landed in London without further incident about 10 minutes past schedule.
A Pobeda Boeing 737-800, registration VQ-BTC performing flight DP-438 from Ufa to Moscow Vnukovo (Russia), was cleared to line up runway 32L and 39 seconds later was cleared for takeoff. The crew however queried ATC: "You sure?"An Azimuth Sukhoi Superjet 100-95, registration RA-89136 performing flight A4-129 from Mineralnye Vody to Ufa (Russia), had touched down on runway 32L 94 seconds prior to line up clearance for DP-438, rolled out and needed to backtrack the runway to taxi to the terminal. The aircraft was still on the runway when the takeoff clearance was issued, and vacated the runway only 157 seconds after touch down, about 22 seconds after DP-438 queried tower "You sure?"DP-438 received a renewed takeoff clearance and departed 46 seconds after receiving the first takeoff clearance.Metars:UWUU 011730Z 26003MPS CAVOK 08/06 Q1031 R32L/0///60 NOSIG=UWUU 011700Z 25004MPS 160V280 CAVOK 08/06 Q1031 R32L/0///60 NOSIG=UWUU 011630Z 26004MPS CAVOK 09/06 Q1031 R32L/0///60 NOSIG=UWUU 011600Z 26003MPS CAVOK 09/06 Q1031 R32L/0///60 NOSIG=UWUU 011530Z 25002MPS CAVOK 10/07 Q1031 R32L/0///60 NOSIG=UWUU 011500Z 25002MPS 210V270 CAVOK 10/06 Q1031 R32L/0///60 NOSIG=UWUU 011430Z 27001MPS CAVOK 12/06 Q1031 R32L/0///60 NOSIG=UWUU 011400Z 00000MPS CAVOK 13/07 Q1031 R32L/0///60 NOSIG=UWUU 011330Z 00000MPS CAVOK 16/08 Q1031 R32L/0///60 NOSIG=UWUU 011300Z 00000MPS CAVOK 18/08 Q1031 R32L/0///60 NOSIG=UWUU 011230Z VRB01MPS CAVOK 18/08 Q1031 R32L/0///60 NOSIG=UWUU 011200Z VRB01MPS CAVOK 18/08 Q1031 R32L/0///60 NOSIG=Map (Graphics: Google Earth):
A Jet2.com Boeing 737-800, registration G-DRTN performing flight LS-633 from East Midlands,EN (UK) to Tenerife South,CI (Spain) with 193 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from East Midland's runway 27 at 11:22L (11:22Z) in gusty conditions with the first officer being pilot flying and the captain (45, ATPL, 12,300 hours total, 893 hours on type), when at about reaching V1 the airspeed dropped significantly due to a gust and the aircraft began to veer right, estimated about 20-30 degrees off the runway centerline, prompting the commander to reject takeoff, take control of the aircraft and bringing it to a stop on the runway about 600 meters/2000 feet short of the runway end.On Dec 10th 2020 the UK AAIB released their bulletin concluding the probable cause of the serious incident was:The commander had a high workload managing the departure and, to give himself time, decided that the co-pilot should fly the take off. In very gusty wind conditions, the aircraft encountered a windshear event near V1 which caused a 13 kt reduction in airspeed. Additionally, the strength of the crosswind during takeoff caused the aircraft to veer right. Concerned that the aircraft might leave the runway, and considering the situation to be unsafe, the commander initiated an RTO five seconds after V1. The crew had not called V1, although the automatic callout had sounded. The SOP is to continue a takeoff when V1 has been reached because, as the manufacturer commented, successful outcomes are more likely when a takeoff is continued rather than rejected. In this case, the aircraft stopped on the runway with 600 m of runway remaining.The No 4 wheel and brake unit suffered heat damage from the full braking being applied during the RTO.The AAIB summarized the sequence of events:During the cockpit brief the crew refreshed the actions for the Windshear Escape Manoeuvre and a Rejected Takeoff (RTO). The calculated performance figures for the departure were V1 134 kt, VR 149 kt, VRMAX1 158 kt and V2 156 kt. Actions in the event of windshear at various stages of the takeoff were discussed along with the implications of windshear performance calculations. The aircraft had fuel loaded in excess of the planned requirement, so the crew decided to start and taxi to the departure end of the runway to await a suitable weather opportunity for takeoff. They had seen similar aircraft from other operators departing. The wind direction was relatively steady, and the pilots had calculated the maximum wind speed and direction that would give a crosswind component of 25 kt, which was 210⁰ at 29 kt. They passed this figure to ATC. As the aircraft approached the A1 holding point for Runway 27, the pilots were cleared for takeoff and were passed a wind of 220⁰ at 32 kt. The pilots confirmed that this was in limit by referring to their Electronic Flight Bag (EFB). The aircraft lined up on the runway without stopping and takeoff thrust was selected.At approximately 120 kt, the commander recalled a transitory reduction in airspeed of between 10 and 15 kt. He called this to the co-pilot but, as the acceleration resumed, decided to continue. The commander stated that approaching V1 (134 kt) the aircraft deviated dramatically from the centreline to the right. He estimated the deviation was between 20° and 30° of heading. The commander saw a large downtrend on his airspeed indication and felt that the co-pilots attempts to control the heading were ineffective. He stated to the investigation, as PM, my instant snapshot was that indicated airspeed was reducing and we were below V1, so I called Stop. During this sequence of events both pilots recalled hearing the automated V1 callout. The commander took control in accordance with Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), the RTO actions were carried out and the aircraft stopped on the runway centreline between M and H taxiways (Figure 1), with approximately 600 m remaining. Once the aircraft stopped, the commander made a public address announcement to alert the cabin crew, and the pilots had a brief discussion regarding subsequent actions. They decided that they were able to vacate the runway and informed ATC of that decision, while also suggesting a runway inspection because the commander was concerned the aircraft may have struck runway edge lights. ATC did not deploy the airport fire service and the pilots did not ask for such assistance. The pilots decided to return to stand and were cleared by ATC to do so. After the RTO, the commander was concerned about the co-pilot, who appeared to be preoccupied about what had happened during the takeoff. During the taxi in the commander believed that at least one brake was binding and that greater than normal thrust was required to taxi.On the stand the aircraft was shut down as normal with the exception that, as soon as a tug and towbar were connected, the commander released the parking brake. He liaised with the cabin crew, company operations and the duty Pilot Base Manager, and the decision was taken to disembark the passengers because company engineering advised it would require a wait of one hour before they could commence work on the wheels. An engineering investigation revealed damage to the No 4 wheel and brake unit. The damaged brake unit was replaced, as were all wheels and tyres in accordance with the operators maintenance manual.The AAIB analysed:The weather conditions during the event were severe and the aircraft was being operated to the limits in the operators documentation. The operators guidance states that the commander should take account of wind/gust conditions, pilot experience, runway width and surface conditions in deciding who should operate. In this case the co-pilot had three times more hours on type than the commander, was more familiar with EMA, and was permitted to operate to the same limits as the commander. The commander considered that allowing the co-pilot to operate the aircraft was within the operators guidance and would allow him to focus more of his attention on managing the preparation for departure.During the aircrafts takeoff roll, there was a 13 kt reduction in airspeed prior to V1. The commander noted the reduction and informed the co-pilot. It was short lived and as the acceleration in airspeed resumed the commander decided to continue. At this stage of the takeoff, windshear is not one of the manufacturers RTO criteria and neither predictive nor reactive windshear warnings or cautions would be expected.As the aircraft passed V1 the automated callout sounded, but immediately thereafter the airspeed decayed, the aircraft yawed rapidly right away from the centreline and there was a noticeable change in the lateral g. The commander was concerned the aircraft could exit the runway and considered the situation to be unsafe. He had seen the reduced airspeed with the associated downward trend indication, which occurred approximately five seconds before V1, and called Stop to reject the takeoff. The RTO actions were promptly and correctly carried out along with rapid control inputs to return the aircraft to the centreline.There are many factors to be considered by crews in deciding whether to continue or reject a takeoff in windshear conditions, but the manufacturers comments show that successful outcomes are more likely when the takeoff is continued rather than rejected. Windshear causes the relationship between airspeed and distance travelled along the runway to be altered unpredictably leading to doubt about the continued validity of performance calculations.In this case, in addition to windshear, the commander had to contend with the fact, and the startling effect, of the aircraft swinging off the centreline immediately after V1. Both pilots recalled hearing the V1 auto callout, but they did not call it themselves, and the operator wondered whether the lack of a spoken cue might have meant the pilots hand remained on the thrust levers. Removing the physical connection to the thrust levers at V1 is intended to remove the possibility that pilots will instinctively or impulsively close the levers in response to an adverse event. If the pilot did keep his hand on the thrust levers, it might have made it more likely that he would take the option to reject the takeoff.The manufacturer commented that the commander has sole responsibility for a decision to reject or continue a takeoff and must determine the safest course of action based on many factors. It was also stressed that guidance in the QRH was not intended to imply that stopping could be initiated above V1. In this case, however, although the RTO commenced above V1, the commander brought the aircraft under control and stopped on the runway with 600 m remaining. Following the RTO, the brakes would have been in the caution band for temperature. In these circumstances, the QRH Non-Normal Manoeuvres section contains guidance for pilots, such as to review the brake cooling schedule and consider whether there is a need for remote parking. In the event, however, this information was not considered, and the aircraft taxied to a normal stand despite there being slight binding in the brakes. It appeared likely that preoccupation with what had just happened and concerns for the co-pilots wellbeing distracted the commander from considering the QRH guidance.Metars:EGNX 091320Z 25043G58KT 3500 R27/0050 +RAGS TS SQ SCT010CB BKN013 06/06 Q0979 RETS=EGNX 091250Z 20031G43KT 9999 -RA BKN015 13/10 Q0977=EGNX 091220Z 21033G46KT 9999 BKN015 13/10 Q0978=EGNX 091120Z 21037G48KT 9999 -RA BKN016 12/10 Q0980=EGNX 091050Z 21040G56KT 9000 -RA BKN016 13/10 Q0981=EGNX 091020Z 21039G57KT 9999 BKN017 13/10 Q0981=EGNX 090950Z 20038G56KT 9999 -RA BKN015 12/10 Q0980 RERA=EGNX 090920Z 20037G49KT 9999 BKN014 12/10 Q0981=EGNX 090850Z 20036G52KT 9999 -RA BKN012 12/09 Q0983=Flight Data Momitoring Extract (Graphics: AAIB):
A Swiss Avro RJ-100, registration HB-IXP performing flight LX-446 from Geneva (Switzerland) to London City,EN (UK) with 73 passengers and 5 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from runway 05 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed due to a strong odour of oil appearing in the cockpit. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The flight was cancelled.The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground for about 63 hours before resuming service.Switzerland's SUST reported both flight crew received minor injuries by intoxication. An investigation has been opened.The SUST released their summary report in French only (Editorial note: to serve the purpose of global prevention of the repeat of causes leading to an occurrence an additional timely release of all occurrence reports in the only world spanning aviation language English would be necessary, a French only release does not achieve this purpose as set by ICAO annex 13 and just forces many aviators to waste much more time and effort each in trying to understand the circumstances leading to the occurrence. Aviators operating internationally are required to read/speak English besides their local language, investigators need to be able to read/write/speak English to communicate with their counterparts all around the globe).The SUST analyses and concludes (in one):The APU was out of service, the crew therefore used the bleed air from engines #1 (outboard left) and #4 (outboard right) to provide air conditioning on board of the aircraft. The temperature control valve of the oil circuit of the #1 engine was leaking, as the valve is located above the engine's bleed band, the oil such leaked by gravity onto the bleed band from where the oil entered the engine's compressor. The bleed air from the #1 engine had been selected on about 15 minutes prior to takeoff, during taxi at low power the bleed air ducts connecting the #1 engine to the #1 pack became gradually contamined with oil. Upon applying takeoff power the flow of hot and compressed air greatly increased in the already contamined bleed air ducts causing contaminated air to arrive in the cockpit prompting the captain to reject takeoff.As the temperature control valve (TCV) was clearly identified as cause of the occurrence, the SUST does not continue the investigation further and concludes the report with this summary.The SUST reported the aircraft taxied to the holding point runway 05 with the APU inoperative, bleed air being supplied by engines #1 and #4 (bleed air valves of engines #2 and #3 were closed). While accelerating through 70 KIAS for takeoff both pilots noticed the smell of burnt oil. The smell increased further prompting the captain to reject takeoff at about 90 KIAS. The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway, emergency services responded and escorted the aircraft to the apron. The captain requests the purser to enter the cockpit, the purser confirms the smell of burnt oil has also been detected in the cabin. The engines were shut down normally, the passengers disembarked normally. Medical services entered the cockpit and determined both pilots and the purser had been poisoned by carbon monoxide inhalation. The pilots and purser were taken to a hospital and discharged about 7.5 hours later.Location of bleed band and temperature control valve (Photo: SUST):
A Volotea Boeing 717-200, registration EI-EXB performing flight V7-2506 from Montpellier to Strasbourg (France), was on final approach to Strasbourg's runway 05.A HOP! Canadair CRJ-700, registration F-GRZG performing flight A5-3526 from Strasbourg to Marseille (France), was cleared for takeoff from runway 05.When the Boeing 717 reached about 1.5nm before the runway threshold the crew initiated a go around due to the CRJ-700 still in the takeoff run. Subsequently both aicraft climbed out and lost separation.The French BEA reported the separation reduced to 100 feet vertical at 0.4nm horizontal distance. The occurrence was rated a serious incident (category near collision) and is being investigated. TCAS resolution advisories activated in both aircraft, the CRJ-700 was instructed to climb and the B712 to level off at about 2300 feet. After being clear of conflict the CRJ-700 continued to Marseille for a landing without further incident, the B712 positioned for another approach to runway 05 and landed safely.On Nov 20th 2020 the BEA released their final report concluding the probable causes of the serious incident were:The following factors may have contributed to the crew of the CRJ700 being issued with an immediate take-off clearance although the Boeing 717 was at 3 NM on final approach:- The LOC controllers wish to optimize the use of the runway, without any particular reason and without anticipating the risks in the event of something unexpected happening, meant that the prescribed separations between the arriving and departing aircraft were not complied with.- At the time of the incident, the absence of means, practices or systematic procedures at Strasbourg Entzheim airport, such as the setting up of an approach fix for runway 05.- The aircraft type not being mentioned by the LOC controller when giving the traffic information to the crew of the CRJ700 with a view to an immediate take-off. This meant that the crew did not have all the information to allow them to judge whether they could guarantee the immediate take-off conditions and did not share the same situational awareness with the controller and the crew of the Boeing 717.The following factors may have contributed to the activation of the TCAS resolution advisory between the CRJ700 which was taking off and the Boeing 717 which was in a go-around:- The LOC controller not anticipating and developing action plans in the event of a potential conflict following a low-level missed approach or a delay with the immediate take-off.- The situational awareness between the LOC controller and the two crews not being shared.- The initial paths for the departure and missed approach, to the NDB at 2,500 ft, not guaranteeing sufficient separation between the aircraft.The BEA released following safety lessons:One of the tasks of the airport controller is to expedite and maintain an orderly flow of air traffic. He may do this by approaching the regulatory minima when this is necessary, but this should not be done systematically due to the ensuing risk of exceeding them. Thus, the optimization of the use of the runway and the search for operational efficiency must not take precedence over the prevention of collisions which requires the controller to continuously carry out a strategic analysis of the risks.After an in-flight incident, it is particularly complex for a captain to synthesize the useful information to explain it and continue the flight. The emotional load makes it difficult to be objective about the incident that has occurred, even if there are no more consequences for the rest of the flight, for both the flight crew and the cabin crew. Sharing information with the crew can, however, affect certain crew members according to their sensitivity and their experience. The BEA summarized the sequence of events:The crew of the Boeing 717, operating the Volotea flight from Montpellier Méditerranée (Hérault), were carrying out an ILS approach to runway 05 (QFU 047) at Strasbourg Entzheim airport. Exchanges between the controller and the crew were in English. At 13:01, the LOC controller asked the crew to continue the approach, indicating that they were number two behind a light aircraft on the downwind leg for runway 05. Four minutes later, the captain of the CRJ700 operating the HOP! flight bound for Marseille Provence (Bouches-du-Rhône), and PM, contacted the LOC controller, at the GND controllers request, to advise that they were approaching holding point H and that they were ready for departure from runway 05. The exchanges between the controller and the CRJ700 crew were in French. At 13:05:14, the LOC controller asked them if they were ready to take off within the minute and gave them traffic information about an aircraft at 3 NM on final approach without specifying that it was a Boeing 717. The PM of the CRJ700 accepted and at 13:05:23, the LOC controller cleared them for an immediate take-off from runway 05 (point 1).The Boeing 717 was around 3 NM from the runway threshold on final approach at an altitude of 1,650 ft(4) and an indicated airspeed of 136 kt when the CRJ700 was around 30 m before holding point H. At 13:05:46, the captain of the Boeing 717, PM, announced that they were at 2 NM on final approach. The crew of the CRJ700 lined up on runway 05. The LOC controller informed the crew of the Boeing 717 of the departure of the CRJ700 and asked them to continue the approach. The PM of the Boeing 717 said unbelievable on the frequency. Five seconds later, the crew of the CRJ700 started the take-off run (point 2).At 0.90 NM from the threshold of runway 05, at an altitude of 890 ft and an indicated airspeed of 138 kt, the PM of the Boeing 717 informed the LOC controller that they may interrupt the approach. The LOC controller told the crew to continue the approach. Nine seconds later, at 13:06:28, at 0.58 NM from the threshold of runway 05 at a height of 240 ft (40 ft below the decision height (DH) ), the crew of the Boeing 717 initiated a missed approach and announced this on the frequency. The CRJ700 was still on the runway at 0.42 NM (780 m) from the threshold of runway 05 at a speed of around 115 kt (point 3). The LOC controller asked the PM of the Boeing 717, who read this back, to keep straight ahead during the missed approach. The PF selected heading 042° and the Boeing 717 started to deviate to the left of the runway centreline. When the HOP! CRJ700 flew over threshold 23 at an altitude of 900 ft and a speed of 160 kt, the separation with the Boeing 717, whose speed was 163 kt and accelerating, was around 1 NM horizontally and 920 ft vertically (point 4).The LOC controller asked (point 5) the crew of CRJ700, at an altitude of 1,300 ft and climbing to 6,000 ft to directly turn left towards MIRGU, the last standard instrument departure point (SID)(5), and the crew of the Boeing 717, at an altitude of 2,300 ft and climbing to 2,500 ft, to immediately turn right to heading 050° (point 6). The CRJ700 started turning at 2,100 ft. The horizontal and vertical separations between the aeroplanes were respectively 0.6 NM and 300 ft. The speed of the Boeing 717 was 60 kt higher than that of the CRJ700. The LOC controller asked the crew of the CRJ700 to stop climbing at 2,000 ft. The PM of the CRJ700 asked him to repeat the instruction. The CRJ700 flew through 2,400 ft and was climbing with a vertical speed of around 1,300 ft/min and the Boeing 717 was stable at 2,500 ft. At the same time, the TCAS of the two aeroplanes transmitted traffic advisories (TA). The LOC controller replied to the PM of the CRJ700 by telling him to immediately stop climbing at 2,000 ft. A second later, resolution advisories (RA) were generated on board each plane: MAINTAIN CLIMB for the CRJ700 and DESCENT for the Boeing 717 (points 7). The horizontal and vertical separations between the two aeroplanes were respectively 0.40 NM and 50 ft. The resolution advisory (RA) of the CRJ700 was reinforced to INCREASE CLIMB and the PF increased the rate of climb. Five seconds later, the separations were 0.28 NM and 95 ft. The minimum horizontal distance between the two aeroplanes of 0.17 NM was reached five seconds later with a vertical separation of 500 ft.At 13:07:55, the path conflict had ended and the two crews continued their flights (point 8).The BEA analysed with respect to the use of English:The use of just English might have meant that the crew of the Boeing 717 were aware of the character of the instructions given in French to the crew of the CRJ700, and allowed them to adapt their path accordingly and thus avoid the activation of the TCAS resolution advisories.However, it is not possible to determine if the monitoring of the few exchanges which followed the take-off clearance, made by the crew of the CRJ700 during the take-off run, would have resulted in better situational awareness if only English had been used.The BEA analysed with respect to the crews:Crew of Boeing 717-200The crew specified that it was the fourth and last rotation of the day and that they were running around one hour late due to a technical problem which had occurred between the second and third rotation.The captain, of Spanish nationality, and the first officer, of French nationality, indicated that they heard the clearance to take-off given to the crew of the CRJ700 when the aeroplane had not yet arrived at the holding point. They were at around 3 NM from the threshold of runway 05. They found the CRJ700 a bit slow in lining up. At this point, they knew they would have to execute a missed approach taking into account a potential conflict in the initial climb. The weather conditions did not provide any difficulty. The captain was irritated by the way the situation was being managed as there were only two aeroplanes in the circuit. On approaching the DH, when the controller told them to Continue and the CRJ700 was still on the first third of the runway, the crew initially started a missed approach in manual control. The reason behind the selection of heading 042°, different from the runway magnetic heading, could not be explained.The crew were expecting to turn right in order to avoid a conflict with the departing CRJ700 (which should turn left according to the standard departure procedure) but the controller asked them to keep straight ahead. They had to climb to an altitude of 2,500 ft. The first officer remained concentrated on the management of the path. The captain did not understand the controllers instructions given in French to the crew of the CRJ700 who were of French nationality. He was surprised that, in a potential conflict situation, the exchanges were not carried out in a shared language, in English only. Neither of the two crew members had visual contact with the CRJ700.The first officer disconnected the autopilot in order to follow the TCAS resolution advisories. The pilots said that the orders were consistent with what they had already practised in simulation sessions. Nevertheless, the situation was dangerous and they had been afraid. They saw the CRJ700 pass in front of them in a left-hand climbing turn.Crew of CRJ700The crew indicated that they were concentrated on the actions and technical calls with a view to lining up and carrying out a rolling take-off. Even though there had been a lot of exchanges in English between the LOC controller and the crew of the Boeing 717, they were not aware that it was on final approach. They thought that the traffic mentioned by the controller, when they were asked whether they were ready to depart within the minute, was a local flight or a runway circuit under VFR.While climbing through 2,450 ft, the controller asked the crew to maintain 2,000 ft and the crew made a slight nose-down input. At the same time, the TCAS was activated, transmitting a MAINTAIN CLIMB and then INCREASE CLIMB resolution advisory. The indication on the aeroplanes vertical speed indicator required a high vertical climb speed (fully up), the dial of the vertical speed indicator being mainly red. The pilots were very surprised to have to take such a pitch attitude for the climb. They had been afraid and had expected to strike an aircraft. At this point, the crew were not aware that the Boeing 717 had executed a missed approach. The pilots specified that they had never had visual contact with the Boeing.Shortly after the incident and not realising how it might affect the cabin crew, the flight crew explained to the cabin crew who had entered the cockpit, what had happened during the take-off.Incapacitation of a cabin crew member of the CRJ700The HOP! flight cabin crew were composed of a purser and another cabin crew member. They both perceived the abnormal situation shortly after take-off. The purser indicated that the other cabin crew member had joined him at the front of the aeroplane and that when the cockpit door was opened shortly after the incident, he saw that the faces of the two pilots were frozen. They had just requested an explanation from the approach controller. The captain then told them what had happened during the take-off and initial climb. The cabin crew member then recalled a serious incident which had occurred several years earlier when he had been a cabin crew member for another operator. The recollection of this memory greatly upset him. The purser noticed this, and informed the captain that the cabin crew member would no longer be able to carry out his tasks on both the flight underway and on the next flight (which as a consequence, gave rise to a limitation to 50 passengers).Regulations require that there is a complement of a minimum of one cabin crew for every 50 passengers. With 73 passengers on board, and one cabin crew member incapacitated, cabin safety might have been impeded.The BEA analysed the testimony of the tower controller:LOC controller experience and statementThe LOC controller holds an air traffic controller licence with aerodrome control instrument (aerodrome radar control and tower control) and approach control surveillance ratings. He is also a simulator and position instructor. Before joining Strasbourg Entzheim in 2012 where he was qualified in 2013, he was first qualified as controller at Bâle Mulhouse airport in 2001.The day of the incident he had started his shift in the LOC position at 12:30. He indicated that there must have been one or two VFR aircraft to be managed before the arrival of the CR700 and Boeing 717 crew on the frequency. He added that when the crew of the CRJ700 contacted him ready for departure on the LOC frequency, the CRJ700 was, according to him, nearly at holding point H and the Boeing 717 was stabilized on final approach to 05 at around 3.5 NM from the runway threshold. The LOC controller did not think that proposing an immediate take-off would give rise to any particular problem. The LOC controller considered that based on the decided tone of voice of the crew member of the CRJ700, the latter had clearly understood the constraint and that he shared the same understanding of the situation. The LOC controller considered that the CRJ700 had not lined up as quickly as hoped.When the CRJ700 left the ground, the LOC controller considered that the Boeing 717 could land. He waited before giving the clearance to land to check the spacing. He confirmed that he would have been required to clear the crew of the Boeing 717 to land before the CRJ700 had crossed the end of the runway. He was surprised by the decision of the Boeing 717 crew to execute a missed approach. He added that in his opinion it was more dangerous to execute a missed approach behind the departing aeroplane than to land a bit too close behind it.The LOC controller indicated that he did not wish to disturb the crew of the Boeing 717 during the execution of the missed approach. He thus asked them to keep straight ahead and asked the crew of the CRJ700 to turn towards the last SID point to ensure the separation. He added that he was convinced at this point that the crew of the CRJ700 were perfectly aware of the situation as they had been cleared for an immediate departure and had had the position information about the traffic in final approach. The LOC controller indicated that he had waited to have radar contact with the CRJ700 as visually, with the parallax, it was not easy for him to know its position. The radar blip appeared at around 1,600 ft and the LOC controller explained that it seemed to take a long time for it to appear. He added that when the CRJ700 appeared on the radar screen, his heart jumped: the Boeing 717 had deviated to the left of the runway centreline and not the CRJ700. The LOC controller thus saw that his instructions had not had the desired effect. This was an emergency situation for the LOC controller, which was not improving as there was a contradiction with the instructions he had given. The LOC controller considered that the crew of the CRJ700 were not at all on alert as they asked him to repeat the message to stop climbing. He then repeated the altitude limitation, this time using the emergency phraseology.The LOC controller heard the crew of the Boeing 717 express their discontent on the frequency in this lapse of time and he considered that this contributed to increasing his emotional load. He asked the Boeing 717 crew to turn to heading 050° but he realised that this heading would not change anything as it was that of the runway centreline. During the TCAS resolution, he took no action, which is normal procedure and left the crews to manage the situation. He then transferred the two aeroplanes to the approach frequency.The LOC controller indicated furthermore that:- He had probably built up confidence from the day before when he had managed a lot of VFR traffic with the Aero 2019 general aviation air show at Friedrichshafen. He thought that this could have influenced his decision.- He thought that the two crews were fully aware of the situation and that they had the same situational awareness as him.- He thought that he was ready to manage this type of situation (due to, in particular, feedback and discussions with his colleagues) but ultimately, he realised that this was not the case and that he had little time to detect, analyse and decide in such a situation.- He had the impression that seconds were lost because he could not see the radar blip of the CRJ700 on his screen which would not have been the case at Bâle-Mulhouse where he had worked.- The rhythm at Bâle-Mulhouse where he had worked previously was higher than at Strasbourg Entzheim.The BEA reported Eurocontrol had conducted a study in low height go arounds (from below 400 feet AGL) and found that only 8 of 187 occurrences resulted in conflicts. Of these 8 occurrences only "providence" prevented a midair collision in two occurrences. Eurocontrol identified 6 scenarios which could lead to a low height go around and listed measures for:- prevent conflicts before or after low height go arounds- mitigate the collision risk after low height go aroundMap (Graphics: BEA):
A Transavia France Boeing 737-800, registration F-GZHO performing flight TO-3010 from Paris Orly (France) to Marrakech (Morocco), was accelerating through 90 KIAS for takeoff from Orly's runway 24 when the crew received a message "IAS DISAGREE". The crew elected to continue takeoff, the aircraft was in the initial climb when the crew received messages "AOA DISAGREE" and "ALT DISAGREE". The crew stopped the climb at FL090 and returned to Paris for a safe landing on Orly's runway 26 about 40 minutes after departure.The French BEA rated the occurrence an incident and opened an investigation. The BEA reported that a post flight inspection revealed an AoA probe had failed. The previous evening, while enroute on a ferry flight from Norwich,EN (UK) to Orly following maintenance in Norwich the AoA probe had encountered a first failure.On Feb 28th 2018 the NTSB announced they have assigned an accredited representative for the state of design and manufacture of the aircraft and aircraft components to join the investigation led by the BEA.On Nov 16th 2020 the BEA released their final report reporting, a similiar occurrence on a ferry flight of Feb 7th 2018 was included in the same report, and concluded the probable causes of both incidents were:The following factors contributed to the dysfunction of the right AOA sensor and the display of the IAS DISAGREE, AOA DISAGREE and ALT DISAGREE alerts during the take-off of the flights of 7 and 8 February.- The contamination of resolver 2 of the right AOA sensor by a solvent which led to a failure of the resolver and erroneous speed and altitude indications, followed by the AOA, IAS and ALT DISAGREE alerts. The investigation was not able to determine the cause of this contamination which seems to be an isolated case nor the reason why this defect, present since the installation of the sensor on the aeroplane, led to the activation of the alerts during a post maintenance flight. However, it is possible that the handling of the sensor during maintenance exacerbated the dysfunction without the technicians realising this.- The technician working on the aeroplane between the two flights not using the FIM. Its use would have ensured that a more complete check was carried out, the failure would have probably been detected and the sensor replaced.The BEA analysed:The Boeing 737-800, registered F-GZHO, was delivered new to Transavia and put into service on 9 February 2015. It had logged 8,927 flight hours for 4,397 cycles on 7 February 2018 and had just come out of a C-type maintenance inspection carried out by KLM UK Engineering in Norwich (United Kingdom). One of the maintenance operations carried out during this inspection required the two AOA sensors to be manually turned by 30°. The technicians who had carried out this operation had not noticed any anomaly.Transavia France indicated that this sensor (manufactured in 2014) had not been disassembled from the aeroplane since its delivery to the company. The crew of the flight of 7 February contacted the company during the flight to report the failure. A technician, employed by a subcontractor of the company which Transavia used for the maintenance of its planes, worked on the plane during the night. He explained that the only information that he had was that recorded in the AFL in which the crew mentioned the three IAS DISAGREE, AOA DISAGREE and ALT DISAGREE alerts. He tried to obtain more details about the event from the prime contractor maintenance company but the latter was unable to give him further information.He therefore complied with the AMM procedures concerning the inspection of AOA sensors, Pitot probes and static pressure ports and the stall warning and did not observe anything abnormal. He added that the AOA sensor moved freely. He explained that he did not consult the procedures in the Fault Isolation Manual (FIM) corresponding to each alert but that the actions that he carried out ultimately corresponded to what was required by the FIM. He nevertheless specified that the FIM procedure for the AOA DISAGREE alert requires the SMYDC(12) to be tested in order to check whether it has recorded a failure and that he had not thought to do this. The SMYDC test carried out the next day, at the end of the second flight, revealed error messages concerning an AOA sensor anomaly requiring its replacement.The technician explained that an AOA sensor failure is usually accompanied by an Autoslat Fail alert and that this alert was not reported by the crew. He thought that the AOA sensor might have iced which could explain why he had not detected any problem. The aeroplane was therefore returned to service for the flight of the following day....Transavia provided the BEA with all the flight data recorded by the aeroplanes maintenance recorder (QAR) since March 2015.The analysis of this flight data brought to light that the dysfunction of the right AOA sensor gradually evolved over time with the values changing in increasingly longer steps compared to the left AOA sensor where the changes are a lot more dynamic. The following figures show the evolution of the AOA sensor dysfunction between 2015 and 2018 based on the recordings of the values provided by the left and right AOA sensors.The start of this dysfunction can be detected in the QAR data as early as March 2015, just a few weeks after the aeroplane had been delivered to Transavia. The dysfunction then becomes significantly more marked and is visible up to the last flight before the maintenance work in Norwich. There is then a clear change in the behaviour of the angle of attack values recorded during the flights of 7 and 8 February and the dysfunction is less visible.The activation of the AOA DISAGREE alert cannot be checked using the QAR data of the occurrence flight: the AOA DISAGREE alert is generated by comparing the values measured by resolver 2 of each sensor whereas the recorded angle of attack value may come from resolver 1, depending on the SMYDC selection logic. It is therefore probable that the difference between the resolver 2s before 7 February was not sufficient to activate an alert and that this difference increased during the flight of 7 February although the difference between the resolver 1s had decreased.The faulty sensor was removed from the aircraft and sent to KLM EM(16) in Amsterdam for tests and disassembly in the presence of the BEA. The examination found damage to several internal components. The gears between the two resolvers were damaged and at ambient temperature, the shaft of resolver 2 was blocked in rotation and was slightly deformed. At operating temperature, reached after the vane heater test, the two resolvers gave indications which differed from each other by around 100°. Resolver 2 was sent to the manufacturer of the AOA sensor, Collins Aerospace, who coordinated an examination with its subcontractor, MOOG, the resolver supplier. The examination of the resolver blocked in rotation found the presence of a viscous and tacky substance, between its stator and rotor, which prevented the relative movement of these two parts.The Collins and Transavia historical records concerning the two AOA sensors on the aircraft indicate that no maintenance actions were carried out after delivery of the units to Boeing in February 2015. Therefore, it is possible that the viscous substance was introduced during the manufacturing process. It was not possible to determine, however, if the viscous substance found within the resolver was present from when either the resolver or the sensor was manufactured or if it was caused by exposure to an external environment after delivery.Examinations carried out by Collins Aerospace and MOOG found that this substance was composed primarily of epoxy resin, used in the manufacture of resolvers (winding) but contaminated with one or more other substances....In the two incidents, the pilots did not immediately carry out the memory items. In both cases, they first tried to identify the side which was supplying the erroneous information and initially used this assessment to continue the flight with the automatic systems engaged.They did not set the recommended pitch attitude and thrust parameters. They indicated that they knew the applicable procedure well but that during take-off, the selected thrust and the pitch attitude of around 15° allowed the aeroplane to climb safely. They did not think it was opportune to reduce the pitch attitude and thrust in a critical flight phase such as the initial climb. They added that during simulator exercises with respect to the Airspeed Unreliable procedure, certain company instructors recommended to pilots to keep the pitch attitude of 15° and the take-off thrust in initial climb....The captain of the flight of 7 February indicated that neither he nor the first officer mentioned out loud the difference in speed that they had observed when 80 kt was called out. He had not considered the situation dangerous and had not envisaged rejecting the take-off. He added that the VMC conditions had facilitated the management of the occurrence and that he would have perhaps reacted differently in IMC conditions.During the flight of 8 February, the pilots had had time to talk and the instructor and captain asked the pilot in training if he was happy to continue the take-off despite the difference of 10 kt. The latter indicated that in retrospect he would have been very willing to reject the take-off but that the way the question was asked pushed him to reply in the affirmative. He specified that having joined the company very recently, he did not feel comfortable about contradicting the instructor.The instructor and captain explained that he had not had time to analyse the consequences of the difference in speeds displayed on the PFDs for the rest of the flight and that he had not considered the situation dangerous when the IAS DISAGREE was activated. In retrospect, he thought that it would have been preferable to reject the take-off. He specified that it was the first time that he had been confronted with the occurrence of a failure between 80 kt and V1.
A Wizz Air UK Airbus A321-200, registration G-WUKJ performing flight W9-807 from Doncaster Sheffield,EN to London Stansted,EN (UK), was accelerating for takeoff from Doncaster's runway 20 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed due to unreliable airspeed indications. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The AAIB reported the aircraft was to depart for its first flight after long term storage when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed due to unreliable airspeed indications. The occurrence was rated a serious incident, an investigation has been opened.On Sep 13th 2020 the NTSB announced they have assigned an accredited representative, representing the state of design and manufacture of the flight data management unit, to join the investigation by the AAIB.On Nov 12th 2020 the AAIB released their bulletin stating the aircraft had put into long term parking on Mar 25th 2020. On Jun 9th 2020 the air data system was flushed in accordance with the long term parking requirements. On Jun 15th 2020 works to return the aircraft to service began. The AAIB summarized the sequence of events:On 16 June 2020, the aircraft was released to service for a non-revenue flight to Stansted. As the aircraft had been on the ground for an extended period, the commander and first officer decided to complete separate walkarounds as a precaution; they found no faults.Shortly after 1030 hrs, the flight crew prepared the aircraft for flight, taxied to the holding point and were given clearance to takeoff on Runway 20. The commander reported that, during the initial acceleration, his Primary Flight Display (PFD) trend arrow indicated an increasing airspeed. As the aircraft continued to accelerate his attention was drawn to a number of birds that were in the takeoff path. When his instrument scan returned to the PFD he identified that the speed indication was reading zero. He immediately cross checked with the first officer and called to reject the takeoff. Maximum reverse thrust and automatic braking were applied and the aircraft stopped on the runway. The pilot reported that takeoff was rejected at 120 kt, which was also V1.The AAIB reported with respect to the examination of the aircraft:The post flight report produced a failure message '34-12-34 ADR1' associated with a flight control ECAM warning in the No 1 Air Data Reference (ADR1). Troubleshooting performed by the AMO transposed the No 1 and No 3 Air Data Inertial Reference Units (ADIRUs) and after a successful ground test, released the aircraft for the ferry flight. During the subsequent takeoff, at approximately 1540 hrs, the aircraft performed a low speed rejected takeoff as the commanders PFD was still not registering an air speed.Further troubleshooting over the following two days finally found three small insect larvae, approximately the size of a grain of rice, within the No 1 pitot probe. These larvae were liberated whilst performing a pitot probe flush, which was advised by the aircraft manufacturer. The larvae were not retained to enable further identification of the insect species.The operator concluded that the insect larvae may have been deposited in the pitot probe whilst it was parked with the pitot probe covers fitted. To prevent differential pressure measurement issues in the air data system, pitot probe covers supplied by the aircraft manufacturer do not completely seal the probes, it is therefore possible that an insect could enter the air data system during prolonged parking. It cannot be ruled out, however, that the larvae were deposited once the aircraft had been prepared to return to service on 15 June or an insect had been within the pitot probe covers before they were fitted.Following safety actions were taken:The operator has introduced a requirement to flush all total and static pressure lines before any aircraft is returned to operation after it has been parked for more than three days.The operator is also looking to identify better pitot probe covers that may offer better protection than those currently used.The aircraft manufacturer is looking to update the aircraft AMM Return to Operations task to require air data system flushing prior to the next fl ight after prolonged time on the ground. 
An Azul Linhas Aereas Embraer ERJ-195, registration PR-AYY performing flight AD-4834 from Joinville,SC to Sao Paulo Viracopos,SP (Brazil) with 114 passengers and 5 crew, was accelerating for takeoff when birds collided with the nose gear and were ingested by the right hand engine (CF34). The crew rejected takeoff and returned to the apron.Brazil's CENIPA reported there were no injuries, the aircraft sustained minor damage. The occurrence was rated an incident and will not be investigated. 
An Aer Lingus Airbus A320-200, registration EI-DVJ performing flight EI-610 from Dublin (Ireland) to Amsterdam (Netherlands), was climbing out of Dublin's runway 28L when the crew declared PAN PAN reporting multiple bird strikes on rotation for takeoff and stopped the climb at 6000 feet. The crew reported increased vibrations on the right hand engine (CFM56), the engine is operating normally otherwise. Tower advised via approach that there had been a brief flame from the right hand engine. The aircraft returned to Dublin's runway 28L for a safe landing about 16 minutes after departure.A replacement A320-200 registration EI-DEJ reached Amsterdam with a delay of one hour.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Dublin about 22 hours after landing back.
A S7 Sibir Airlines Airbus A321-200, registration VP-BPO performing flight S7-5104 from Sochi to Novosibirsk (Russia) with 165 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Sochi's runway 24 when the crew needed to reject takeoff at about 80 KIAS when a bird was ingested by one of the engines (CFM56). The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.An inspection did not find any damage, the aircraft is currently preparing to depart Sochi and is estimated to reach Novosibirsk with a delay of 3 hours.
An Avianca Airbus A320-200 in retro livery, registration N284AV performing flight AV-8598 from Pasto to Bogota (Colombia), was rotating for takeoff from Pasto when the aircraft received damage to its right hand horizontal stabilizer and elevator. The aircraft climbed to FL340 and landed in Bogota without further incident about one hour later.The aircraft was taken out of service and is still on the ground in Bogota about 40 hours after landing.According to NOTAMs the runway is closed daily between 19:00Z to 11:00Z starting Sep 9th 2020 and estimated until December 8th 2020, probably for runway repair works. At the time of the occurrence the runway was officially open according to the NOTAMs.Local sources report the asphalt surface of runway 02/20 at Pasto is crumbling and detaching, the horizontal stabilizer was hit by detaching asphalt just as the aircraft rotated for departure.The previous day another occurrence happened at Pasto, see Incident: Avianca A320 at Pasto on Oct 27th 2020, hard landing and go around.Related NOTAM:A1628/20 NOTAMNQ) SKED/QMRLC/IV/NBO/A/000/999/0123N07717W010A) SKPS B) 2009092230 C) 2012081100D) DLY BTN 1900-2359 AND 0000-1100E) RWY 02/20 CLSDThe damage to the horizontal tailplane:
An Azul Linhas Aereas Embraer ERJ-195, registration PR-AYX performing flight AD-4186 from Tabatinga,AM to Manaus,AM (Brazil) with 68 passengers and 5 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Tabatinga, when the crew spotted a dog crossing the runway and rejected takeoff. While slowing the crew felt the impact of the dog against the nose gear. The aircraft slowed safely without further incident. Brazil's CENIPA reported the aircraft managed to stop within the runway limits and did not sustain any damage.The aircraft was able to depart about 2 hours later.
A Smartwings Boeing 737-800, registration OK-TVV performing flight QS-1019 from Cagliari (Italy) to Prague (Czech Republic) with 58 passengers and 7 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Cagliari's runway 14 when the crew felt vibrations from the nose gear shortly before reaching Vr. The crew continued takeoff, climbed to safe altitude and requested a runway inspection while continuing the departure. The runway inspection confirmed tyre debris on the runway confirming the crew's suspicion of a nose gear tyre damage. The crew elected to continue the flight to Prague, declared PAN PAN on approach to Prague and landed safely on Prague's runway 06 about 2 hours after departure. The aircraft vacated the runway and stopped for an inspection, the aircraft was subsequently towed to the apron.The damaged tyre (Photo: UZPLN):
A Flybondi Boeing 737-800, registration LV-HQY performing flight FO-5111 from Iguazu,MI to (Argentina), departed Iguazu's Catarates Airport's runway 31 at about 00:30L (Jul 16th 03:30Z) when the crew rejected takeoff after the aircraft experienced a pitch up event causing a tail strike.The aircraft had arrived as flight FO-5450 from Mendoza,MD to Iguazu,MI (Argentina) landing on Iguazu's Catarates Airport's runway 31 at about 23:28L (Jul 16th 02:28Z).The aircraft was due to depart as flight FO-5433 to Cordoba,CD (Argentina), the flight was cancelled however. According to Mode-S data the aircraft did not become airborne for that flight.Argentina's JIAAC reported LV-HQY suffered an incident at 03:30Z (Jul 16th), there were no injuries, the damage to the aircraft is being assessed. The JIAAC have opened an investigation into the occurence.It thus remained unclear whether the tail strike happened during landing on flight FO-5450 or on departure for flight FO-5433 which possibly could have prompted a rejected takeoff (which would have remained invisible to the Mode-S receiver in use). Aviation sources in Argentina are considering a mass and balance problem (which tend to lean towards the takeoff scenario as does the time stamp given by the JIAAC) and report structural damage.The airline reported a technical flaw in the takeoff process for flight FO-5433 to Cordoba forced the aircraft to return to the apron, the flight was cancelled.On Jul 18th 2018 Argentina's JIAAC released additional information stating that during the start of the takeoff phase the aircraft experienced a pitch up causing the rear lower area of the fuselage to contact the runway surface. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. The occurrence was rated an accident and is being investigated. On Nov 16th 2019 the JIAAC released an interim report in Spanish stating the aircraft was departing runway 31 for flight FO-5111 to El Palomar,BA (Argentina) with the first officer (53, ATPL, 2,746 hours total, 106 hours on type) being pilot flying, the training captain (59, ATPL, 7,100 hours total, 2,974 hours on type) was pilot monitoring and acting as instructor. While the aircraft accelerated the aircraft suddenly experienced a pitch up event, the tail contacted the runway surface, prompting the crew to reject takeoff. The accident happened in visual meteorologic and night conditions.The JIAAC reported the aircraft had undergone a reconfiguration of the cabin between Apr 20th and May 14th 2018, the cabin was configured for 189 passengers seats. The dispatcher computed and provided a load sheet, that the captain accepted, indicating the CG was at 22.2% MAC requiring 3.4 trim units nose up. Takeoff weight and CG were within permitted limits. However, the actual passenger distribution throughout the cabin did not match the dispatcher's documents, almost all the passengers took their seats in the aft cabin, which moved the CG to about 38% MAC outside of the permitted takeoff limitations. A Boeing simulation based on the FDR data estimated the CG near 40% MAC.The JIAAC stated the investigation is ongoing.On Oct 16th 2020 the Junta de Seguridad en el Transporte (JST, former JIAAC) released their final report in Spanish only (Editorial note: to serve the purpose of global prevention of the repeat of causes leading to an occurrence an additional timely release of all occurrence reports in the only world spanning aviation language English would be necessary, a Spanish only release does not achieve this purpose as set by ICAO annex 13 and just forces many aviators to waste much more time and effort each in trying to understand the circumstances leading to the occurrence. Aviators operating internationally are required to read/speak English besides their local language, investigators need to be able to read/write/speak English to communicate with their counterparts all around the globe).The investigation did not release a formal conclusion to the causes of the accident, but only listed numerous factors (findings) related to the accident as well as numerous findings not related to the accident but to operational safety. Within these findings the JST reported, that the Center of Gravity was between 38 and 40% MAC outside the permitted envelope, the actual distribution of passengers on board did not match the distribution used in the dispatch forms. As result the aircraft experienced a sudden pitch up causing the contact of the rear fuselage with the runway surface (tail strike).The investigation found that Flybondi had delegated dispatch in Iguazu Falls to Flyseg S.A. who did use a different computer system not in line with Flybondi's systems. No specific procedures were in place to transmit information between the systems. No visual monitoring of passenger distribution was done though required by Flybondi's Operations Manual. Flybondi did not monitor the dispatch activity by Flyseg S.A. It was not possible to determine why the actual distribution of passengers and distribution as used on the dispatch systems were in disagreement.A single inspection of the operation in Iguazo Falls by Authorities carried out of Jun 18th 2018, with no other inspections carried out, identified that the required familiarization flight by dispatchers had not been done. The volume of flights between Jun 18th and Jul 16th 20218 increased by 425% (from 32 to 136 flights). The accident flight was flight no. 70 of July 2018, the work hours of dispatch had increased to 60 hours a week, thereof 39 hours between July 13th 14:00L and July 16th 2018 02:00L. The service time thus did not comply with regulations.The investigation listed findings to the operational safety like the operator's weight and balance manual (WBM) did not meet the actual configuration of the aircraft. Boeing had not been notified of changes done to the aircraft, therefore the WBM was not updated. In addition, the WBM made reference to the Boeing 737-200 while the operator was using a Boeing 737-800. The envelope in chapter 7 of the WBM used to manually determine the CG of LV-HQY thus was wrong.The JST analysed that there were 65 passengers on board of the aircraft, 60 of them were seated aft of seat row 15. In additional 450kg of cargo was loaded in the aft cargo hold. The loadsheet had computed a takeoff mass of 55,633 kg and had computed the CG at 22.2% MAC, however, the JST found the actual CG was between 38 and 40% MAC. The limit of the CG was at 26% MAC however. There are no systems on the aircraft that could warn of a mismatch between actual and computed CG.When the engines were accelerated for takeoff the aircraft was accelerating through 5 knots over ground and the engines accelerating through 75% N1 the aircraft began to pitch up as result of the pitch up moments produced by the engine thrust until the aircraft's tail contacted the runway surface. Following the tail strike the crew rejected takeoff and returned to the apron.The seat assignments of passengers was done according to sales specifications. The seats in the aft cabin were generally cheaper than those in the forward cabin and were therefore the first to be sold.After completing the passenger registration the operator using their computer system informed dispatch about the assigned seats on the aircraft and the billed amount of luggage. This information was transmitted through a series of photos taken from the computer screen and transmitted by mobile phone, a procedure which was not established in the operations manual by Flybondi. The manual stated the dispatcher must be informed, however does not specify how this information is to be transferred. Based on the information received from the operator the dispatcher created the load sheet on his computer system, which computed the CG to be within the permitted envelope for takeoff though actually it was way outside the envelope.Due to the different computer systems in use the dispatcher had to manually transfer the data into his system which created the opportunity to introduce (unwanted) deviations as obviously occurred in this case. The evidence available to the investigation did not permit to identify the reasons of this deviation however.According to the operational manual of Flybondi the dispatcher can perform a visual check of the aircraft while he walks up to the cockpit to hand the loadsheet to the captain. However, at the accident flight the dispatcher did not conduct such a visual check to compare the actual passenger distribution in the cabin with his loadsheet.At the time of the accident the operations manual did not require to hand a copy of the loadsheet to the cabin crew and did not require that the cabin crew performed a cross check of the distribution of passengers.The operator did not have in place a safety management system (SMS), at the time of the accident it was not a requirement to implement a SMS. The airline was growing rapidly increasing its operations by about five times between February and July 2018. A plan to implement a SMS had been agreed on, a risk management of operational security was to be introduced during phase 3 of the plan. As result there was a substantial increase of operations at Iguazu Falls without assessing the impact on operational safety.There issues however begin with the monitoring by ANAC, the civil aviation authority. As part of the operator's certification ANAC defined a plan called MAC-TAC as "post certification surveillance", the investigation however did not receive any evidence indication this plan was put into effect.Metars:SARI 160500Z 05005KT CAVOK 21/17 Q1015=SARI 160400Z 05004KT CAVOK 21/16 Q1015=SARI 160300Z 05005KT CAVOK 23/18 Q1015=SARI 160200Z 05004KT CAVOK 23/17 Q1014=SARI 160100Z 05005KT CAVOK 23/17 Q1014=SARI 160000Z 05004KT CAVOK 23/17 Q1013=SARI 152300Z 36006KT CAVOK 23/17 Q1012=The passenger distribution (Graphics: JIAAC):The tail seen at the apron the following morning:
A Canarias Airlines Avions de Transport Regional ATR-72-212A, registration EC-MPI performing flight NT-112 from Tenerife Norte,CI to Las Palmas,CI (Spain) with 42 passengers and 4 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Tenerife's runway 12 when the right hand engine (PW127) failed prompting the crew to reject takeoff at high speed. The aircraft returned to the apron.Spain's CIAIAC reported the aircraft was close to rotation when the crew heard a strange noise, felt vibrations and saw abnormal right hand engine indciations and decided to reject takeoff. The engine failure caused damage to the fuselage, engine debris was found on the runway. There were no injuries, the damage to the aircraft is being determined, the occurrence was rated a serious incident so far.On Oct 9th 2020 the CIAIAC released their final report concluding the probable cause of the incident was:The investigation has determined that the engine distress that forced the crew to abort the takeoff was caused by the fatigue fracture of a blade in the second stage of the power turbine (PT2), followed by the overload fracture of several more blades.The CIAIAC analysed:In this case, the crew were able to abort the takeoff maneuver since the aircraft had not yet reached its rotation speed, which allowed the crew to brake and exit the runway without further incident. The crew reacted quickly and in accordance with the procedures and training they had received from the company.They also quickly reported the incident to ATC, which promptly gave them the information needed to vacate the runway without any risks.The question remains of why the information on the cockpit voice recorder was lost, since of the four tracks provided by the operator to the investigation team, none had valid information on it.There was no clear determination as to whether the data were lost because the crew did not follow the procedure when opening the relevant breaker, or whether the data were lost when downloaded and processed after the fact by the operators technical services.As for the cause of the engine distress, given all the previous cases presented, it seems that the problem is well known to both the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the Spanish National Aviation Safety Agency (AESA), as well as to the manufacturer.AESA is conducting a study of the fatigue failure of power turbine blades in the PW100 family of engines (specifically, the PW127 engine), and the flight safety offices are gathering information from national operators on the implementation of EASA Directive CF-2013-02 in their organizations, on the blades installed in the turbines of their engines, and on the frequency of hot-zone inspections and overhauls.For its part, the manufacturer has been improving the design and continues to work to design a PT2 blade with a different geometry and a new coating for the leading edge, which it plans to have ready in 2021.Having identified certain environments, such as those that are prone to corrosion, salinity or general contamination, where the likelihood of turbine blade wear is higher, it would be advisable for Pratt & Whitney Canada to not only offer the option to have a specific plan to ensure operators of their continuing airworthiness, but also to contact each of them and directly create a plan that is tailored to their needs.As for the specific event of concern in this report, it should be noted that Service Bulletin 21917, published in November 2017 and whose latest revision (#7) is from March 2019, specifies replacing the blades with PN 3124654-01 with blades with PN 3134564. This is because the protective layer on the leading edge of the blades proposed in the previous service bulletin, 21876, is not ideal to increasing the resistance of the blades to corrosion problems.This change affected engine ED-1404, which experienced a PT2 blade fracture d, but on the date of the event, said bulletin had not been implemented since the bulletin did not give a specific deadline, instead recommending that it be done when the engine is removed and accessible.The analysis of the fractured blades that were recovered concluded that the material had no existing faults and that only one of them had fatigue problems, with the remaining blades fracturing as a result of the failure of the first blade.The damaged PT2 (Photo: CIAIAC):
A Wizz Air UK Airbus A321-200, registration G-WUKG performing flight W9-2602 from London Luton,EN (UK) to Prague (Czech Republic) with 157 passengers and 7 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Luton's runway 26, when the first officer, pilot flying, initiated the rotation for takeoff at Vr, the aircraft however did not respond. The first officer pulled the stick to near fully aft, the aircraft still did not respond. The captain (32, ATPL, 8,305 hours total, 5,175 hours on type) applied TOGA thrust at which point the aircraft began to rotate, lifted off and climbed out to safety. The aircraft subsequently continued to the destination without further incident.The British AAIB released their bulletin reporting the A321 had been assigned to the flight at last moment in replacement of an A320. Seat assignmet for the passengers had been done based on the A320 layout, which left the rear seats of the aircraft empty and placed the CG of the aircraft forward outside the permitted forward limit of the operating envelope. The unusual distribution of passengers was not noticed by dispatcher or cabin crew. The captain of the flight remained unaware of the unusual distribution of passengers in the cabin, according to the loadsheet he was handed the weight distribution and CG was within limits. V1 was computed at 112 KIAS and Vr at 123 KIAS.The AAIB wrote:Due to the standard POSITIVE RATE OF CLIMB call being missed, the landing gear was not retracted until approximately 5,000 feet amsl. The flight was continued to Prague during which the crew analysed the problem and were informed by the Senior Cabin Attendant (SCA) that there were no passengers at the rear of the cabin. The actual passenger distribution did not match the load sheet distribution, which distributed passengers equally throughout the cabin. Close to the top of descent, the conclusion was made that the take-off stabiliser setting on the load sheet was incorrect and this had caused the delayed rotation. It was not realised at that time that the CG was out of limits. It was assumed that the CG was within limits and that the aircrafts auto-trim system had compensated for the different distribution once the aircraft had become airborne. A normal descent, approach and landing was carried out at the destination with no pitch control abnormalities experienced. Subsequently, it was discovered that the aircraft loading had placed it outside the permitted CG envelope.The AAIB analysed:The incident occurred due to the aircraft change from an A320 to an A321 not being notified to both OHD and PSD. As a result, the passengers were seated at the front of the aircraft, placing the CG outside the forward limit of the operating envelope. The effect of this was that, at rotation, the aircraft appeared to the crew not to respond as expected to the normal side stick control inputs due to the forward CG. The PF required almost maximum aft control input and the PM selected TOGA thrust before the aircraft nose lifted. The crew analysed the problem but considered that an incorrect stabiliser setting, taken from the load sheet, had caused the problem. Only at the top of the descent for the destination did it become apparent that the passengers had possibly been incorrectly distributed in the cabin. The crew did not experience any unusual control response during the approach and landing.Actual CG (Graphics: AAIB):CG according to loadsheet (Graphics: AAIB):
A CAA Compagnie Africaine Aviation Airbus A320-200, registration 9Q-CCA performing flight FPY-343 from Kisangani to Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of Congo) with 126 passengers and 6 crew, blew all 4 main gear tyres as result of a rejected takeoff from runway 13 of Kisangani.The French BEA reported in their weeky bulletin quoting Congolese Authorities, that the Airbus A320-200 registration 9Q-CAA was rolling/taxiing to the departure runway when all 4 main gear tyres burst at about 15:45L (14:45Z). The Accident Investigation Board of the Democratic Republic of Congo rated the occurrence a serious incident and opened an investigation.The crew of the aircraft reported they were accelerating for takeoff when an engine ingested a bird prompting the crew to reject takeoff at high speed and brake hard, which resulted in all 4 main gear tyres deflating.A passenger reported that the aircraft had taxied to the runway, turned onto the runway and was accelerating for takeoff, when suddenly the brakes came on hard, the nose made a pronounced down movement and the aircraft came to a stop disabled on the runway, emergency services responded. The passengers disembarked onto the runway and were taken to the terminal.Another aircraft took the passengers to Kinshasa in the evening.CAA currently operate three Airbus A320-200, according to ATDB the tailnumbers are 9Q-CCA, 9Q-CAT and 9Q-CCO with another Airbus A320-200 9Q-CSB in storage, these tailnumbers supported by photographic evidence while there is no trace of an Airbus A320 with the tailnumber 9Q-CAA (this tailnumber once belonged to a Boeing 727-200, see Accident: Compagnie Africaine Aviation B722 at Kinshasa on Jan 2nd 2010, veered off runway on landing).On Oct 6th 2020 the final report in French only, dated May 11th 2013 and released by the DR Congo's accident investigation Bureau Permanent d'Enquetes d'Accidents/Incidents d'Aviation (BPEA), surfaced on an otherwise currently defunct website by the BPEA (Editorial note: to serve the purpose of global prevention of the repeat of causes leading to an occurrence an additional timely release of all occurrence reports in the only world spanning aviation language English would be necessary, a French only release does not achieve this purpose as set by ICAO annex 13 and just forces many aviators to waste much more time and effort each in trying to understand the circumstances leading to the occurrence. Aviators operating internationally are required to read/speak English besides their local language, investigators need to be able to read/write/speak English to communicate with their counterparts all around the globe).The report concludes the probable cause of the incident was:the presence of an obstacle (bird) on the runway.The BPEA reported the aircraft had been cleared for takeoff from runway 13 and was accelerating for takeoff when the commander heard abnormal noise from the left hand engine (CFM56) consistent with a compressor stall and observed the engine's EGT rise to 890 degrees C. Before reaching V1 the commander rejected takeoff and decided to return to the apron. Once arriving at the apron all four main tyres deflated.The BPEA reported the airline did not await investigators to reach the incident scene, but returned the aircraft to Kinshasa. The aircraft resumed service three days after the occurrence without the investigators ever having opportunity to see the damaged aircraft.In addition, the BPEA complained DR Congo's CAA did not provide the documents about maintenance etc. as requested by the BPEA.The BPEA analysed that the captain heard unusual noises during the takeoff run, confirmed by engine indications the left hand engine had suffered a compressor stall and its EGT was fluctuating reaching up to 890 degrees C. At a speed of 155 KIAS he rejected takeoff and applied excessive braking which resulted in the brake blocks overheating and melting the fuse plugs of the main tyres.The airport authority does not have a safety management system or an emergency plan. In addition, it did not have sufficient equipment to keep birds away from the airport's movement areas. The airport air traffic controller was not licensed.DR Congo's Civil Aviation Authority did not provide adequate regulations nor did the CAA enforce or help operators to understand the regulations. There was no continuous oversight.The BPEA analysed the A320 was in good and airworthy condition at the time of the occurrence. The left hand engine ingested a bird during the takeoff run in dusk conditions prompting the captain to reject takeoff which in turn caused the fuse plugs of main tyres to melt and deflate the tyres. Weather was no factor in the occurrence.
A Jet2.com Boeing 737-800, registration G-JZHT performing flight LS-291 from Leeds,EN (UK) to Antalya (Turkey), was accelerating for takeoff from Leeds' runway 32 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed. The aircraft slowed safely, the crew reported a burning odour on the flight deck as cause of the rejected takeoff. After a first inspection by emergency services the aircraft taxied to the apron with emergency services in trail. A replacement Boeing 737-800 registration G-GDFV reached Antalya with a delay of 100 minutes.The occurrence aircraft returned to service about 26 hours after the rejected takeoff.
A Delta Airlines Airbus A319-100, registration N320NB performing flight DL-2913 from Salt Lake City,UT to Jackson,WY (USA), was departing runway 34L when just before becoming airborne the left hand engine (CFM56) failed. The crew continued takeoff, reduced the engine to idle thrust, levelled off at 9000 feet and returned to Salt Lake City for a safe landing on runway 34R about 20 minutes after departure.A replacement A319-100 registration N337NB reached Jackson with a delay of 2:20 hours.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Salt Lake City about 21 hours after landing.Passenger video (Video: Lift Blog):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEc511znHe8
A Flybe Embraer ERJ-195, registration G-FBEJ performing flight BE-4321 from Exeter,EN (UK) to Alicante,SP (Spain) with 100 passengers and 5 crew, had backtracked Exeter's runway 26 for departure, lined up for departure and was waiting for takeoff clearance when a loud bang occurred followed by haze developing in the cabin. The crew initiated an emergency evacuation of the aircraft via slides. A passenger sustained a serious injury (broken ankle) as result of the evacuation, a flight attendant minor injuries (ankle injury).The airline confirmed the aircraft was evacuated after haze developed in the cabin.On Sep 17th 2020 the AAIB released their final bulletin concluding the probable causes of the accident were:A lack of maintenance planning, training and control of resources led to an undesirable situation where a maintenance task was allocated to an engineer who was neither qualified nor competent to complete the task. A key step in the engine drying procedure was only described as recommended and the engineer did not complete all the elements of the task. This resulted in residual cleaning solution remaining within the ECS system, causing smoke and fumes within the cabin and cockpit and leading to an emergency evacuation. The engine drying procedure has since been amended to require this step to be carried out.Due to the order in which the emergency evacuation vital actions were performed, the flaps had insufficient time to travel to the selected position. This resulted in an increased drop to the ground for passengers evacuating via the overwing exits, with many reluctant to jump or slide off the wing. Additionally, despite the presence of a marked exit route on the wing with a non-slip surface, many passengers who exited via the overwing exits were uncertain where to go once out of the aircraft. Both of these factors increased the time taken for emergency evacuation to be completed.The AAIB summarized the sequence of events:Following completion of passenger boarding, the aircraft pushed back and taxied before being cleared to enter Runway 26, back-track and line up for takeoff. It was daylight, the visibility was in excess of 10 km and the wind was from 210° at 5 kt.The APU was shut down as the aircraft entered the runway and the air conditioning packs remained on with air supplied from the engines. A few seconds later, while back-tracking, both pilots became aware of fumes in the flight deck with a different odour, which the co‑pilot described as being like paint or white spirit. The wind was behind the aircraft at this point, so they initially thought the fumes were due to exhaust gas ingestion. Upon lining up at the runway threshold the flight crew had a brief discussion about whether the fumes were decreasing and decided that they were.Upon receiving takeoff clearance, the co-pilot advanced the thrust levers to 40% while holding the aircraft on the brakes and checked the engine indications, which were all normal. He then slowly advanced the thrust levers towards the takeoff setting, while still holding the aircraft on the brakes. As the engines reached approximately 55% power, he saw something out of the corner of his eye which he believed to have been a puff of smoke coming from an air conditioning vent. He immediately stated that he was not happy with the situation and retarded the thrust levers to idle. By then the smell of fumes had grown worse and smoke was visibly entering the flight deck.The commander set the park brake and asked the co-pilot to turn the engine bleeds and air conditioning packs to off and the flight deck windows were opened to ventilate the flight deck. There were no EICAS messages or warnings.The commander established contact with the senior cabin crew member (SCCM), who had simultaneously been trying to contact the flight deck. The SCCM reported that there was smoke and fumes in the cabin, but that the cabin crew could not identify the source.The commander decided to evacuate the aircraft. The co-pilot immediately selected flap 5, notified ATC of the intention to evacuate and requested assistance. Both pilots then carried out the Emergency Evacuation vital actions. After the commander had given the order to evacuate over the passenger address system, the flight crew followed the EMERGENCY EVACUATION checklist on the back of the QRH.The Airport Rescue Fire Fighting Services (ARFFS) arrived at the aircraft and were briefed on the nature of the emergency by the co-pilot through the flightdeck window. The ARFFS then assisted passengers on the ground as they exited the aircraft. In their abstract the AAIB annotated:Following an assessment of the situation, the commander initiated an emergency evacuation. During the evacuation, passengers who evacuated via the overwing exits reported being unsure of how to get down from the wing to the ground and several re-entered the cabin and exited via one of the escape slides.The smoke and fumes were subsequently attributed to an incorrectly performed engine compressor wash procedure, which was carried out by maintenance personnel the night before the occurrence flight.The AAIB further annotated with respect to the evacuation:Passengers evacuating via the overwing exits reported that once out on the wing, there was confusion as to how they should get off the wing down to the ground. Passengers still in the cabin reported that this led to a bottle-neck forming around the overwing exits. Two passengers who evacuated via the left overwing exit were able to jump down from the wing and assist other passengers to the ground. Despite this, several passengers commented that it was a very long drop to the ground and some landed awkwardly, sustaining minor injuries. Many of the passengers who exited via the overwing exits commented that the wing surface was very slippy and one fell over resulting in a minor injury. The overriding comment from those who had exited via the overwing exits was that it was not obvious to them that they were meant to climb off the wing via the trailing edge and some re-entered the cabin to find an alternative exit route. A 61 cm-wide walkway was demarcated at the wing root in black paint, with arrows pointing towards the trailing edge (Figure 1). None of the passengers mentioned noticing this, but several did mention a lack of instructions, support or guidance once they were out on the wing. Several passengers commented that they found the rear slides very steep and were surprised by the speed at which they slid down them. The slides at the rear do not round out at the bottom unlike the front slides, which means that individuals slid very fast onto the ground. This, and attempts by passengers to slow themselves on the slides, were the principal causes of the reported injuries. Two passengers assisted other passengers at the bottom of the rear slides. A number of passengers suffered minor cuts and grazes and one elderly passenger who had exited via D2R sustained a broken ankle. Two cabin crew members who exited via the rear slides, one carrying the megaphone and the other carrying the first aid kit, reported that this made it difficult to slow themselves down and one sustained an ankle injury.Cabin crew noticed that some passengers hesitated when instructed to jump and slide. They therefore advised the passengers to sit and slide rather than jump and slide.When the cabin crew believed that all passengers had left the aircraft, they checked the cabin and found several passengers stood on the wings unwilling to jump due to the height above the ground. These passengers were escorted back into the cabin and subsequently exited via the rear slides.The AAIB reported with respect to the flaps setting: "A review of the DFDR data confirmed that the flap selector lever was moved from the takeoff flap setting (flap 1) to flap 5. Although the flaps started moving in response to this selection, the engine 1 and 2 selectors were set to the off position approximately 2 seconds later when the flight crew shutdown the engines. This removed electrical power to the flaps and prevented them from travelling to the selected position. In the flap 1 position the flap angle had been 6.9° ; the flaps reached 7.2° before stopping."The AAIB analysed:GeneralOn the aircrafts first flight of the day fumes became apparent in the cockpit during the latter stages of the taxi out and were subsequently accompanied by smoke as the thrust levers were advanced for takeoff. The takeoff was discontinued after which the intensity of the smoke and fumes increased. Following the flight crews assessment of the situation, and confirmation from the SCCM of fumes and smoke in the cabin, the commander made the decision to evacuate.An engine compressor wash had been performed on the aircrafts No 1 engine during overnight maintenance on the night before the accident. A high-power engine ground run was not performed following the compressor wash, resulting in residual cleaning solution remaining in the compressor bleed air ducts. This can lead to fumes or unusual odours entering the cockpit and cabin.Source of the smoke and fumesDuring the engine dry-out procedure following the compressor wash, the engines were run only at idle power. At idle power the engine power setting would have been insufficient for the engine bleed source to switch to the HPC fifth stage bleed. To dry out the fifth stage bleed ducts, the procedure recommended running the engine up to 65% N1. By not performing a high-power engine ground run, residual cleaning solution remained within the fifth stage bleed ducts.As the thrust levers were advanced for takeoff the ECS bleed source would have switched to HPC fifth stage engine bleed, allowing smoke and fumes from the residual detergent to enter the cockpit and cabin.Compressor wash and dry-out procedureThe ESM task for Engine performance recovery is comprised of many subtasks covering several wash, rinse and drying scenarios. It contains multiple notes and cautions, not all of which stand out from the main text and some of which contain critical information. In particular, the information relating to the need to perform a high-power engine run during the dry-out procedure is included in a note rather than in a procedural step. The ESM indicated that this was a recommended rather than required action. The AAIB questioned the engine manufacturers rationale for this step being recommended rather than required.They advised that for consistency with the other strong cautions throughout the ESM task, conducting a high-power engine run should be a required step following a compressor wash with detergent. In June 2020, it updated ESM subtask 72-00-00-410-004 task to reflect this.Engineer 1 was more accustomed to working on another aircraft type. He had never performed a compressor wash on an E195 before, had limited experience in conducting engine runs on the E195 and was not qualified to conduct high-power engine runs. This, coupled with the fact that the procedure only recommended rather than required, a high‑power engine run, likely influenced his decision to proceed with and certify the task without alerting his supervisors of the need for a high-power ground run.The operators internal investigation identified that complex maintenance tasks, such as that for a compressor wash would benefit from a company process sheet to supplement manufacturers procedures. Organisational factors Maintenance planning, both at the operator and hangar level, did not adequately identify the resources required to undertake the compressor wash, nor attempt to match the requirements of the task to the capabilities of the oncoming hangar shifts. Systems in place did not assist maintenance planners and managers to easily establish the competence and approval status of individual engineers.As a result, this maintenance task was allocated to a shift which did not have the correct competence and approvals to carry out and certify the task, or to release the aircraft to service. Had Engineer 2 fully understood the requirements of the task, the resources required to complete it and the approval status of the engineers on the night shift, it is likely that the task would have been rejected by the night shift instead of being allocated to Engineer 1. Similarly, had Engineer 4 understood these aspects, it is likely the task would have been deferred when it could not be completed by the day shift. The operators internal investigation found that willingness to get the job done, may have led to opportunities to stop the task being missed and existing policies may have placed too much reliance on individual engineers to identify tasks that could not be safely accomplished. With regard to conducting engine ground runs, the operators internal investigation identified a lack of suitably trained engineers, trainers and training opportunities. It also identified a lack of specific training or assisting documentation for conducting engine compressor washes and using compressor wash rigs.Many of the compressor wash rigs were found to be in poor condition. There were no records of when they were last replenished, the type or concentration of detergent used or on which aircraft they had been used. The lack of records meant that it was not possible to determine the concentration of cleaning solution that had been in the rig, prior to its replenishment by Engineer 3.Although night shift engineers permanently worked nights, no fatigue risk assessment had been carried out to understand the potential impact on individual performance. Both Engineer 1 and 2 disclosed that they had been experiencing personal issues, which could have been affecting their mental state. Although aware, it was not determined whether their managers had taken any steps to determine whether they were capable of being on duty and certifying aircraft, and the operators internal investigation identified that only minimal training was available for supervisors and managers in this regard.The operator had taken several safety actions to address these and other issues. However, it ceased operations before all intended safety actions could be fully implemented.EvacuationThe commanders decision to evacuate was based on his concern that there may have been a fire on the aircraft and was likely influenced by the increase in intensity of the fumes, the appearance of smoke in the cockpit and confirmation of smoke and fumes of unknown origin in the cabin.The flight crew actioned the emergency evacuation vital actions (memory items) followed by the QRH EMERGENCY EVACUATION checklist. Both the memory actions and the QRH checklist require the flight crew to set the emergency/parking brake to on, select flap 5 and then move the thrust levers to idle. In this case, as the aircraft was stationary the thrust levers had already been retarded to flight idle and the parking brake set. The vital actions were therefore performed somewhat out of sequence and proceeded more rapidly than might be expected if an emergency evacuation followed a rejected takeoff or emergency landing scenario. Therefore, despite selection of flap 5, the flaps had insufficient time to travel to the selected position before the engines were shutdown. This resulted in an increased drop to the ground for passengers evacuating via the overwing exits, with many reluctant to jump or slide off the wing, leading to an increase in the time taken to complete the evacuation.The emergency evacuation vital actions use the term confirm flap 5, which suggests that this action requires the flight crew to confirm that the flaps have already travelled to flap 5. The commander commented that in training, an emergency evacuation is most often practiced following a rejected takeoff scenario and flap 5 is selected as soon as the decision to reject is made and before the aircraft has been brought to a stop. The flaps would therefore have travelled to the selected position by the time the emergency evacuation vital actions were actioned.Passenger Video (Video: Andy Feaver):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_WPIlcrtP8
A Skywest Canadair CRJ-700 on behalf of American Airlines, registration N603SK performing flight AA-3004 from Chicago O'Hare,IL to Detroit,MI (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Chicago's runway 28R when the crew rejected takeoff at about 60 knots over ground and vacated the runway. The crew reported they had blown a tyre and maintenance was responding.A replacement CRJ-700 registration N740SK reached Detroit with a delay of about 70 minutes.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Chicago about 34 hours after the rejected takeoff.
A Southwest Airlines Boeing 737-700, registration N420WN performing flight Milwaukee,WI to Orlando,FL (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Milwaukee's runway 19R when the crew rejected takeoff due to two large birds hitting the left hand engine (CFM56) about 1100 meters/3600 feet down the runway. The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway via taxiway S (1900 meters/6300 feet down the runway) and stopped on taxiway T, emergency services responded. After an inspection the aircraft taxied to the apron with emergency services in trail.The airport advised another departure to exercise caution, they had had a couple of bird strikes that morning.The flight was cancelled.The aircraft is still on the ground in Milwaukee about 26 hours after the rejected takeoff.
A Solomon Airlines de Havilland DHC-6-300 Twin Otter, registration H4-OTA performing a flight from Atoifi to Manaoba (Solomon Islands), was accelerating for takeoff from Atoifi's grass runway (about 800 meters/2750 feet long, approx. direction 14/32, position S8.8725 E161.0113) when the crew rejected takeoff stopping the aircraft safely on the runway.A passenger reported the aircraft was accelerating when there was a big bang, the aircraft lowered its nose and slowed, the engines were no longer operating. The aircraft was disabled, locals pushed the aircraft off the muddy runway back to the apron.Another local reported the aircraft was fixed the same day.The aircraft being pushed back off the runway (Photos: Yumi TokTok Forum):Map (Graphics: Google Earth):
A Royal Air Maroc Boeing 737-800, registration CN-RGJ performing flight AT-807 from London Gatwick,EN (UK) to Casablanca (Morocco) with 139 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Gatwick's runway 26L when the (automated) V1 and rotate calls did not occur. The aircraft rotated at a speed 37 knots above Vr and 120 meters/400 feet short of the runway end. The aircraft climbed out to safety and continued to Casablanca for a safe landing.On Sep 10th 2020 the AAIB released their final bulletin concluding the probable cause of the serious incident was:During the takeoff roll, the V1 automatic call did not occur and the takeoff speeds were not displayed on the PFD. This led to a late rotation.The incident shows that automatic calls may not always work as the flight crew expect and they should be ready to respond appropriately. The AAIB summarized the sequence of events:The co-pilot was the pilot flying for the return sector. Runway 26L was in use, with a light southerly wind and rain. The cloud was broken at 900 ft and the temperature was 6°C. The flight crew planned to depart from intersection A, using flap 1 and an assumed temperature of 55°C. They had calculated takeoff speeds of V1 - 144 kt, VR - 152 kt, and V2 - 155 kt. The commander reported that these takeoff performance figures were loaded into the FMC on stand and no changes were required during the taxi to the runway.The aircraft entered the runway at intersection A and was cleared for takeoff. At 80 kt the commander confirmed that the airspeed indications were normal and the flight crew were next expecting to hear the aircraft announce V1 but, this automatic call did not occur.When the commander realised the automatic call had not occurred, he checked his PFD and saw the V speed bugs were not displayed on the speed tape. He felt the aircraft was slow so he allowed it to accelerate whilst he evaluated the situation. He did not recall if the speeds were still displayed on his Control Display Unit (CDU). As the end of the runway approached, he instructed the co-pilot to initiate a smooth rotation. The aircraft took off and the remainder of the flight proceeded without further incident. No aircraft caution or warning messages were seen at any stage.The commander reported the lack of the automatic call in the aircrafts technical log after the flight. Subsequent investigation by the operator did not find any aircraft faults. The automatic calls worked normally on the preceding and subsequent flights.The AAIB reported the QAR data: This showed that the nosewheel lifted off at 189 kt. The aircraft was airborne approximately 120 m prior to the end of the runway at 196 kt and 13 seconds after the planned rotation speed. Figure 1 shows the takeoff roll and highlights key speeds and heights. The data also showed the thrust was slightly increased just prior to the rotation.The QAR records the assumed temperature and V speeds entered in the FMC, and the Mode Control Panel (MCP) selected speed (which is normally set to V2 on the ground). However, for the incident flight, the V speeds were blank. The QAR started recording after engine start and the V speeds were blank throughout the taxi and takeoff. The QAR did record an assumed temperature of 55°C1 and an MCP Selected Speed of 155 kt. The QAR files were checked, by the operator, for the previous and subsequent flights, and V speeds were recorded normally on these flights.Takeoff Roll, speeds and heights (Graphics: AAIB):
A PIA Pakistan International Airlines Airbus A320-200, registration AP-BLZ performing flight PK-325 from Islamabad to Quetta (Pakistan) with about 100 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Islamabad's runway 28L when the crew rejected takeoff at about 72 knots over ground. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The aircraft attempted a second takeoff from runway 28L about 16:42L (11:42Z) but rejected another time at about 94 knots over ground.The flight was postponed to the next day, a replacement A320-200 registration AP-BLU reached Quetta with a delay of 24 hours.The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground in Islamabad for about two hours after the second rejected takeoff, then departed for flight PK-319 to Karachi (Pakistan). The aircraft is still on the ground in Karachi about 19 hours after landing in Karachi.The airline reported flight PK-325 was cancelled due to malfunctioning/misreading sensors in the aircraft computer systems. The passengers were taken to hotels over night, a rescheduled flight departed the following day.
A North Star Air Douglas DC-3 in the colours of Cargo North, registration C-FKGL performing flight BF-102 from Pickle Lake,ON to Big Trout Lake,ON (Canada) with 3 people on board, departed Pickle Lake but immediately after takeoff the crew needed to put the aircraft down again onto the ice of Pickle Lake. There were no injuries, the aircraft sustained substantial damage.Nav Canada reported the aircraft was taxiing for departure at 17:05Z, immediately after departure the aircraft crash landed on the ice of Pickle Lake at about 17:30Z.Transport Canada's CADORS database released a correction late Mar 21st 2017 stating the aircraft owner and operator was North Star Air, not Private Air as initially reported. Canada's Aircraft Registry Database still reflects Private Air as owner of the aircraft however.On Mar 28th 2017 the aircraft departed the ice of Pickle Lake. On Apr 11th 2017 Canada's TSB reported that the aircraft rotated at 83 KIAS, the crew however did not observe any climb performance, the aircraft did not accelerate and did not achieve a positive rate of climb. The crew therefore performed a forced landing, the aircraft came to a stop on the frozen surface of Pickle Lake about 1300 meters from the departure end of runway 27. The aircraft received damage to engine (PT6A), propellers and cowlings. The drag brace attachment points of both landing gear struts were broken away, the lower longerons and associated structures in the engine nacelles were damaged due to impact with the landing gear axles. The TSB inspected the aircraft, found the tanks were properly filled, the aircraft weight and balance was within permitted limits. Examinations of the engines revealed there was no pre-impact conditions that would have contributed to the occurrence. The propeller governors were tested and found working properly. The TSB was able to determine the propellers were rotating at takeoff setting of 1700 rpm. The engines were replaced on the lake and repairs were made that permitted a ferry flight from Pickle Lake to Thunder Bay,ON for further repairs.On Aug 31st 2020 The Aviation Herald erroneously attached the final report of the occurrence of Jun 21st 2019, see Report: North Star DC3T at Fort Hope on Jun 21st 2019, both engines lost power after departure and removed that final report from this coverage again.Metars:CYPL 171900Z 12007KT 3/4SM -SN VV005 M01/M02 A2976 RMK SN8 SLP102=CYPL 171848Z 13006KT 3/4SM -SN VV005 M01/M02 A2977 RMK SN8 SLP103=CYPL 171837Z 14005KT 1SM -SN OVC005 M01/M02 A2977 RMK SN3SF5 SLP103=CYPL 171800Z 15006KT 5/8SM -SN VV005 M01/M03 A2977 RMK SN8 /S05/ SLP105=CYPL 171734Z 14007KT 3/4SM -SN VV005 M01/M03 A2978 RMK SN8 SLP106=CYPL 171700Z 15005KT 3/4SM -SN VV006 M02/M03 A2978 RMK SN8 SLP107=CYPL 171600Z 15008KT 1SM -SN SCT007 OVC020 M03/M04 A2978 RMK SN3SF1SC4 SLP108=CYPL 171500Z 16009KT 1 1/2SM -SN OVC025 M03/M05 A2978 RMK SN2SC6 SLP109=CYPL 171415Z 16009KT 1 1/2SM -SN OVC025 M03/M05 A2978 RMK SN2SC6 SLP110=CYPL 171400Z 16008KT 3SM -SN OVC025 M03/M06 A2979 RMK SC8 SLP111=C-FKGL on the ice of Pickle Lake (Photo: Paul Colyn):Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):
An Airblue Airbus A321-200, registration AP-BMM performing flight PA-205 from Islamabad to Karachi (Pakistan), was accelerating for takeoff from Islamabad's runway 10R when the crew rejected takeoff at about 80 knots due to disagreeing airspeeds. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.A replacement A321-200 registration AP-BMP reached Karachi with a delay of about 2 hours.The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground for about 4 hours, then returned to service.
A Delta Airlines Airbus A321-200, registration N331DN performing flight DL-1315 from Detroit,MI to Salt Lake City,UT (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Detroit's runway 22L when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed advising they had received a message and needed no assistance. The aircraft taxied clear of the runway and stopped on an adjacent taxiway for about 30 minutes. The crew subsequently reported they needed to return to the gate, they had received a message for something regarding the pressurization, that required them to stop.A replacement A321-200 registration N383DZ is estimated to reach Salt Lake City with a delay of about 2:45 hours.
A Piedmont Airlines Embraer ERJ-145 on behalf of American Airlines, registration N634AE performing flight AA-4873 from Roanoke,VA to Philadelphia,PA (USA) with 36 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from runway 24, when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed reporting smoke in the cockpit. The aircraft stopped on the runway and was evacuated.The runway was closed for about 80 minutes until the aircraft was moved off the runway.A replacement ERJ-145 registration N654AE reached Philadelphia with a delay of 2.5 hours.
An AirAsia India Airbus A320-200, registration VT-HKG performing flight I6-632 from Ranchi to Mumbai (India), was accelerating for takeoff from Ranchi's runway 31 when the crew rejected takeoff after an engine had ingested a bird and failed with a bang and sparks. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.A replacement A320-200 registration VT-JRT reached Mumbai with a delay of about 9 hours.
An Easyjet Airbus A320-200, registration G-EZWE performing flight U2-1820 from Lisbon (Portugal) to Manchester,EN (UK) with 167 passengers and 6 crew, was preparing for departure from Lisbon when the crew computed their takeoff performance from runway 21 believing, they were computing the performance from intersection S1 (the shortest available takeoff distance), when in fact they were using the full runway length. The aircraft subsequently taxied to runway 21 intersection U5 (longer takeoff distance than from S1), lined up and departed becoming airborne only 110 meters (360 feet) ahead of the runway end and achieved 35 feet height before crossing the runway end. The aircraft continued to Manchester for a safe landing about 2.5 hours later.The British AAIB reported Portugal's GPIAA delegated the investigation to the AAIB and released their final report concluding the probable cause of the serious incident were:The aircraft took off using incorrect performance data for the intersection used. A selection error was made in the EFB calculation which led the crew to believe that they had calculated performance information for a departure from S1 when in fact they had selected the full length of the runway. In this case, as in the two previous identical incidents, the final barrier of checking the runway distance in the performance calculation against the aerodrome ground chart failed to prevent to error. Human performance limitations mean it is difficult for pilots to recognise and react to the performance error once the takeoff has begun, so robust adherence to procedures is a key defence against such incidents occurring.The AAIB reported the takeoff distance available from U5 was 1395 meters less than the takeoff distance available full length of the runway. As result V1 for departure from U5 would have been 142 knots, not 162 knots as computed.The AAIB analysed:During pre-flight preparation, both flight crew of G-EZWE selected PSNSTMP in the EFB believing it to be where Taxiway S1 crossed Runway 21, but the position was actually for the full length of the runway. The operators SOPs required the crew to cross-check the distance shown in the EFB against that shown in the aerodrome ground chart for the takeoff position, but this cross-check did not capture the error. As a result, a lower power setting was used for takeoff than was required for the actual takeoff from Taxiway U5 intersection (Taxiway S1 intersection was more limiting). G-EZWE lifted off 110 m or, at the speed at which the aircraft was travelling, approximately 1.3 seconds before reaching the end of the runway. This was the third aircraft from the same operator, although one was operating under a different AOC, which had experienced similar incidents in the previous six months.In all three cases the pilots were confused by the EFB intersection selections as they did not use the actual taxiway names. Also, there were two points on the runway which intersect Taxiway S (1 and 4) both of which might have been thought by the crew to be in the EFB as PSNSTMP as the taxiway numbers are not used in the nomenclature.During the completion of the initial calculation the crew were interrupted numerous times despite the SOP mitigations that the operator had in place. The commander also had no access to the EFB once the aircraft taxied due to an inoperative cradle. He was not, therefore, in a position to see the taxi plate or the performance calculation, although he was not required to be by the company SOPs. The EFB battery condition had substantially deteriorated over time and the EFB was not useable for long without being charged by the cradle. The UK CAA decided to revise the EFB compliance checklist, SRG form 1849, to ensure that the requirement for a periodic battery replacement programme is emphasised.The crew did not recognise the takeoff performance was incorrect until a late stage of the takeoff run. This would match with previous investigations completed by the AAIB which have shown that humans are not physiologically adapted to identify different acceleration rates, and often do not realise something is wrong until the end of the runway comes into view. As in previous incidents, TOGA thrust was not selected despite the compromised takeoff performance.The magnitude of the error meant that had the aircraft stopped from a speed close to or at V1 , a significant overrun could have occurred. This could have caused significant damage to the aircraft and its occupants.The AAIB reported following safety actions were taken:Following the previous incidents, the AAIB reported that the Lisbon Airport operator intended to rename taxiways to remove the risk of confusion between the two points where Taxiway S crossed Runway 21. The taxiways would be renamed so that Taxiway S intersected the runway at only one point; S4 (full length). This safety action was completed, albeit after the incident to G-EZWE, and is reported here.The operator has moved onto Flysmart L6 performance software which now shows the crew a pictorial image of the takeoff point used for the calculation.The takeoff point selection menu was also amended to eliminated Position S making it clear to the crews that this was full length for Runway 21.The UK CAA decided to revise the EFB compliance checklist, SRG form 1849, to ensure that the need for a periodic battery replacement programme is emphasised.The AAIB released safety recommendation:- Safety Recommendation 2020-003:It is recommended that ANA Aeroportos de Portugal discontinue the use of takeoff Positions at Lisbon Airport to minimise confusion concerning takeoff points.Aerodrome chart (Graphics: AAIB):
A Laudamotion Airbus A320-200, registration OE-LOA performing flight OE-327 from London Stansted,EN (UK) to Vienna (Austria) with 169 passengers and 7 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Stansted's runway 22 when the crew rejected takeoff very early into the takeoff run after a loud bang was heard. The aircraft stopped about 270 meters/890 feet down the runway. An emergency evacuation via slides was performed. Ten passengers received minor injuries as result of the evacuation.A passenger reported there was a huge bang due to an engine (CFM56) failure, the aircraft skidded to a stop, and they evacuated via the slides. The airline reported the crew rejected takeoff due to a problem with one of the engines.A ground observer reported a streak of flames came out of the left hand engine followed by white sparks just when the aircraft had moved a few meters. On Mar 4th 2019 another passenger (nickname Mike), who had already posted a comment here on Mar 2nd 2019 15:04z, followed up reporting he was able to see the left hand wing and the exhaust of the left hand engine from his seat, a bang and a brief streak of flames (estimated length of flame 2-3 meters) associated with a puff of smoke was released from the engine. The event looked like similiar to an engine failure by an A330 in Manchester filmed by Simon Lowe (see video referenced below). The aircraft came to a stop, the cabin was quiet, no sounds, no alerts, no beeps. Both engines had been shut down, the APU was running. No smoke or unusual odour occurred. No smoke or other anomaly was seen from the engine. In a distance emergency vehicles could be seen responding, a lot of flashing blue lights surfaced, the fire engines arrived and looked at what appeared to be a leak from the left hand engine. The flight attendants were communicating with each other shouting from the front of the cabin to the back of the cabin and back. One of them shouted "it doesn't work", then they began to shout "evacuate". An evacuation through all doors, including all left hand doors, was performed. The passenger annotated he didn't notice any of the flight attendants to check the left hand engine through any of the windows. After sliding down the passenger still did not see any trace of fire or smoke. The passenger summarized the event is pretty well described by the A330 video, much better than he could have put it into words.The AAIB announced they have dispatched a go team to Stansted to investigate the occurrence.On Mar 8th 2019 the AAIB reported the aircraft sustained substantial damage when the #1 engine failed, the takeoff was rejected at low speed followed by a "full evacuation". The highest level of injury is still unknown. The occurrence was rated an accident and is being investigated by the AAIB.On Aug 6th 2020 the AAIB released their final report concluding the probable causes of the accident were:The left engine experienced a contained engine failure. All the damage found in the engine was consistent with the release of one or more high-pressure compressor stage 1 blades as a result of high-cycle fatigue arising from aerodynamic excitation of the blades. A single inlet guide vane lever arm, which had been improperly assembled in the connecting link on the inlet guide vane actuation ring, was identified as the source of the stimulus that resulted in the blade release.As a result of the engine failure and subsequent rejected takeoff, the Senior Flight Attendant commanded an emergency evacuation that was not necessary in the circumstances. This was probably the result of a combination of factors that heightened her emotional response to the event and affected her decision making. The factors included inexperience as a flight attendant, weaknesses in her training and communication difficulties during the event.As a result of the flight crew not being consulted before the evacuation was commenced, the right engine remained running for the first few minutes of the evacuation. This led to an increased risk of serious injury to those passengers that evacuated on the right side of the aircraft. Indeed, several passengers sustained minor injuries having been blown over by the exhaust.During the evacuation several passengers hindered the evacuation by taking their cabin baggage with them. While some were removed by the flight attendants at the supervised exits, this was not possible at the overwing exits. Two Safety Recommendations are made regarding passengers evacuating with carry-on baggage.The AAIB analysed:After the failure of the left engine the flight crew responded correctly by rejecting the takeoff, bringing the aircraft to a stop and announcing attention crew: on station to the FAs and actioning the ECAM checklist. As the engine failure was secured by the crew actioning the ECAM checklist and there were no other causes for concern, the decision to vacate the runway under the power of the right engine was appropriate.The crew were subsequently surprised to see a cabin door open, a slide deployed and passengers walking in front of the aircraft. The commander then contacted the SFA to ask why an evacuation had been initiated. After this exchange he realised that passengers were going towards the right engine, which was still operating. Had any of them entered the right engines inlet suction danger area (Figure 1, Area A), it is possible that they could have been sucked into the engine. The right engine was shutdown 2 minutes after the commander noticed that Door 1L was open.Once they had noticed that an evacuation had commenced there was realistically no way that the flight crew would have been able to recover the situation. It may have been prudent to action the EMER EVAC checklist to ensure that the aircraft systems were all in as safe a state as possible for the passengers to exit the aircraft. However, given that passengers were potentially going to encroach into the right engines inlet suction danger area it was probably quicker to select the eng master to off. Had the commander prioritised shutting down the engine and thus had a more succinct discussion with the SFA, the right engine could have been shut down sooner.Flight attendant aspects All evacuations carry risk of passenger injury so flight attendants should not command an evacuation unless there is no doubt that it is required. The operators Flight Safety Manual listed the circumstances when flight attendants should initiate an evacuation and none of these criteria applied. A combination of factors combined to overwhelm the SFA and cause her to command the evacuation over the PA.At the front of the aircraft, the noise of the engine failure sounded very loud to the two FAs. The SFA was startled by the noise of the engine failure and the movement of the aircraft to the side of the runway. This appears to have caused her to narrow her attention to the aircraft sounds so that she did not hear the attention crew: on station command. The other FAs all heard it and were not aware that she had not.Initially it was organised and calm in the cabin at the rear of the aircraft. The crew members there were helped by the calming influence of FA4 who was more experienced. Also FA3 and the ACM were recent recruits and may have benefitted from the recency of their training.Communication between the SFA and FA3 was not effective in either means or content. The crew members and passengers accounts suggested that communication was attempted using a combination of the PA system, the interphone, shouting and hand gestures. A combination of English and German language was used.The interphone at the FA3 seat was knocked off by the force of the folding seat closing. This resulted in the attention-getting chime and lights being inhibited so there was a delay between the SFA calling and establishing communication. The FAs reported that the handsets were prone to falling out of the cradle.It was dark outside, and the cabin lights were dimmed for takeoff. The lack of light in the cabin made it difficult to see what was happening at the rear of the aircraft so communication by hand signals was not effective and the SFA could not see that the interphone was stuck.The communication difficulty meant that the SFA could not establish whether the situation was safe at the rear of the aircraft. The SFA formed the impression that all the other flight attendants were scared. Only one minute and twenty seconds elapsed between the attention crew: on station command and the evacuate command by the SFA. It would have felt like much longer to the flight attendants, especially the SFA who had heard nothing from the cockpit and felt under pressure from the passengers. Altogether this increased her anxiety and uncertainty and contributed to her commanding the evacuation.Any FA could have contacted the cockpit during this time. The FAs who heard the attention crew: on station command would have been unlikely to do so because they understood the procedure to wait. The SFA had not heard this command but it did not occur to her to contact the pilots. As well as her emotional state, this may have been partly because her interactions with them were so limited under normal circumstances. The operator did not provide training for FAs and pilots designed to increase their interaction and understanding of each others roles. All FAs had been trained that the pilots would be busy in an emergency, but they had no understanding of the tasks the pilots were doing or how long they would take.Not all passengers heard the evacuation command on the PA. If the evacuation signal had been used the passenger response and the overall evacuation may have been quicker. However, this was not available to the FAs and the pilots were unlikely to operate it given they had not commanded the evacuation.The SFA had recently been promoted after a relatively short time as an FA. During her time as FA, there was a period where she did not fly due to the operators bankruptcy. As a result, she did not meet the operators requirement for promotion in terms of duration of operational experience. Her initial training course as an FA was within a large group which may have resulted in aspects not being fully explained or understood by all that attended.The pressure to have staff operationally available for flights after the bankruptcy and change of operator meant that the subsequent training for SFA was purely theoretical and short in comparison to the operators more recent practice. These factors may have meant that the SFA was not well prepared for her role in the emergency.All FA practical training for emergencies involved a practice evacuation. None of them had practiced a return to normal operation. This may have resulted in a false expectation that all emergencies would result in an evacuation.Overall, it seems that the SFAs emotional response to the emergency was aggravated by her general inexperience and the communication difficulties the FAs encountered. Despite meeting regulatory requirements, there were weaknesses in her training that meant she was not well prepared for the situation. Together this resulted in an overwhelming flight response in which she felt the need for herself and everyone else in the cabin to escape the situation as quickly as possible. She did not contact the pilots and ended up commanding an evacuation. The operator has undertaken to implement a range of improvements to FA training and to instruct FAs to attempt to establish communication with the flight deck before commanding an evacuation.The evacuation Once the evacuation was commenced it was important that it proceeded in as safe and efficient a manner as possible to minimise the risk of passenger injury. In general, the evacuation proceeded swiftly, without significant panic or delay. The event provided an opportunity to learn about factors that influence a safe and efficient evacuation.Many passengers in this evacuation collected their bags and attempted to leave the aircraft with them. At the supervised doors, the FAs removed baggage from them. At the unsupervised overwing exits passengers with bags could exit unchallenged. Baggage brought to the exits created difficulty for the FAs who then needed to remove it and store it somewhere which could have created an obstruction. The carried baggage probably slowed the evacuation and had the potential to damage the escape slides or injure other passengers on the slides. It was not possible to determine how long the evacuation took compared to the CS-25 requirement of 90 seconds.The safety studies by the NTSB, TSB Canada, EASA and the Royal Aeronautical Society show that carried baggage has long been an issue. Appendix 1 lists many of the evacuation events identified in these four studies and provides additional details. It shows that it is extremely common for passengers to carry off bags in evacuations, even when there is a clear and immediate threat to life from remaining on board the aircraft. One of the events shows that even trained flight crew are not immune from the compulsion to keep their possessions with them. There were several examples where witnesses reported that this passenger behaviour slowed the evacuation or that the evacuation took longer than 90 seconds.The Royal Aeronautical Society commented that:This trend appears to be increasing and can only be exacerbated by the increasing volume of cabin baggage being permitted by some operators for commercial reasons. The Society made a recommendation to consider physical means of preventing passengers retrieving their baggage:Aviation authorities should consider the feasibility of introducing a certification requirement for a means of remotely locking, from the flight deck, overhead bins in passenger cabins that do not contain emergency equipment, for taxi, take-off and landing. Current mitigations for the issue include passenger briefing and printed instructions on the cabin safety card. However, the motivation for passengers to remain united with their baggage is extremely powerful and, in some cases, the danger is not immediately apparent to passengers. These factors may lead passengers to feel it is safe to pause and collect baggage and for the evacuation to proceed at a slower pace. For a high proportion of passengers, briefing and instruction by FAs does not overcome this.The AAIB released two safety recommendations, both dealing with passenger behaviour in evacuations:- Safety Recommendation 2020-018It is recommended that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency commission research to determine how to prevent passengers from obstructing aircraft evacuations by retrieving carry-on baggage.- Safety Recommendation 2020-019It is recommended that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency consider including a more realistic simulation of passenger behaviour in regard to carry-on baggage in the test criteria and procedures for the emergency demonstration in CS-25.The video of an A330 engine failure in Manchester referenced by passenger Mike (Video: Simon Lowe):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS1YAX70edcThe right engine (Photo: Mike):The left engine:The aircraft after the evacuation:
A Trigana Air Service Boeing 737-300, registration PK-YSG performing freight flight IL-7341 from Jayapura to Wamena (Indonesia) with 4 crew and 16 tons of goods, was accelerating for takeoff from runway 30 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed due to severe vibrations, the aircraft suddenly turned around about abeam taxiway D (about half way down the runway, 1585 meters from threshold runway 30, 1400 meters from end of runway 30). The aircraft had suffered damage to a nose wheel, the left main wheels rotated almost 90 degrees, the right main gear went off the paved surface. The aircraft was disabled on the runway. There were no injuries.The crew reported they were taxiing to line up for departure.Ground observers reported the occurrence happened shortly before takeoff, while it appeared to line up for departure it went off the runway.The airport reported the aircraft was taxiing for departure when it went off runway 30. The airport was closed for about 5 hours until the aircraft could be moved off the runway.Indonesia's KNKT opened an investigation.On Aug 3rd 2020 Indonesia's KNKT released their preliminary report describing the sequence of events:At 0722 LT, the Sentani Tower controller (Sentani controller) issued the push back and start clearances. Afterward the pilot conducted the aircraft push back while the engine start was conducted during the push back. After engine start completed, the pilots conducted the before taxi procedures and the PM requested taxi clearance to Sentani controller.At 0725 LT, the taxi clearance was issued and the Sentani controller instructed the flight crew to taxi to runway 30 via taxiway NP and E. Subsequently the aircraft taxied normally and at 0726 LT the aircraft held on taxiway E waiting for another aircraft for takeoff.At 0745 LT, the Sentani controller issued clearance to enter the runway 30 and the aircraft taxied backtrack to the beginning of runway 30.At 0748 LT, the Sentani controller issued takeoff clearance and the departure clearance to continue on heading 270a and initial altitude of 8,000 feet.About 30 seconds after the takeoff clearance issued by the Sentani controller, the takeoff roll was initiated. About 2 seconds after the PM called the aircraft speed of 80 knots, the pilots felt aircraft vibration and became severe as the aircraft speed increased. The observation to the runway found that about 500 meters from the beginning runway 30, there were oscillated wheel marks of the main landing gear left and right on the runway.When aircraft speed about 110 knots, the PF decided to reject the takeoff. The PF felt that the aircraft direction could not be controlled and the braking was ineffective. As seen on the Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) record, it shown that several seconds after rejected takeoff executed, the aircraft skidded longitudinally with the nose headed to the right. Thereafter, the aircraft veered to the right and continued until excursed from the runway. The aircraft still moving on the right of the runway shoulder with the nose headed on the runway heading. After crossed the taxiway D, the aircraft speed decreased while the aircraft was turning about 360 degrees. The aircraft stop on the right runway shoulder about 1,600 meters from the beginning of runway 30 on heading 270 degrees.The KNKT reported the aircraft sustained substantial damage including damage to the left hand engine's fan blades, right hand engine's inlet cone, nose wheels fractured at the wheel hubs, all torsion links of the main landing gear fractured with the left hand main wheels pointing 90 degrees to the direction of movement of the aircraft, the left shimmy damper piston assembly had separated and was found on the runway about 1300 meters from the runway 30 threshold. The KNKT reported the airline took an immediate safety action:On 26 February 2020, Trigana issued the Engineering Instruction (EI) identified by number B737-EI/32/083R1 with the title DVI Main Landing Gear Shimmy Damper Bolt.The Engineering Instruction contained instruction to inspect all B737 operated by Trigana in regard to the shimmy damper bolt.Related NOTAMs:B0587/20 NOTAMNQ) WAAF/QMRLC/IV/NBO/A/000/999/0234S14031E005A) WAJJ B) 2002242310 C) 2002250300 ESTE) RWY 12/30 CLSD DUE TO BLOCKED BY ACFTB0587/20 NOTAMNQ) WAAF/QMRLC/IV/NBO/A/000/999/0234S14031E005A) WAJJ B) 2002242310 C) 2002250300 ESTE) RWY 12/30 CLSD DUE TO BLOCKED BY ACFTB0588/20 NOTAMR B0587/20Q) WAAF/QMRLC/IV/NBO/A/000/999/0234S14031E005A) WAJJ B) 2002250153 C) 2002250600 ESTE) RWY 12/30 CLSD DUE TO BLOCKED BY ACFTB0124/20 NOTAMNQ) WAAF/QMXLC/IV/M/A/000/999/0234S14031E005A) WAJJ B) 2001132000 C) 2004131100E) TWY F CLSD DUE TO SURFACE DAMAGEB6176/19 NOTAMR B4949/19Q) WAAF/QLYAS/IV/M/A/000/999/0234S14031E005A) WAJJ B) 1912190341 C) 2003191100E) TWY LGT NP, D, E AND F U/SGround observer video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j-0SCqpYWQOscillating wheel marks on the runway (Photo: KNKT):The disabled aircraft:Map of movement (Graphics: KNKT):Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):
A Volotea Boeing 717-200, registration EI-FCU performing flight V7-1721 from Pantelleria to Milan Bergamo (Italy) with 95 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Pantelleria's runway 26 when the crew rejected takeoff due to a bird strike followed by the failure of the right hand airspeed indications. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.A post flight inspection revealed a bird had impacted the right hand (first officer's) pitot tube. Following repairs the aircraft was able to depart with a delay of 10 hours.Pantelleria Emergency services reported it appeared a large bird had been ingested by one of the engines (BR715), the crew immediately thereafter applied braking and safely stopped the aircraft.The right hand pitot tube hit by the bird:
A NORRA Nordic Regional Airlines Avions de Transport Regional ATR-72-212A, registration OH-ATE performing flight AY-436 from Oulu to Helsinki (Finland), was accelerating for takeoff from Oulu's runway 30 when the crew rejected takeoff due to smell of smoke on the flight deck. The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway 1300 meters/4300 feet down the runway.The flight was cancelled, the passengers were rebooked onto the afternoon flight about 4:45 hours later.The aircraft remained on the ground for about 29 hours, then positioned to Helsinki.
A Lufthansa Airbus A319-100, registration D-AILU performing flight LH-2004 from Munich to Dusseldorf (Germany), was accelerating for takeoff from Munich's runway 26L when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (84 knots over ground) due to a left hand engine (CFM56) fire warning. The aircraft slowed safely and stopped on the runway. The crew requested emergency services to attend and asked another Lufthansa crew waiting for departure whether they saw any fire/smoke from the left or right hand engine, the crew responded everything looked normal, tower confirmed using binoculars he couldn't see anything out of the ordinary. The crew susbequently taxied the aircraft off the runway and stopped again after crossing the hold short line for an inspection by emergency services. Emergency services reported seeing slightly higher temperatures on the left engine than on the right engine, there were no leaks or contaminations. The crew suspected a false fire warning and taxied the aircraft back to the apron.A replacement A319-100 registration D-AILA reached Dusseldorf with a delay of 100 minutes.The aircraft is still on the ground in Munich about 9 hours after the rejected takeoff.
A Cargolux Boeing 747-400 freighter, registration LX-UCV performing flight CV-7536 from Hong Kong (China) to Baku (Azerbaijan), was accelerating for takeoff from Hong Kong's runway 25R when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed due to an engine (RB211) problem. The aircraft slowed safely, vacated the runway via taxiway A6 about 2000 meters/6560 feet down the runway and stopped on the adjacent parallel taxiway. 4 main tyres deflated due to hot brakes and disabled the aircraft.The aircraft was towed to the apron about 4.5 hours later.
A National Jet Express British Aerospace BAe-146-300, registration VH-NJZ performing flight XM-7443 from Sydney,NS to Brisbane,QL (Australia), departed Sydney's runway 16R, however, the rear tail stand had remained attached and separated during rotation for takeoff, the tail stand came to a stop on the runway surface as foreign object debris. The aircraft climbed to FL250 enroute and landed safely on Brisbane's runway 14 about 90 minutes after departure.Australia's Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) reported: "At about 0455 on 22 January the aircraft took off with the rear tail stand attached. After take-off the tail stand sheared off resulting in foreign object debris on the runway." The aircraft did not sustain damage. The occurrence, described as "Aircraft preparation event", was rated an incident and is being investigated by the ATSB.On Jun 23rd 2020 the ATSB released their final report concluding the probable causes of the incident were:- During pre-departure checks, the full checklist between the captain and engineer was not completed. This negated the value of the checklist as a risk control and resulted in a missed opportunity to identify that the tail strut was still attached to the aircraft prior to it departing the bay.- The engineer had no effective means or procedure to contact the flight crew while the aircraft was taxiing. As a result, the flight crew were not alerted to the error prior to take-off.The ATSB described the sequence of events:A licenced aircraft maintenance engineer employed by Cobham Aviation Services reported marshalling NJZ in, and the flight crew subsequently shut down the aircrafts engines. The engineer placed chocks at the nose wheels and instructed the flight crew to release the parking brake. The engineer positioned boarding stairs at the forward left cabin door and attached a tail strut2 to the rear of the aircraft (Figure 1). The tail strut was part of the Sydney Airport ground support equipment. The engineer also had the option of using a tail strut that was carried on board the aircraft.The engineer reported opening the aft lower cargo hold door, on the rear right side of the aircraft to retrieve the sill protectors.3 The engineer waited for the aircraft freight door to be opened remotely by the captain, installed the sill protectors, and conducted an external visual inspection of NJZ. After the inspection, the engineer engaged in a brief conversation with the flight crew, and returned to the line hut to await completion of loading by the loading team. The captain reported completing an external visual inspection of the aircraft then returned to the cockpit to plan the next sector to Brisbane with the first officer. Upon completion of loading by the loading team, the captain positioned himself at the top of the boarding stairs and the engineer returned to the aircraft. The engineer removed the freight door sill protectors and signalled the captain to commence lowering the freight door. After the freight door was closed, the engineer visually checked that it was flush with the aircraft skin and that the locks had correctly engaged. The engineer then signalled the captain that the freight door had locked correctly. The captain replied with a thumbs-up, entered the aircraft and closed the cabin door behind him.The engineer proceeded to the aft lower cargo hold door on the right side of the aircraft, stowed the sill protectors, closed and locked the cargo hold door. The engineer then walked back around towards the front of the aircraft and positioned the boarding stairs clear. The engineer connected a headset to the nose of the aircraft for communications with the flight crew and removed chocks from the nose landing gear wheels. The engineer then took up a position at the nose of the aircraft to commence communications with the flight crew for engine start.The captain confirmed communications with the engineer, and the engineer responded stowed and closed, you are clear all four. The flight crew proceeded to start all four engines. After the engines were all started successfully, the engineer disconnected the headset, closed the communications panel, and proceeded into the line hut to put away the headset and torch. At 0451, NJZ taxied forward out of the bay and then toward holding point Golf for take-off on runway 16R.At that time, a ground staff member from a different company arrived at the line hut on a tug and informed the engineer that NJZ had commenced taxiing with the tail strut still in place. Leaving the line hut, the engineer proceeded outside and saw that NJZ had commenced taxiing towards the runway. The engineer began pursuing the aircraft on foot, and attempted to attract the captains attention by waving his arms and shouting. The engineer, realising he wouldnt be able to get the pilots attention, joined the ground staff member on the tug and proceeded after NJZ.The engineer did not have a contact number for the Sydney Control Tower and was therefore unable to inform them of the situation quickly. Instead, he telephoned National Jet Express Maintenance Watch5 and asked them to contact the flight crew to inform them of the situation. National Jet Express Maintenance Watch relayed the message to National Jet Express Operations, 6 who in turn attempted unsuccessfully to contact both pilots by mobile phone.The engineer, realising that he was not going to catch NJZ prior to it entering the runway, approached a nearby works safety officer. As the engineer was asking the safety officer to immediately contact the tower via radio, to prevent NJZ from taking off, the aircraft turned onto runway 16R, powered up and departed.The captain reported that during the take-off roll, he felt his phone vibrating in his pocket but did not answer as he was concentrating on the departure.Following the aircrafts departure, Sydney Tower closed Taxiway Bravo and runway 16R to allow a visual inspection to take place. A Sydney Airport ground safety worker subsequently located the tail strut, took photographs, and recovered the multiple components (Figure 2). The photographs of the recovered tail strut components were sent to the engineers mobile phone and the engineer confirmed that the entirety of the tail strut had been recovered. The engineer relayed this information to National Jet Express Maintenance Watch, who passed it on to the captain. The captain, satisfied that the entire tail strut had departed the aircraft, continued the flight to Brisbane. On arrival at Brisbane, air traffic control requested that NJZ land on a secondary runway in case there was any residual part of the tail strut still attached to the aircraft. The aircraft landed and stopped on the runway without incident, and the rear of the aircraft was inspected by a Brisbane Airport ground safety officer. NJZ was then permitted to taxi to its bay. Engineers subsequently inspected the rear of the aircraft and no damage was evident.The ATSB analysed:During pre-departure checks, the verbal exchange between the captain and engineer was not performed in accordance with the Stand-Off Bay Despatch Using Intercom challenge-and-response checklist. While that was possibly the result of it being a routinely performed task, it negated the value of the checklist as a risk control, and presented a missed opportunity to detect the tail strut prior to departure.The engineer had no effective means or procedure to contact the aircraft while it was taxiing. Despite that, he attempted various methods to contact the flight crew but was unable to alert them to the tail strut still being attached to the aircraft prior to take-off.
A British Airways Airbus A319-100, registration G-EUPL performing flight BA-466 from London Heathrow,EN (UK) to Madrid,SP (Spain), rotated for takeoff from Heathrow's runway 27R when a strong chemical odour developed in cockpit and cabin. The crew completed the initial climb, then ran the relevant checklist, the odour dissipated, cabin crew also confirmed the odour was dissipating, the whole event lasted for about 2 minutes, due to the short duration neither flight crew had donned their oxygen masks or cabin crew their protective equipment. As the odour had subsided the crew decided to continue the flight. Enroute while nearing Spain both flight crew realized they felt dizzy, had difficulties in concentrating and were feeling increasingly tired and exhausted. Some cabin crew in the meantime inexplicably poured water onto the galley top instead of into the sink. The aircraft managed a safe landing on Madrid's runway 32L about 2 hours after departure.Medlink instructed the crew to use portable oxygen for 20 minutes each.The aircraft remained on the ground for about 3 hours, then departed for the return flight to London. After the return to London the aircraft remained on the ground for 4.5 hours, then resumed service.https://flightaware.com/live/flight/BAW466/history/20200216/0845Z/EGLL/LEMD
A Kalitta Charters Boeing 737-400 freighter, registration N733CK performing flight KI-822 from Rochester,NY to Hartford,CT (USA) with 3 crew, was cleared for takeoff from Rochester's runway 22 and in the initial acceleration for takeoff at 09:11L (13:11Z) when the aircraft veered left off the runway, the crew rejected takeoff, and the aircraft came to a stop with all gear on soft ground about 130 feet to the left of the runway centerline and about 750 feet down the runway. There were no injuries, the aircraft received minor if any damage. The captain explained they were lined up, when the copilot applied thrust the aircraft veered to the left. Rochester Airport Firefighters reported: "Airport Fire fighters currently handling a Ground Incident for a 737 into the grass off of runway 22." and reported according to radio transmissions a mechanical issue occurred prior to veering off the runway.On Jun 8th 2020 the FAA reported: "AIRCRAFT ON DEPARTURE VEERED OFF RUNWAY, ROCHESTER, NY." and rated the occurrence an incident.Related NOTAMs:!ROC 06/044 ROC RWY 10/28 CLSD 2006051115-2006052300!ROC 06/046 ROC TWY A CLSD 2006051340-2006062300!ROC 06/045 ROC RWY 04/22 CLSD 2006051338-2006062300Metars:KROC 051554Z 23006KT 10SM FEW040 SCT250 27/18 A2986 RMK AO2 SLP112 T02670178 $=KROC 051454Z 24004KT 10SM FEW045 SCT250 26/18 A2986 RMK AO2 SLP112 T02560178 51003 $=KROC 051354Z 27006KT 10SM FEW250 24/18 A2986 RMK AO2 SLP112 T02440178 $=KROC 051254Z 24008KT 10SM FEW180 23/18 A2986 RMK AO2 SLP109 T02280183 $=KROC 051154Z 24009KT 10SM FEW180 21/18 A2986 RMK AO2 SLP109 T02110178 10211 20178 50008 $=KROC 051054Z 23006KT 10SM FEW090 FEW180 FEW250 19/17 A2986 RMK AO2 SLP112 T01940172 $=KROC 050954Z 23006KT 10SM FEW090 SCT180 SCT250 18/17 A2985 RMK AO2 SLP108 T01780172 $=KROC 050854Z 23006KT 10SM FEW080 SCT180 BKN250 18/17 A2983 RMK AO2 SLP101 T01830172 50006 $=The aircraft off the runway on soft ground (Photo: ROC Airport Firefighters):
An Azores Airlines Airbus A320-200, registration CS-TKP performing flight S4-6128 from Ponta Delgada to Lisbon (Portugal), was accelerating for takeoff from Ponta Delgada's runway 30 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 116 knots over ground) after the left hand engine (CFM56) ingested a bird. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The aircraft is still on the ground in Ponta Delgada about 77 hours (3 days and 5 hours) later.The left hand engine received substantial damage.On Jun 2nd 2020 The Aviation Herald learned the crew rejected takeoff due to strong vibrations from the left hand side and a high pitched noise. The aircraft slowed and stopped at about mid point of the runway. Substantial vibrations from the left hand (#1) engine continued even at idle thrust. Following inspection by emergency services the aircraft taxied to the apron, where passengers disembarked normally. A post flight examination of the engine revealed substantial damage to engine blades and surrounding panels.The damage to the engine:
A Western Global Boeing 747-400 freighter, registration N344KD performing flight KD-3367 from Amsterdam (Netherlands) to Chicago O'Hare,IL (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Amsterdam's runway 36L when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 40 knots), slowed and vacated the runway to the right. Airport vehicles responded and reported Kerosene seen coming off the left wing tip of the aircraft. Emergency services responded but reported seeing nothing out of the ordinary. The aircraft subsequently returned to the apron.About 20 minutes later the crew attempted to depart on runway 36L again, however, needed to again reject takeoff at low speed. The crew now reported they again had a body gear steering issue and needed to return to the apron.The aircraft was able to depart for the flight about 4.5 hours after the first rejected takeoff.Ground observer video of both rejected takeoffs (Video: TheYottaTube):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYjDWGdmmQE
An Air Canada Airbus A319-100, registration C-FYKR performing flight AC-992 from Mexico City (Mexico) to Toronto,ON (Canada) with 85 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Mexico's runway 05L when the crew rejected takeoff between 60 and 70 KIAS after noticing the left hand engine (CFM56) surged. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The flight was cancelled.
An Allegiant Air Airbus A320-200, registtration N222NV performing flight G4-271 from Allentown,PA to Saint Petersburg,FL (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from runway 06 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed reporting a bird strike about one quarter down the runway. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.A replacement A320-200 registration N230NV reached Saint Petersburg with a delay of 2.5 hours.The FAA reported the aircraft sustained minor damage.
A Hong Kong Airlines Airbus A330-300, registration B-LNM performing flight HX-765 from Hong Kong (China) to Bangkok (Thailand), was lined up on runway 25L for departure cleared for takeoff.A Fedex Federal Express McDonnell Douglas MD-11, registration N595FE performing flight FX-9741 (dep May 21st) from Anchorage,AK (USA) to HOng Kong (China), was on final approach to Hong Kong's runway 25L when the crew initiated a go around from about 250 feet AGL, about 0.7nm before the runway threshold, due to the Airbus A330-300 still on the runway just commencing their takeoff run.The A330 continued their takeoff, became airborne and was restricted to climb to 2000 feet by ATC. The MD-11 overtook the A330 over the runway and was ahead of the A333 by about 0.5nm when the A333 climbed just past the runway end, the vertical separation between the aircraft was 800 feet at that point. The conflict was resolved shortly afterwards when the MD-11 had sufficiently climbed to establish more than 1000 feet vertical separation between the aircraft, at which point the A330 was cleared to continue climb, both aircraft were vectored onto diverging trajectories.The MD-11 positioned for another approach to runway 25L and landed without further incident about 23 minutes after the go around.The A330 continued to Bangkok for a safe landing without further incident.Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department rated the occurrence a serious incident and opened an investigation.Metars:VHHH 221200Z VRB02KT 9000 FEW014 28/25 Q1004 NOSIG=VHHH 221130Z 20003KT 170V230 9000 FEW014 27/25 Q1004 NOSIG=VHHH 221100Z 25004KT 8000 FEW014 28/25 Q1004 NOSIG=VHHH 221030Z 25005KT 8000 FEW011 27/25 Q1003 NOSIG=VHHH 221000Z 24003KT 9999 FEW013 28/25 Q1003 NOSIG=VHHH 220930Z VRB03KT 230V300 9999 FEW025 28/25 Q1003 NOSIG=VHHH 220900Z 28004KT 250V320 9999 FEW025 28/25 Q1002 NOSIG=VHHH 220830Z VRB03KT 9999 FEW015 SCT040 28/25 Q1002 NOSIG=VHHH 220800Z VRB02KT 9999 FEW015 SCT035 28/25 Q1002 NOSIG=VHHH 220730Z 33003KT 290V360 9999 FEW016 SCT030 28/25 Q1002 NOSIG=VHHH 220700Z 27005KT 9999 FEW016 SCT030 27/24 Q1003 NOSIG=VHHH 220630Z 26007KT 9999 FEW018 SCT030 27/24 Q1003 NOSIG=VHHH 220600Z 26005KT 230V290 9999 FEW018 SCT040 27/24 Q1003 NOSIG=Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):
An Air Atlanta Icelandic Boeing 747-400 freighter on behalf of Saudi Arabian Airlines, registration TF-AMN performing flight CC-375/SV-375 from Frankfurt/Main (Germany) to Dubai Al Maktoum (United Arab Emirates), was accelerating for takeoff from Frankfurt's runway 07R when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (129 knots over ground). The aircraft slowed and stopped on the runway, emergency services responded and cooled the brakes.The aircraft remained on the ground for about 3 hours, then departed and reached Dubai with a delay of about 3 hours.The aircraft stopped on the parallel taxiway: 
A British Airways Airbus A321-200, registration G-EUXJ performing flight BA-1493 from Glasgow,SC to London Heathrow,EN (UK) with 208 passengers and 8 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Glasgow's runway 05 when both pilots felt, the aircraft wasn't accelerating as expected, at about 100 KIAS the first officer asked "Have we got enough power?" At 137 KIAS the ocmmander applied TOGA, the aircraft rotated and passed the runway end at 276 feet AGL. The flight continued to destination without further incident.The AAIB released their bulletin concluding the probable cause of the serious incident was:The investigation found the incorrect entry was probably a result of distraction during the data entry. The subsequent standard procedures and checks did not detect the error. The AAIB described the sequence of events:During passenger boarding the flight crew had a few minutes spare, so, as encouraged by the operator, the commander allowed a couple of passengers to visit the flight deck.Later, whilst the flight crew were entering the takeoff performance figures into the FMGC the senior cabin crew member asked if they could accept another flight deck visitor. The commander ignored the request and focused on the data entry but, he reported, it may have distracted him.The takeoff was planned from the full length of Runway 05. The surface wind was from 080° at 5 kt, the visibility was 2,800 m in drizzle with cloud broken at 400 ft. The temperature was 8°C and the runway surface was wet. The takeoff performance calculation required flap 1, a flex temperature of 49°C, a non-standard acceleration altitude of 1,070 ft and takeoff speeds of V1 139 kt, VR 147 kt and V2 151 kt.The flight crew completed the flight deck preparations and the aircraft was pushed back from the stand on time at 1803 hrs. At 1808 hrs the flight crew received their final load sheet which was consistent with the provisional figures. During taxi air traffic control asked if they could depart from Intersection F as another aircraft was holding at Taxiway G with a technical problem. However, before the flight crew changed the performance figures the crew of the other aircraft resolved their problem and it was able to depart.G-EUXJ continued to the full length of the runway and the flight crew completed the before takeoff checklist. As they started the takeoff roll, their standard review of the Flight Mode Annunciators (FMA) was interrupted by several radio transmissions.During the takeoff roll both pilots reported that they felt something was wrong, they felt the aircraft was not accelerating as they expected. The commander reported that something was not right but I could not put my finger on it. At approximately 100 kt the co-pilot verbalised this does not feel right, have we got enough power. At 137 kt the commander advanced the thrust levers to TOGA power. The co-pilot recalled the aircraft had entered the last 900 m of the runway when the aircraft rotated. Subsequent flight data showed that the aircraft crossed the upwind end of the runway at 276 ft. The aircraft continued to Heathrow without further incident.After takeoff, the flight crew realised they had entered a flex temperature of 79°C instead of 49°C.The AAIB analysed:The flight crew inadvertently entered a flex temperature of 79° instead of 49°. The error was not detected during the subsequent procedures and checks.The error was likely made due to a combination of brief distraction and entering a non‑standard acceleration height. The subsequent checks do not require the flight crew to refer back to the source data and, whilst the selected flex temperature was unusual for a A321, it was not usual for the A319 which the flight crew had been operating during the tour.The flight crew realised there was insufficient power during the takeoff roll and applied TOGA power.The operator has reminded its pilots about the hazard of distraction during critical data loading and are reviewing their procedures to improve the likelihood that data entry errors are detected.
A Sky Regional Airlines Embraer ERJ-175, registration C-FEJB performing flight RS-7665 from Toronto,ON (Canada) to Dallas Ft. Worth,TX (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Toronto's runway 06L when tower instructed the crew to reject takeoff. The crew complied, rejected takeoff and brought the aircraft to a stop just short of the intersection of runway 06L and taxiway C2.The Canadian TSB reported a convoy of snow ploughs and sweepers had been operating north of runway 06L and proceeded southbound on taxiway E. Ground control instructed the convoy to turn left onto taxiway C (parallel to runway 06L), the vehicles turned left, however onto taxiway C2 (high speed turn off from runway 24R) and were moving towards runway 06L crossing the hold short line. Ground control instructed the vehicles to stop, the vehicles stopped just short of the runway edge. Tower at the same time instructed the Embraer to abort takeoff.On May 13th 2020 the Canadian TSB released their final report concluding the probable causes of the serious incident were:Findings as to causes and contributing factorsThese are conditions, acts or safety deficiencies that were found to have caused or contributed to this occurrence.- The transponder installed on PLOW 862 was not updated to remove the code from the vehicle on which it had previously been installed. As a result, the incorrect code was shown on the ground controllers display.- NAV CANADA did not have procedures in place to track or report vehicle transponder errors to the Greater Toronto Airports Authority.- Due to the reduced visibility from blowing snow, the operator of PLOW 862 was not aware that the vehicle was on Taxiway C2 as it approached the holding position. As a result, the operator was not looking for, nor expecting to see, any of the visual cues that would have alerted him that the vehicle was approaching an active runway.- Because some of the visual cues at the holding position were obscured by snow, and others may not have been working, the cues were not conspicuous enough to alert the operator of PLOW 862 to the vehicles proximity to the runway. As a result, PLOW 862 and the following 2 vehicles incurred on the protected area of the runway.- The ground controller recognized the incursion by PLOW 862 and instructed the vehicle to stop 4 times; however, the first 2 instructions were addressed to PLOW 170 rather than PLOW 862. Immediately after the ground controller used the correct call sign, PLOW 862 came to a stop 10 seconds and 270 feet after crossing the holding position on Taxiway C2.Findings as to riskThese are conditions, unsafe acts or safety deficiencies that were found not to be a factor in this occurrence but could have adverse consequences in future occurrences.- If air traffic controllers use abbreviated phraseology when issuing safety-critical instructions, there is a risk that the instruction will not be recognized or followed by flight crews.Other findingsThese items could enhance safety, resolve an issue of controversy, or provide a data point for future safety studies.- The vehicle operators did not have access to any real-time navigation displays to assist with navigating the various taxiways and runways, such as moving maps or a global positioning system.The TSB analysed:All 4 of the vehicle operators were experienced in operating vehicles on the airport manoeuvring areas, and there was no misunderstanding of the air traffic control (ATC) instruction, where the vehicles were authorized to work, and the intended route.The vehicle operators did not have access to any real-time navigation displays to assist with navigating the various taxiways and runways, such as moving maps or a GPS (global positioning system). The operators were knowledgeable about the area but were driving in conditions of reduced visibility.The operator of the lead vehicle, PLOW 862, was instructed to proceed east on Taxiway C. However, after making a wide left turn to position snow near the south edge of the taxiway, he inadvertently turned onto Taxiway C2. Believing he was on Taxiway C, he continued onto Taxiway C2, and due to the limited visibility the other vehicles followed.Due to the reduced visibility from blowing snow, the operator of PLOW 862 was not aware that the vehicle was on Taxiway C2 as it approached the holding position. As a result, the operator was not looking for, nor expecting to see, any of the visual cues that would have alerted him that the vehicle was approaching an active runway.In addition to the reduced visibility, Taxiway C2 was covered in snow, which obscured the paint markings and the inset stop-bar lights. When investigators later examined the location, it was noticed that 1 light in each pair of elevated stop-bar lights was not working. Although it could not be determined if these lights were operating on the day of the occurrence, the reduced lighting likely would have further reduced the conspicuity of the holding position.Because some of the visual cues at the holding position were obscured by snow, and others may not have been working, the cues were not conspicuous enough to alert the operator of PLOW 862 to the vehicles proximity to the runway. As a result, PLOW 862 and the following 2 vehicles incurred on the protected area of the runway.The Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA) conducted a risk analysis in 2012 regarding vehicle transponders and identified vehicle mismatch as a hazard. As a result, standard operating procedures (SOPs) were developed to prevent the situation from occurring in future. The SOPs in effect for installing and testing the transponders include programming a code for the new transponder and then using web-based software to check that the code is correct before the vehicle is operated on the manoeuvring area. Once the transponder and vehicle are operational, the vehicle operators have no method of checking the software themselves to verify that the transponder is displaying the correct code.Normally the GTAA installs new transponder units in new vehicles that are to be operated on the manoeuvring areas of the airport. However, in this case there were no new transponders available, and so a used transponder was installed. Transferring of transponders between vehicles is not common; the majority of the installations are new units, and therefore would not have a transponder code pre-programmed in the unit. The used transponder was checked for proper operation and deemed to be serviceable before it was installed on PLOW 862, although it was programmed with the code PLOW 170.The transponder installed on PLOW 862 was not updated to remove the code from the vehicle on which it had previously been installed (i.e., PLOW 170). As a result, the incorrect code was shown on the ground controllers display.Before the introduction of the advanced surface movement guidance and control system (A-SMGCS), the ground radar system at Toronto/Lester B. Pearson International Airport (CYYZ) was based on primary surveillance radar. At that time, vehicles did not have transponder codes, so controllers were used to seeing the targets without these codes appearing as tags on their displays. Over time, some targets began to have tags associated with them, but controllers were still using the extended computer display system (EXCDS) screen to get call sign information. Consequently, when there was a mismatch between the tag on the A-SMGCS display and the vehicle call sign, although controllers initially reported these errors to vehicle operators, they did not deem it a serious ongoing hazard.At the time of the occurrence, the NAV CANADA control tower at CYYZ did not have procedures to follow if there was a mismatch between a vehicle call sign and its transponder code. It was reported that when the transponder program began, ATC would often challenge a vehicle that had a wrong or missing code; however, this could not be verified. In addition, there were no records available regarding the frequency or number of transponder code and vehicle call sign mismatches. Over time as fewer challenges were received, the GTAA assumed that fewer mismatches were occurring. Even though PLOW 862 had an incorrect transponder code for 7 weeks, the error was not identified or reported to the GTAA.NAV CANADA did not have procedures in place to track or report vehicle transponder errors to the GTAA.When the ground controller observed the vehicles crossing the holding position at Taxiway C2 on the A-SMGCS display screen, he used the call sign associated with the target (PLOW 170) when instructing the plow operator to stop. When the ground controller did not receive a response, he referred to the EXCDS screen and obtained the correct call sign (PLOW 862).The ground controller recognized the incursion by PLOW 862 and instructed the vehicle to stop 4 times; however, the first 2 instructions were addressed to PLOW 170 rather than PLOW 862. Immediately after the ground controller used the correct call sign, but 10 seconds and 270 feet after crossing the holding position on Taxiway C2, PLOW 862 came to a stop.Situation (Graphic: TSB):Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):
A Gol Transportes Aereos Boeing 737-800, registration PR-GTN performing flight G3-1732 from Brasilia,DF to Sao Luis,MA (Brazil) with 154 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Brasilia's runway 11L when the crew recognized the previous landing, an air force aircraft, was still on the runway near taxiway F. The Boeing continued takeoff passing close to the air force plane and landed in Sao Luis without further incident.Brazil's CENIPA rated the occurrence a serious incident and opened an investigation.On Apr 13th 2018 The Aviation Herald received additional information stating the air force Embraer C-95 Bandeirante (ICAO E110) had landed on runway 11L advising they were planning to vacate via taxiway G (1465 meters down the runway). ATC instructed to vacate the runway via G and contact ground when clear of the runway. However, the E110 continued to taxiway F (1975 meters down the runway) and reported they were clear of the runway at G and contacted ground. The controller was unable to see taxiways F and G and based on the position report cleared the Boeing for takeoff. The crew could not see the E110 due to the curvature of the runway and commenced takeoff, seeing the E110 only at the highest point of the curvature when the Boeing had already accelerated through V1. The Boeing crew rotated their aircraft ahead of the E110.On May 10th 2020 Brazil's CENIPA released their final report dated Dec 18th 2019 concluding the probable causes of the serious incident were:Attention  a contributor.The attention of the Tower controller was hampered by the context in his work routine in which, due to physical obstacles, expectations were created that the aircraft would follow the instructions sent, even if they could not visually accompany them from their position, as happened in this case.The fact that the Tower controller did not identify that the FAB, after having read back that it would clear by the TWY "G", did not do so, demonstrated that his focus of attention was not properly oriented to the situation.In addition, the Ground controller did not identify that the aircraft, when at the first contact in his frequency, remained on the runway in use.Attitude  undetermined.Despite the good technical preparation, the FAB 2345 copilot still showed little familiarity with the SBBR operation at night. This may have contributed to the fact that she did not contest the instructions received from the commander regarding the taxi sequence after landing on runway 11L, as regards the selection of the TWY to clear the runway in use. Likewise, the attitude of not following the standard phraseology prescribed in the MCA 100-16/2016, by the Tower controller, may have contributed to the FAB 2345 crew carrying out the frequency change for the Ground Control, before its exit from the runway in use.Communication  a contributor.Even not comprehending the request of the FAB 2345 crew after landing, the Tower controller did not urge them to repeat the message and issued instructions for the aircraft to clear the runway on TWY "G" (Golf), considering the proximity that the aircraft was from that intersection.In this case, there was a selective listening, in which the spoken content was deduced from what was expected to be heard in that type of situation.The message received by the FAB crew to "clear on Golf" may have been mistaken for a denial of the TWY "C" (Charlie) request.Furthermore, the non-assimilation by the Ground controller of the verbal (future) time used by the crew of the FAB aircraft, by communicating the intersection where they would clear, contributed to the fact that he did not realize the aircraft was on the runway in use.Physical work-conditions  a contributor.The light interference from the North Pier apron and the TWY "H" blind spot (Hotel) constituted physical characteristics of the Tower's workplace that compromised the safe operating performance considering the nighttime operation.Air Traffic Coordination (ATS)  a contributor.The inadequate exchange of information between the Tower controller and the Ground Control in relation to the Air Force aircraft after its landing has contributed to the uncertainty as to the actual positioning of that traffic.Employment of ATS means  undetermined.Despite all difficulties identified for the visualization of the C-95M on the runway, the Tower controller did not use the resource prevised at ICA 100-37/2017, which provided an instruction for the aircraft itself to report when it had cleared the runway in use. It is possible that the employment of this means could prevent the incident.Use of phraseology by ATS  undetermined.It is possible that the phraseology used by the Tower controller, when he instructed the crew of the FAB 2345 to call the Ground Control, without conditioning this act to the exit of the aircraft of the runway in use, has induced the pilots to make the exchange of frequency being still on the respective runway.With this action, the military pilots were unable to interfere when the Tower improperly authorized the 737 takeoff while the runway was still occupied.ATS Control Ability  a contributor.There was no ability in performing ATS procedures, such as visual scanning and phraseology usage that exhausted the possibilities of identifying an aircraft on the runway at the time of the PR-GTN takeoff.Airport infrastructure  a contributor.The existence of several blind spots at the aerodrome contributed to the Tower controller inferring that the FAB 2345 was in a position different from its real location after landing.The cameras used to mitigate the risk of blind spots did not cover all areas and were not dedicated exclusively to the use of the TWR-BR.The lighting of some aprons obfuscated the view of the TWR-BR controllers, damaging the sighting of the aircraft, especially small ones.All these conditions, combined with the absence of a RADAR Surface Movement System, contributed to the military aircraft not being noticed on the runway in use at the time of the PR-GTN take-off was authorized.Clearance limit  a contributor.Involuntarily, the crew of the FAB 2345 did not comply with the Tower instruction to clear the runway by the TWY "G" (Golf).The remaining on the runway in use by the military aircraft, in spite of a different instruction from the controller, contributed to the incident.Perception  a contributor.The similarity between the letters "C" and "G" associated with the conditions for their visualization at the night period contributed to the pilot's misperception.The controller's perception was reduced by his expectation that the crew would strictly follow the guidance.In addition, the failure to view the aircraft due to the TWY "H" (Hotel) blind spot led him to conclude that the runway was clear for another operation.The expectation of not finding the aircraft in the runway in use reduced the controller's perception of the real location of that airplane, contributing to the ending of this occurrence.Insufficient pilots experience  undetermined.The lack of familiarity of the FAB 2345 copilot with the aerodrome may have contributed for her not questioning the commander's message, requesting to clear the runway for the TWY "C" (Charlie) when, in fact, the intersection they passed by was the TWY "G" (Golf).It is possible that the little experience of that copilot had induced her to faithfully follow the commander's guidance.Support systems  undetermined.No regulation was identified that explicitly defined the position in which the aircraft should perform the frequency change for the Ground Control after landing.The lack of prediction in standards may have contributed to the FAB 2345 crew keeping the Ground Control frequency while occupying the runway in use.CENIPA reported the military aircraft had landed on runway 11L. CENIPA wrote: the FAB 2345 pilot visualized the letter "C" on the taxiway's signposting plate and therefore asked the copilot (crewmember responsible for communications) to ask the TWR-BR to authorize them to clear the runway by the TWY "C" (Charlie).In response to the crew of the military aircraft request, the TWR-BR controller directed the aircraft to clear on the TWY "G" and call the Ground control.After receiving the message from the Tower, the FAB 2345 crew decided not to clear the runway in that position where the aircraft was already moving, switched the frequency to the GND-BR channel and remained on the main runway until the next exit intersection.The military crew made initial contact with the GND-BR while still taxing on the main runway toward the next exit intersection and reported on that frequency that it would clear the runway through the TWY "G" (Golf).The controller (GND-BR), in turn, only reported that he was aware and authorized the taxi of the aircraft to the military apron.By identifying, through reading the runway vertical signaling, that the next intersection was TWY "F" (Foxtrot) and not TWY "G" (Golf), the crew rectified the message they had passed to the GND- BR, requesting to clear the runway by TWY "F" (Foxtrot).Once again, the controller (GND-BR) authorized the departure of the aircraft from the main runway and the taxi to the military apron.As the aircraft began to position itself toward TWY "F" (Foxtrot) to clear the runway, the occupants of that military aircraft suddenly perceived a very intense light coming from outside, accompanied by an extremely loud noise and a strong vibration.As they looked out the window, some of the crew and passengers sighted the commercial plane that had just passed over the C-95M that still occupied the main runway....After the FAB 2345 landing, the TWR-BR authorized the PR-GTN to line up and maintain threshold 11L and, about one minute and fifteen seconds later, the same controller (TWR-BR) authorized its takeoff.The PR-GTN crew began the take-off run, and almost at the same time the Boeing reached the speed of rotation, its landing light illuminated the FAB C-95M, which was still on the runway.Then, the PR-GTN commander advanced the power levers for the maximum thrust and immediately started the rotation, managing to take off his aircraft above the one on the runway, thus avoiding a collision.After avoiding the accident, still in the frequency of TWR-BR, the PR-GTN crew reported to that traffic control the scenario that they had just confronted.CENIPA analysed:During the approach and landing briefing by the FAB aircraft commander, while still on a cruise flight, he stated that after the touchdown, he would control the deceleration of the aircraft, in order to clear the main runway through TWY "F" (Foxtrot).This decision was based on the arguments that TWY "F", by virtue of its angulation in relation to the direction of landing, would be a quick exit intersection (for landings on runway 11L) and also because that taxiway would allow a more direct access to the Brasilia military apron.Considering the landing performance of the military aircraft and the runway length from the touch zone (from threshold 11L) to TWY "F", the pilot could plan a fairly smooth deceleration as it would have a great distance to degrade the speed which was not very high (low performance aircraft).However, it was found that during the landing, the pilot used the reverse and brake controls at an intensity higher than that, which would be required for the aircraft to be at a controlled speed in a position close to TWY "F".After controlling the aircraft, in an earlier position than previously planned, the pilot tried to identify, by reading the vertical signs of the aerodrome, what would be the new intersection that he would use to clear the runway.However, when he glanced quickly at the identification plate of the intersection he would be able to use, he confused the letter "G" with the letter "C" and therefore asked the copilot to request TWR-BR the authorization to clear the runway by the intersection that he believed to be TWY "C" (Charlie).It should be noted that this type of distorted perception is plausible, considering the similarity of the letters and the conditions of visualization, which, in this case, were aggravated by the fact that it was a night period.In this case, in theory, the pilot would not have failed to comply with item 6.7.1.5.2 of the ICA 100-37/2017, which dealt with the procedures to be adopted for situations of "Uncertainty about position in the maneuvering area", because when he saw (even if incorrectly) the vertical signaling for the taxiway that he wished to enter, there was no uncertainty in his judgment.Some conditions may have contributed to the copilot not responding to thecommander's misguided request, such as her lack of familiarity with the aerodrome, the actual existence of a TWY "C" (Charlie) connected to that runway and her attention which was aimed at performing the after-landing check, rather than assisting in following the aircraft roll.It was not possible to clarify whether the SBBR ADC chart consultation was fully explored at the time of the approach and landing briefing performed by the FAB 2345 pilot, as well as its use during the taxi. In this context, the lack of real-time monitoring of this chart by the copilot, may have contributed to the incorrect perception of the aircraft position on the ground after landing.Allied to these conditions, it is possible that the little familiarity of the copilot with the operation in SBBR at night has contributed for her to exert little interference on the actions of the pilot.Thus, the copilot followed strictly what was requested by the commander and questioned the Tower about the possibility of clearing the runway by TWY "C" (Charlie).In turn, the Tower controller was not expecting to receive any message from the aircraft that had just landed, because at controlled aerodromes, normally the first post-landing message is sent by the Tower rather than by the aircraft.In addition, in the controllers perception, the copilot had sent the message (of a request to clear on the TWY "C") with a rapid pace of speech, which made it impossible to understand the information.Despite not being able to understand the content of the message sent by the military aircrafts copilot, the controller did not request that the crew repeat the phraseology, because it inferred that the pilots should only be informing that the aircraft was controlled.The correct attitude in this situation would be a Tower controller request to have the message repeated by the crew, in order to avoid communication conflicts.In the real context, the controller disregarded the crew message, which was erroneously requesting to clear the runway through TWY "C" (Charlie) and simply sent the standard message it would already use, even if it had not been surprised by the initial call of the aircraft on the ground.When verbalizing: "Pioneer 45, clear on the Golf and call Ground on frequency 121.8.", the controller experienced the following context:- visualized a fully controlled aircraft, having a compatible speed to immediately clear the runway;- inferred that the aircraft had reported that it was already controlled;- the exit intersection next to that already controlled aircraft was TWY "G" (Golf);- had observed the trajectory of the aircraft, moving to enter in TWY "G" (Golf); and - after his post-landing instruction, there was the correctly read back by the crew, reporting that they would clear the runway by the TWY "G" (Golf).However, from the crew's perspective, the message conveyed by the controller represented a totally different context.In fact, the aircraft was controlled and the crew would clear the runway through TWY "G" (Golf), as the controller could observe from the Tower.However, mistakenly believing that TWY "G" (Golf) was TWY "C" (Charlie), upon hearing the controller's "Clear on the Golf" message, after the request to clear on Charlie, the crew interpreted the phraseology as negative to their request, which may have sounded like: do not clear on TWY "C" (Charlie), but on TWY "G" (Golf).Considering that TWY "G" (Golf) was located on the next exit on the right, after TWY "C" (in the direction of aircraft landing), the pilots interpreted that they should clear the runway by the next exit on the right and not by the one which was already in its side.Soon, in fact, the crew stopped joining TWY "G" (Golf) and headed towards TWY "F" (Foxtrot).Another communication problem occurred due to the same message sent by the Tower, but referring to the moment of the frequency change for the Ground Control.From the point of view of the Tower controller, as the aircraft was already on the verge of clearing the runway by the TWY "G" (Golf), the pilots could already listen to the Ground Control.Thus, using the additive conjunction "and" in the phrase "clear on the Golf and call Ground at frequency 121.8", the controller was inferring that the aircraft was already clearing the runway in use, and consequently, could change the frequency as soon as passing the stop bar of the intersection in question.In this context, the Tower controller did not use the standard phraseology prevised in item 3.4.3.4 of the MCA 100-16/2016 Phraseology, which presented in its model an example of instruction after landing, conditioning the frequency change at the exit of the aircraft from the runway in use, as already presented in section 1.19 (Additional information) of this Final Report.Nevertheless, from the perspective of the FAB aircraft pilots, upon receiving the determination of the Tower controller to clear on the Golf and call Ground Control on the 121.8MHz frequency, they may have internalized that, from that moment, they would be authorized to perform the two actions (clear the runway and change the frequency to call the Ground Control) without one being necessarily conditioned to the other.However, because of the aforementioned FAB 2345 crew's misunderstanding regarding TWY positioning, the additive conjunction used in the controller's message, rather than a conditional one, may have contributed to the copilot carrying out the frequency change for the Ground Control with the aircraft still occupying the main runway.By switching the frequency to the Ground Control, still occupying the main runway, the military aircraft stopped listening to the Boeing 737's flight, controller's authorization to take off, and thus were unable to interfere with that inadequate clearance given by the Tower.Such a situation would not occur if the controller had conditioned the call at the new frequency to clear the main runway, using phraseologies such as: "When cleared on Golf, call Ground on frequency 121.8"; or, "After clearing on Golf, call Ground on frequency 121.8"; or "When you clear on Golf, call the Ground on frequency 121.8".From this moment on, it is necessary to go back a bit in the chronology of the event, in order to understand the factors that contributed (or may have contributed) to the failure of the Tower controller when authorizing the takeoff of an aircraft, with the runway still occupied by other traffic.There was that moment in which the controller visualized the FAB controlled aircraft, after the landing, next to TWY "G" (Golf) and therefore sent the message so that the crew cleared the runway by that intersection, even without having understood that the crew had requested to clear on TWY "C" (Charlie).However, when the controller received the correct read back of the instruction, even though it was sent in a synthesized manner by the military crew, he temporarily stopped focusing his attention to C-95M, considering that his orientation (which was "repeated" by the FABs copilot) would be strictly enforced.It turns out that the Tower controllers were already accustomed to working with a marginal operating scenario, where a grove on the side of TWY "H" (Hotel) prevented the visualization of a controlled stretch of this taxiway as already shown in Figures 3 and 4.When attempting to see the FAB 2345 near TWY "G" (Golf) and not see it, the controller immediately inferred that the aircraft should be hidden in the blind spot of TWY "H" (Hotel), since it would be moving to the military apron.Therefore, in the context experienced by the controller, not having seen the aircraft on the taxiway meant that plane should be hidden behind the grove, not that the aircraft could still be on the main runway.However, according to the Tower controller himself, even believing that the aircraft was already in TWY "H" (Hotel), he made a visual check of the main runway before authorizing the PR-GTN for takeoff, since according to item 6.13 .2.1 of ICA 100-37/2017, take-off could only be authorized with the runway totally clear.In this context, some factors may have contributed to the fact that the controller had not sighted the C-95M, considering the hypothesis that a visual scan was actually performed on the main runway prior to the commercial aircraft takeoff.The first factor is related to a psychological aspect called expectation, which occurs when an individual projects in a given situation what he or she really expected to encounter at first.Therefore, the controller may have been encouraged to believe that the runway was clear since it was expected that the FAB aircraft would have left the site, thus leading to its non-sighting, due to the TWY "H" (Hotel) blind spot.CENIPA further analysed that the spotlights at the apron as well as the camouflage paint scheme as well as lack of strobe lights (only the red position light present) of the small military aircraft impaired the controllers' ability to identify the aircraft.CENIPA continued analysis:To trigger the analysis of the event, now from the viewpoint of the Ground controller, it is necessary to go back to the moment when the crew of the FAB 2345 made the initial call on the frequency 121.8 MHz, sending the following message:"Brasilia Ground, good evening! Pioneer 45 landed on 11L. It will clear on the "Golf" to the military apron."(our emphasis).Although the crew used the verb tense in the future, when they said they would clear the runway through TWY "G" (Golf), the Ground Controller probably did not realize that the message implied in essence the information that the aircraft would still be on the runway in use. Otherwise, if the aircraft was already off the runway, the verbal time employed by the crew would be in the past with a message containing something like: "... cleared on "Golf"...".Therefore, it is possible to establish the hypothesis that the Ground Controller probably did not visually follow the C-95M movement after the initial call made on his frequency, because if he had done so, he would have realized that, at the moment the pilots reported they would clear the runway through the TWY "G" (Golf), the aircraft had already passed through that intersection.It is inferred that, at the moment the initial call was made in the Ground Control frequency, the FAB aircraft was already in the process of displacing to TWY "F" (Foxtrot), since there was a lapse of about twenty seconds from the Tower's message (00h30min33s UTC) until that first contact with the Ground Control (00h30min53s UTC).Considering that the crew of FAB 2345 believed that TWY "G" was the next to its right, in theory, any trajectory of that military aircraft, from that moment on, he would already be characterized as a displacement for TWY "F" (Foxtrot).Therefore, if the Ground controller had noticed that the aircraft had already passed the TWY "G", would be able to rectify the message sent by the military crew and warn the Tower controller about the presence of the aircraft on the runway and with these actions, perhaps even avoiding the incident.It should be noted that the interferences related to the work environment, experienced by the Ground Controller, were the same as those of the Tower controller, since both operated from the same tower.With respect to PR-GTN CENIPA analysed:In turn, the scenario experienced by the PR-GTN crew involved in the occurrence also contained some influencing conditions for the serious incident.The first of them was the receipt of the takeoff authorization from the Tower controller, because in aviation, there is the common understanding that a controller would only authorize a takeoff with the runway totally cleared.Even so, the authorization of a controller does not inhibit the commander's responsibility to ensure the safety of the flight.Therefore, if in this case the presence of the FAB aircraft still in the runway was noticed, the pilot should not takeoff, in spite of the instruction of the controller authorizing the takeoff.However, because of the runway slope, it would not be possible for a crew to see a small aircraft at a position close to the intersection of TWY "F" (Foxtrot), with its aircraft lined up over threshold 11L, as was the case.That way, when authorized for takeoff, the PR-GTN pilots did not spot any obstacles that could prevent the start of their run.During the take-off run, after passing the runway slope, the FAB 2345 early viewing by the PR-GTN crew may have been hampered by the following factors:- the lack of stroboscopic lights on the military aircraft may have reduced the possibility to notice the presence of this aircraft on the runway;- the aircraft camouflaged painting may have attenuated the visual contrast, hindering its sighting; and- the red lights of the FAB 2345 collision system could easily be mistaken for the red signal lights at the end of the runway in use.Therefore, the combination of all these conditions may have contributed to the sighting to occur only at the time when the 737 headlights fully lit the military aircraft.In this scenario, where the traffic conflict visualization occurred in marginal conditions, the dexterity of the PR-GTN crew was essential to avoid collision and thus prevent a catastrophe.
A Batik Air Malaysia (former Malindo Air) Boeing 737-900 still in Malindo colours, registration 9M-LNJ performing flight OD-181 from Kathmandu (Nepal) to Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) with 132 passengers and 7 crew, had backtracked runway 20, was cleared for takeoff and commenced takeoff, when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 165 knots over ground). The aircraft came to a stop about 75 meters/250 feet past the end of runway 20 with all gear on soft ground, the crew advised they were off the runway and had rejected takeoff due to a takeoff configuration warning detailing upon further query, they believed a system malfunction had caused the takeoff configuration warning. There were no injuries, the damage to the aircraft is being assessed but believed to be minor.The runway was closed for more than 12 hours until the aircraft could be moved to the apron.Malaysia's Air Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) released their final report concluding the probable causes of the serious incident were:The probable cause of the runway excursion was due to the PIC attempted to reject the take-off at high speed, following take-off Configuration Warning. The rejected TO was initiated at the speed of 154kts, which is above V1. In addition, the maximum braking was not applied throughout the stopping.The AAIB reported the aircraft was accelerating for takeoff from runway 20 when at about V1 the takeoff configuration warning activated. The captain decided to reject takeoff considering the high terrain and bad weather all around Kathmandu. The aircraft however could not stop before the end of the runway and came to a stop about 50 meters past the end of the runway. The crew consulted with Kathmandu Tower, the passengers disembarked via door 2R and the slide there. There were no injuries. Two main tyres deflated, the aircraft did not sustain any other damage. The captain (42, ATPL, 14,349 hours total, 6,473 hours on type) was pilot flying, the first officer (30, ATPL, 3,022 hours total, 2,822 hours on type) was pilot monitoring.The AAIB analysed:According to the flight data the RTO was initiated 4 seconds after V1, at a CAS 154kts. There is no evidence of TO Warning during the take-off roll recorded. The RTO was performed initially with autobrake, and it was disconnected immediately after by applying pressure on the brake pedals by the CPT. Flight data shows a progressive movement of the braking pedals from 30% to close to 90% in 10 seconds. After that point, constant maximum pressure was applied until aircraft came to stop. Runway excursion occurred at Groundspeed 30kts, and the aircraft was stop close to 50m after the RWY02 threshold....Full test performed found nil current faults. Take-off warning reports indicate that speed brake lever was not in down position. Troubleshooting carried out found that speed brake lever switch was out of range and giving an intermittent signal. Adjustment carried out on the switch found satisfactory. Aircraft take-off warning test carried out found satisfactory. EGR carried out found all parameter reads normal....On 7th August 2015 Boeing issued the Technical Bulletin number 737-04-1 R1. This bulletin was issued to address several reports received at Boeing of take-off configuration warnings because the speed brake handle was not in the DOWN detent (not stowed). According to this bulletin, the Boeing 737 Pre-flight procedure and checklist include the step to check the Speed Brake in the DOWN DETENT. Speed brake cable friction and/or speed brake lever spring back force may prevent the handle from dropping completely into the detent by causing the handle to catch securely in the detent. In this bulletin Boeing recommends the technique to ensure the speed brake is properly stowed by pushing down firmly on top of the speed brake handle. Additionally it is mentioned that this technique will not prevent a false warning if the speed brake warning switch is not adjusted correctly, but it should prevent a warning due to the handle not being fully stowed.According to the information gathered during the interviews, the FO check firmly the Speed brake handle at the down detent, and the CPT check it again once the take-off configuration warning sounded, however both actions were not enough to prevent this warning.Additionally, the bulletin emphasises the fact that if the take-off configuration warning occurs during the take-off roll before 80kts, the flight crew should accomplish the Rejected Take Off non-normal manoeuvre as described in the Manoeuvres chapter of the QRH.Metars:VNKT 191820Z 16003KT 6000 -TSRA FEW015 FEW025CB SCT030 BKN100 17/15 Q1014 NOSIG CB TO S SE AND NE=VNKT 191750Z 19004KT 6000 -TSRA FEW015 FEW025CB SCT030 BKN100 17/15 Q1014 NOSIG CB TO S SE AND NE=VNKT 191720Z 00000KT 7000 FEW015 SCT100 18/15 Q1013 NOSIG=VNKT 191650Z 00000KT 7000 FEW015 SCT100 19/13 Q1014 NOSIG=VNKT 191620Z 15004KT 7000 FEW015 SCT100 18/14 Q1014 NOSIG=VNKT 191550Z 00000KT 7000 FEW015 SCT030 18/16 Q1013 NOSIG=VNKT 191520Z 12004KT 7000 FEW015 FEW025CB SCT030 BKN100 19/14 Q1013 NOSIG CB TO NW AND N=VNKT 191450Z 19011KT 6000 -TSRA FEW015 FEW025CB SCT030 BKN100 18/13 Q1013 NOSIG CB TO SW W NW AND NE=VNKT 191420Z 24005KT 6000 TSRA FEW015 FEW025CB SCT030 BKN100 20/17 Q1013 NOSIG CB TO SW W NW AND NE=VNKT 191350Z 23006KT 6000 TSRA FEW015 FEW025CB SCT030 BKN100 21/17 Q1012 NOSIG CB TO SW W NW AND NE=VNKT 191320Z 23008KT 6000 TS FEW020 FEW025CB SCT030 BKN100 22/16 Q1012 NOSIG CB TO SW W NW AND N=The aircraft the following morning:The aircraft seen on the ground, recovery in progress (Photo: Bikash karki):Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):
A CSA Czech Airlines Avions de Transport Regional ATR-72-212A, registration OK-NFU performing flight OK-536 from Prague (Czech Republic) to Frankfurt/Main (Germany), was accelerating for takeoff from Prague's runway 24 when the crew rejected takeoff at 49 KIAS due to the left hand engine not reaching takeoff power. The aircraft returned to the apron.A replacement Airbus A319-100 registration OK-NEM reached Frankfurt with a delay of about 2:10 hours.Czechia's UZPLN reported on Apr 23rd 2020, maintenance identified a left hand Propeller Electronic Control failure and replaced the unit.
A Business Aviation Centre Saab SF-340B on behalf of United Nations, registration UR-ARO performing flight UNO-805 from Lubumbashi to Goma (Democratic Republic of Congo) with 21 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Lubumbashi when the aircraft overran the end of the runway at about 06:05L (04:05Z). No injuries occurred, the aircraft received substantial damage.Ukraine's State Aviation Service reported in their monthly bulletin that the aircraft went beyond the end of the runway during takeoff from Lubumbashi. The aircraft received considerable damage but there were no injuries. The occurrence was rated an accident and is being investigated by the authorities of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ukraine's State Aviation Service have accredited a representative to the investigation.Local sources reported the aircraft was accelerating for takeoff when the right hand propeller separated causing the aircraft to veer right off the runway. Takeoff was rejected, the aircraft came to a stop about 200 meters off the runway center line in rough terrain.No weather data, neither Metars nor local weather station data, are available for the time of the accident.Sweden's Haverikommission released an interim statement in French only by DR Congo's BPEA dated Jan 30th 2014 and reported that following the interim statement the investigation was closed, no final report was published. The interim report states regarding conclusions of the probable causes:At this stage of the investigation we decided on two categories of probable factors: the technical factors:- asymmetric tyre resistance (asymmetric pull resistance) like malfunctions of bearings, brakes- nosewheel steering malfunction causing a deflectionthe human factors:- asymmetric tyre resistance due to inadvertent asymmetric brakingThe preliminary report does not contain any facts, in particular it does not describe what happened, for example, which runway was used for departure, where and what speed the aircraft went off the runway (overran the end, veered left or right off the runway, ...), where the aircraft ended up, what damage it suffered, how many occupants were on the aircraft, and so on.The statement contains a section "discussion", which however is telling the same as the conclusions, as does the "analysis" section. The analysis section permits to conclude however, that both FDR and CVR data were available to the investigation.There is no trace of this investigation on the current BPEA website.
A Spirit Airlines Airbus A321-200, registration N587NK performing flight NK-371 from Fort Lauderdale,FL (USA) to Aguadilla (Puerto Rico), had been cleared for takeoff from Fort Lauderdale's runway 10 and was accelerating for takeoff, when tower cancelled the takeoff clearance due to a vehicle on the runway. The crew rejected takeoff and brought the aircraft to a safe stop.On Jun 2nd 2017 the NTSB reported an airport maintenance truck had been on the runway near taxiway D. The tower controller received an ASDE-X alert warning of the conflict and cancelled the takeoff clearance. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time. The occurrence was rated an incident and is being investigated by the NTSB.The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground for about 6.5 hours before returning to service.On Apr 15th 2020 the NTSB released their final report concluding the probable causes of the incident were:The air traffic controller's failure to ensure the runway surface area was clear of vehicles before clearing an aircraft for takeoff. Also causal was the flight crew's decision to initiate a takeoff while the Runway Status Lights (RWSL) Takeoff Hold Lights (THLs) were activated. Contributing to the incident was the lack of a standard procedure for vehicle operators to request runway clearances and resultant "hear back/read back" error between the vehicle operator and the air traffic controller.The NTSB summarized the sequence of events:The runway incursion occurred during the early morning hours when traffic was light, and when the airport authority usually conducted maintenance activities on the airfield. The air traffic controller approved a request by an airport maintenance vehicle to operate on the runway; however, there were no standard operating procedures or standard phraseology regarding how airfield vehicle operators were to reference the specific runway end when requesting permission to enter a runway. This lack of standard procedure resulted in four hear back/read back errors between the operator of the vehicle and the air traffic controller immediately prior to the runway incursion event.After the airport vehicle had been approved by the air traffic controller to operate on the runway, the crew of the A321 requested a clearance to taxi to the same runway for departure and was subsequently cleared for takeoff. The airport runways and taxiways were equipped with the Runway Status Light (RWSL) system. As the crew of the A321 aligned with the runway centerline for departure, the Takeoff Hold Lights (THL) portion of the RWSL activated, displaying red lights on the runway surface. The crew continued the takeoff over the illuminated RWSL system. The RWSL system was operating correctly and the THL portion of the system deactivated when the A321 reached a predetermined speed consistent with an aircraft continuing departure.As the A321 was departing, the Airport Surface Detection Equipment Model X (ASDE-X) alerted and the air traffic controller responded by cancelling the takeoff clearance when the A321 was near takeoff speed. The A321 stopped on the runway about 500 feet from the airport vehicle.
An Endeavor Canadair CRJ-900 on behalf of Delta Airlines, registration N316PQ performing flight DL-3860 from Detroit,MI to Dallas Ft. Worth,TX (USA), was cleared for takeoff from Detroit's runway 22L and commenced takeoff. About 20 seconds later tower instructed DL-3860 to abort takeoff and instructed a vehicle on the runway to turn right off the runway. The CRJ slowed safely, the closest distance to the vehicle was 211 feet horizontally.On Apr 14th 2020 the NTSB reported there had been two local controllers (LNE and LNW) in charge prior to the occurrence, LNW was controlling runways 22L and 22R. An operations vehicle reported on LNW for a runway inspection of runway 22R and was cleared for the inspection. After the vehicle had finished the inspection the driver advised he was clear of the runway and would now drive to the end of runway 22L for an inspection of runway 22L. LNW cleared the vehicle to hold short of runway 22L at taxiway R. LNW subsequently cleared the vehicle onto runway 22L, the driver drove onto the runway, turned southbound to drive to the very end of the runway, turned around and proceeded now northbound towards the threshold of the runway.About 20 seconds after the vehicle had been cleared onto runway 22L the positions LNE and LNW were merged, LNE took over and received a handover briefing, in which LNW reported the vehicle was on runway 22L moving northbound. During the briefing DL-3860 reported on frequency being ready for departure from runway 22L. The LNE controller later stated in his testimony that he missed the part of the briefing indicating the vehicle on the runway because he focussed on the departure call by the CRJ. LNE issued takeoff clearance from runway 22L to DL-3860. About 20 seconds later ASDE-X alerted the runway was occupied by both DL-3860 and the operations vehicle. After instructing the CRJ to abort takeoff and the vehicle to drive off the runway to the right the LNE controller apologized "that was my fault".The CRJ needed to return to the apron and was able to depart for the flight about 2:20 hours after the rejected takeoff.On Apr 15th 2020 the NTSB released their final report concluding the probable cause of the incident was: "The local controller's failure to visually scan and ensure that the runway surface was not occupied by a vehicle or other aircraft before issuing a takeoff clearance to the pilot. Contributing to this incident was the relieved controller's failure to monitor and review the position, after completing the relief briefing, to ensure that nothing had been overlooked."Metar:KDTW 271253Z 25009KT 10SM -SN SCT025 BKN040 OVC170 M02/M04 A3020RMK AO2 SLP232 P0000 T10171044=ASDE-X Display at the time when the alert activated (Photo: NTSB):ASDE-X Display at the time when tower began transmitting the instruction to abort takeoff (Photo: NTSB):
A Starbow Airlines Avions de Transport Regional ATR-72-212A, registration 9G-SBF performing flight S9-104 from Accra to Kumasi (Ghana) with 63 passengers and 5 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Accra's runway 21 at 12:20L (12:20Z) when the aircraft veered left off the runway and entangled with the perimeter fence. One passenger received serious, four passengers received minor injuries, the aircraft sustained substantial damage.The airport reported flight S9-104 from Accra's Kokota Airport to Kumasi carrying 63 passengers and 5 crew skidded off the runway during takeoff. One passenger received minor injuries and was taken to a hospital.On Nov 26th 2017 the airline reported the aircraft carrying 63 passengers and 5 crew skidded off the runway. Five occupants including Ghana's Deputy Minister of Energy sustained minor injuries. The airline suspended all operations with immediate effect.First investigation results suggest the aircraft skidded off the runway and impacted a fence wall after an engine (PW127) shut suddenly down.On Nov 30th 2017 Ghana's Civil Aviation Authority reported the aircraft was accelerating for takeoff from Accra when at about 70 KIAS the captain's seat moved fully backwards violently and shifted to the left. As the captain was still controlling nose wheel steering via the steering tiller, this caused the aircraft to veer left and off the runway. The captain did not regain control of the aircraft prior of it coming to a stop close to the perimeter fence following efforts by the first officer to retard the power levers. The crew secured the aircraft, the passengers disembarked. There were five injuries. The occurrence was rated an accident, an investigation is underway.The occurrence aircraft had joined Starbow's fleet only on Nov 22nd 2017.Although the document is marked "confidential", Ghana's Ministry of Aviation published their Accident Investigation Board'ss (AIB) final report concluding the probable causes of the accident were:Contributory FactorsFactors that contributed to the accident include the following;- The rain storm that affected the airfield during the takeoff.- Loss of situational awareness in the takeoff process.- Inadvertent movement of the captains seat.- Improper procedure in aborting the takeoff.- Poor crew resource management.Causal FactorsIt is the opinion of the committee that the causal factors which led to the accident include; - Loss of situational awareness on the part of the cockpit crew, leading to runway excursion. - Failure by the crew to execute correct procedure in aborting the takeoff.The AIB assigned by the Ministry reported one passenger received serious injuries requiring surgery, four passengers received minor injuries. The aircraft sustained substantial damage, when it veered left of runway 21 during the takeoff run. In addition, the aircraft ran over the inner PAPI light and destroyed it, 30 meters of the airport's inner perimeter fence were also damaged.The captain (36, ATPL, 6,500 hours total, 5,400 hours on type) was pilot flying, the first officer (39, ATPL, 2,700 hours total, 1,450 hours on type) was pilot monitoring. The AIB annotated: "Currently, the captain holds the positions of Director of Flight Operations, Chief Pilot and Training Captain. The FO was previously employed by FLY 540 as a FO on the ATR 72. His last flight with FLY 540 was in January 2014. He flew the Piper Seminole in March 2014 to obtain his ATPL and did not fly again until he was employed by Aero Surveys Ltd in July of 2017. The accident occurred during his first day on the job as a FO having flown only one hour twelve minutes the morning before the leg that resulted in the accident."The AIB stated: The aircraft had just come out of a 4-year major check and was airworthy prior to the flight. It had one outstanding Airworthiness Directive (AD) which was due on 30 December 2018 affecting both pilot and co-pilot seats. The AD was issued by EASA on 16 December 2016 to address the inadvertent movement of the cockpit seat. The AD was effective on 30 December 2016 and due on 30 December 2018. During the 4-year check, a works order was raised during the check for the implementation of the AD but it was not carried out Prior to the AD.ATR had previously issued two AOMs on 2 April 2014 and 27 July 2016 advising operators on how to address the inadvertent seat movement, pending the final fix of the defect. A third AOM was also issued on 19 December 2016 on the same subject. The three AOMs were based on the SBs issued by the seat manufacture, IPECO. ... ATR OEB is requesting the flight crew to ensure their seat is locked properly. In fact, even without AD embodied, as soon as the seat is locked, it will not move. The Purpose of the AD is to limit the backward travel movement due to improper seat locking.The weight and balance sheet for the flight was checked and found to be okay.With respect to the history of the operator and aircraft the AIB stated:Aero Survey Limited was certified in 2007 to perform domestic air shuttle services. They operated two Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante. In 2011, the airline changed ownership and modified its operations to include domestic scheduled flights with the brand name Starbow. It began operations on 26 September 2011 providing domestic transport services with the BAE 146  300 aircraft.In June 2015 Starbow supplemented its operations with a wet leased ATR 72 aircraft operated by SwiftAir S.A. In December 2017 the company ceased operating the BAE 146  300 and deregistered the last aircraft on 13 December 2017. Starbow entered into an agreement with NAC Aviation, Ireland, to dry lease two ATR 72  212A. The first aircraft, 9G-SBF was received on 22 November 2017 and the second was to arrive at a later date.The AIB analysed:The weather was VFR, however conditions changed rapidly to IMC due to heavy rain. No weather warning was issued by ATC.IKM 104 was cleared for taxi via A and A2 to backtrack on the displaced threshold to make way for Emirates to exit the runway at A1 which the crew complied.The crew were not heard performing any checks except, gustlock before takeoff.At about 63 knots, a sound is heard on the CVR indicative of a seat movement which is consistent with the captains report that his seat moved backwards inadvertently to the aft stop position and failed to lock. The captain handed over controls to the co-pilot which was acknowledged.Crew was not aware that the aircraft was going off the runway during the takeoff until the aircraft was almost at the edge of the runway. At this point the storm had hit the airfield, it had started raining heavily and the windshield wipers were operating at maximum speed.On realising that the aircraft was going off the runway, the crew initiated action to abort the takeoff by bringing the power levers to ground idle and tried to maintain directional control with the rudder. However, reverse thrust was not selected.The aircraft reached 94 knots before decelerating gradually and thereafter impacted the inner perimeter fence with both engines running.The takeoff run was initiated just as the airport was being engulfed in thundery rain.The wind information from ATC was 100° at 17knots.The crew was in a hurry to takeoff ahead of the incoming storm.The captain handed over controls to the co-pilot after the inadvertent movement of his seat, which appeared to have occurred around 63 knots. The same crew had experienced a similar inadvertent seat movement on their morning flight from Kumasi to Accra in which the captain handed over control to the co-pilot and the co-pilot continued the takeoff without any incident.On this Flight IKM 104, at the time the captain handed over controls to the co-pilot, the aircraft was left off centreline and heading approximately 6° off.The entire takeoff run up to the point of runway exit was done on one half of the runway.The crew appeared to have lost situational awareness during the takeoff run.Before initiating the takeoff, the crew should have anticipated the effect of the rain and winds from the storm and their priority should have been to ensure that the aircraft was properly aligned on the centreline and taken the necessary corrective measures to ensure that the aircraft remained on the centreline during the roll.There was poor crew resource management in the entire flight. The captain performed most of the activities in the cockpit and the crew did not follow the company SOPs. For instance;a. Radio communications with ATC was handled solely by the captain.b. The taxi was done by the captain and followed the track shown in figure 14. The aircraft barely stayed on the centre line throughout the taxi.c. No reading of checklist or pre-departure brief was heard prior to the take off.d. Aircraft positioned for takeoff on the left side of runway centreline.e. No call outs were heard during the takeoff run.In addition to normal braking, selection of emergency brakes and use of reverse thrust could have decelerated the aircraft faster and prevented the collision of the aircraft with the inner perimeter fence.The captains seat inadvertently moved during the takeoff because it was not properly locked. It was the captains responsibility to ensure that his seat was properly locked prior to take off as recommended by ATR in its AOMs. Starbow should have incorporated the recommendations in theAOMs into their SOPs and ensured compliance by their pilots.During the 4-year check, a job card was raised for the implementation of EASA AD No 2016-0256 in respect of the captain and co-pilots seats. However, the work was deferred and the status remained open with due date 30 December 2018. The AD highlighted the need to secure and lock the seat in its required position. Even though the due date of the AD was 30 December 2018, given that this was a new aircraft type inclusion, the operator had the opportunity for the modification to be implemented prior to taking delivery of the aircraft from NAC.The GCAA certification team became aware of the non-implementation of the AD during their inspection. Since this was a new aircraft type inclusion the CAA should have advised the operator to take the opportunity to implement the AD prior to the issuance of the certificate of airworthiness.An initial examination of the seats after the accident revealed the following;a. A broken spring on the right horizontal track locks system of the captains seat.b. Both alignment washers (packers) were not in place on the captains seat.In the case of the co-pilots seat, all springs and washers were intact. Also, while all other springs looked black (refer to figure 19), that on the captains seat looked ash in colour (refer to figure 18), an indication that the broken spring may have been replaced during maintenance.Further examination and rotational test on the seat by IPECO revealed the following;a. Roll back of the seat is impossible when the pins are correctly locked into the rails. Thus the seat was unlocked during take-off roll.b. A substantial rotational play is present on this seat. This play seems to be the cause of the difficulties of stopping a roll back from an unlocked position.c. The cause of the rotational play could not be identified.d. The failure of the right spring may have contributed to the fact that the roll back was not stopped during take-off roll.e. The incorrect fitting assembly of the spring (missing washers) may have contributed to the failure of the right spring. The Duty Air Traffic Controller activated emergency rescue actions. Three fire trucks were dispatched to the scene from the RFFS plus another fire truck from the Air Force Base. The RFFS arrived at the scene after four minutes. An ambulance and a pickup vehicle were also dispatched by the RFFS to the scene. Another ambulance from the Airport Clinic with a medical team was dispatched to the scene. Efforts were made to rescue passengers in the rain using the fire tender.Passengers disembarked through the rear service door with the assistance of the RFFS who provided a ladder. The disembarkation and movement of passengers to the holding area at the RFFS lasted over 40 minutes. Passengers should have been evacuated quickly out of the aircraft instead of holding them in the aircraft and disembarking them as and when vehicles became available.The operator failed to provide transport and other services to the passengers at the accident scene and thereafter. The operator appeared unfamiliar with their responsibilities in respect of post-accident passenger handling.Vehicular movement to and from the accident scene was extremely difficult due to the soggy nature of the terrain. A fire tender got stuck at some point during the evacuation.Preliminary investigation of aircraft accidents in Ghana, handled by the GCAA, is on an adhoc basis under the direction of the Director Safety Regulations and the GCAA accident investigations Coordinator. There was no toxicology test and no post-accident physical medical examination was conducted on the crew because this was not requested by the preliminary investigation team (PIT). The PIT did not provide a list of possible witnesses and their contact details. This caused delays in locating witnesses to appear before the committee. GCAA should develop adequate procedure for handling preliminary investigations.Metars:DGAA 251400Z 28005KT 240V300 9999 FEW020 FEW030CB 25/20 Q1011 NOSIG=DGAA 251300Z 22012KT 1300 TSRA OVC013 FEW030CB 23/22 Q1012 NOSIG=DGAA 251200Z 27007KT 230V300 9999 FEW028 30/23 Q1012 NOSIG=DGAA 251100Z 26008KT 230V290 9999 FEW024 SCT028 30/24 Q1013 NOSIG=DGAA 251000Z 27009KT 240V300 9999 FEW020 29/24 Q1013 NOSIGThe broken spring at the captain's seat with missing washers (Photo: AIB):The aircraft entangled with the perimeter fence:Details of damage:Map (Graphics: AIB/BEA):
A Delta Airlines Boeing 737-900, registration N867DN performing flight DL-2049 from San Francisco,CA to Atlanta,GA (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from San Francisco's runway 01R when the right hand engine ingested two geese prompting the crew to reject takeoff at high speed (above 100 knots over ground). The aircraft slowed, vacated the runway about 7100 feet/2150s meter down the runway and returned to the apron. Tower initiated a runway inspection.The flight was cancelled.The FAA reported the #2 engine ingested at least two geese on departure roll and rated the occurrence an incident with unknown damage.
An Indigo Airbus A320-200N, registration VT-IVO performing flight 6E-291 from Guwahati to Kolkata (India), was accelerating for takeoff from Guwahati when the left hand engine (PW1127G) suffered an engine stall associated with high vibrations prompting the crew to reject takeoff. The aircraft slowed safely.India's DGCA reported on Mar 31st 2020, that the occurrence had been rated a serious incident, an investigation has been opened. A post flight inspection revealed damaged blades of the left hand engine's low pressure turbine stage 3.
A Martin Air Boeing 747-400 freighter, registration PH-CKA performing freight flight MP-7341 from Amsterdam (Netherlands) to Sao Paulo Viracopos,SP (Brazil) with 3 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Amsterdam's runway 36L when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 118 knots over ground) after they heard a loud bang from the cargo area. The aircraft slowed and stopped, emergency services were called to check the brakes indicating hot. The crew advised they were very heavy at about 410 tons, all their brakes were very warm. The left hand brakes began to cool some time later. The crew shut down all but the #1 engine (CF6, left outboard). Some time later the right hand brake temperatures also stopped to rise just before becoming critical (tyre deflation) and began to cool as well. The crew advised they had been at the limit for losing all tyres. A tow truck was dispatched, the crew shut the #1 engine down too and the aircraft was towed to the apron.The aircraft remained on the ground for about 3 hours, then departed for the flight.Emergency Services were told by tower, the crew had advised they rejected takeoff due to a bang from the cargo hold caused by some "omgevallen koffers" (toppled suitcases).
A MIAT Mongolian Airlines Boeing 737-800, registration EI-CXV performing flight OM-7056 from Khovd to Ulaanbaatar (Mongolia) with 100 passengers and 11 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Khovd when the aircraft went over soft ground creating a huge cloud of dust. The crew rejected takeoff at low speed and stopped the aircraft. There were no injuries, the aircraft received damage.The aircraft is still on the ground in Khovd a week later.The airline reported the crew lost directional control at about 60 knots and rejected takeoff. The flight was cancelled due to the necessary maintenance, the passengers were rebooked onto the next two Aeromongolia flights the following morning. An investigation has been opened into the occurrence.Passengers reported the aircraft was accelerating when it entered a dirt track raising a huge cloud of dust so that they could not see anything outside of the aircraft anymore. Ground observers reported the aircraft was accelerating for takeoff from Khovd when the aircraft disappeared in a huge cloud of dust. Khovd Airport, located 610nm west of Ulaanbaatar, features a runway 16/34 of 2850 meters/9350 feet length.Mongolia's AAIB released their final report in Mongolian only (Editorial note: to serve the purpose of global prevention of the repeat of causes leading to an occurrence an additional timely release of all occurrence reports in the only world spanning aviation language English would be necessary, a Mongolian only release does not achieve this purpose as set by ICAO annex 13 and just forces many aviators to waste much more time and effort each in trying to understand the circumstances leading to the occurrence. Aviators operating internationally are required to read/speak English besides their local language, investigators need to be able to read/write/speak English to communicate with their counterparts all around the globe).The AAIB concludes the probable cause was:The aircraft went off runway 34 when the crew stepped into the left rudder pedal causing the aircraft to turn left. Nose wheel steering and wheel brakes were not used to prevent the aircraft from going off the runway.Contributing factors were:- Lack of company policy in the flight operations manual with respect to cross wind takeoffs- Substantial lateral forces due to windy conditions at an aerodrome in high mountaineous terrain- Realistic wind speed and wind direction indications could not be reported because the automatic wind observation system at the threshold runway 34 was not installed- Low aircraft weight with aft CG- Slope of runway 34 is 1.6%- The flight crew rejected takeoff however did not follow the appropriate procedures- Takeoff in intermittent winds with insufficient training and experienceThe engine damage was caused by:- Aircraft out of runway and out of direction- Reversers not used to suit the situation- A runway safety strip is required but was not available due to lack of complianceThe captain (47, ATPL, 9,442 hours total, hours on type could not be determined from the logbooks) was pilot flying, the first officer (48, CPL, total hours and hours on type not determined, logbook was not presented) was pilot monitoring. The investigation attempted to determine the experience of the first officer based on alternative methods and assumes an experience of 4,800 hours on type.The crew had backtracked runway 34, lined the aircraft up runway 34 for departure in a right hand turn and performed a rolling takeoff. Ailerons are deflected to the left into the wind, elevator input is neutral, the rudder pedal is deflected to the right to compensate for crosswind, the aircraft accelerates along the runway center line. At about 60 knots the right hand rudder pressure is released followed by a left rudder input, the aircraft turns to the left about 440 meters down the runway, 610 meters down the runway the left main gear, 650 meters down the runway the nose gear and 675 meters down the runway the right main gear departed the left runway edge onto soft ground, until then there is no evidence of any braking on runway or FDR, the right main gear collided with a runway edge light and destroyed it, a large right rudder input occurred, the takeoff was rejected, the thrust reversers temporarily opened, the aircraft turned right, returned onto the runway surface with the right main gear 784 meters down the runway, nose gear 806 meters and left main gear 820 meters down the runway, the aircraft now drifts to the right edge of the runway, 963 meters down the runway the right main gear departs the paved surface to the right, a large left rudder input occurred and the right main gear returns onto the runway 1028 meters down the runway. The aircraft stopped 1080 meters down the runway.The AAID analysed that the takeoff mass was 64,395 kg according to the loadsheet, the CG was at 25% MAC, within permitted limits for takeoff. The stabilizer setting at at 4.7 units, 0.2 units off the correct setting. According to the load sheet the nose wheel would have carry a mass of 4,186kg with the maingear supporting 60,209kg. A Boeing simulation of the occurrence determined however, that the CG was at 29% MAC (within limits), the nose wheel carried a load of only 3,542kg with the main gear supporting 60,853kg. According to the Boeing flight operations manual a forward CG should be achieved for operations in strong winds, a mass between 5,000 and 7,000kg on the nose wheel is recommended.Wind Data (Graphics: AAID):Runway tracks at begin of excursion (Photo: AAID):Runway tracks left of the runway egde (Photo: AAID):Runway tracks right of the runway egde (Photo: AAID):Engine fan blades after the excursion (Photo: AAID):
A Silverstone Air Services Fokker 50, registration 5Y-IZO performing flight K5-620 from Nairobi Wilson to Mombasa (Kenya) with 50 passengers and 5 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Wilson Airport's runway 14 at about 09:00L but overran the end of the runway and came to a stop in a ditch entangled with bushes about 270 meters past the runway end. Three passengers received serious injuries, the aircraft received substantial damage.Kenya's Airport Authority reported two passengers received minor injuries, when the aircraft with 50 passengers and 5 crew departing for Lamu via Mombasa went off the runway during departure. The airline confirmed an incident at Wilson Airport and stated, passengers and crew disembarked safely. A passenger reported they were just about to take off at high speed when the crew noticed some issue and rejected takeoff.On Oct 12th 2019 one of the injured passengers is still in stationary hospital care with a left arm injury, the doctors decribe her condition as stable, she is out of danger.On Mar 24th 2020 the Onderzoeksraad (Dutch Safety Board DSB) reported in their quarterly bulletin for Q4 2019, that three passengers received serious injuries when the aircraft went past the end of the runway and received substantial damage. Kenya's AAID is investigating the accident.Metars:HKNW 110800Z 07008KT 9999 BKN022 20/15 Q1021=HKNW 110700Z 06014KT 9999 BKN021 19/16 Q1022=HKNW 110600Z 09012KT 9999 BKN020 18/16 Q1022=HKNW 110500Z 07008KT 9999 OVC018 17/16 Q1021=HKNW 110400Z 07010KT 9999 OVC018 16/16 Q1020=The aircraft in the ditch (Photo: japheth masanda):Aerial overview (Photos: Kenya Aviator):Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):
An Antonov Design Bureau Antonov AN-124-100, registration UR-82072 performing flight ADB-5250 from Ostend (Belgium) to Mazar-i-Sharif (Afghanistan), was accelerating for takeoff from Ostend's runway 26 at about 19:05L (18:05Z) when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 110 knots over ground) due to a poblem with the #2 engine (D-18T, inboard left hand). The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.On Nov 29th 2019 Antonov Design Bureau told The Aviation Herald: "Because of the surge of the second engine of the AN124-100-150, the decision to the take off was aborted. The aircraft was inspected by Antonov technical specialists and no damage was found. The engine has been sent to the manufacturer for further investigation, and in order to ensure that our obligations to the customer are fulfilled, another aircraft was sent to Ostend."Ukraine's NBAAI reported in their November 2019 Bulletin that the #2 engine failed at about 110 KIAS during the takeoff run from runway 26. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron. Debris was collected from the runway. Belgium's AIB is investigating the occurrence.On Mar 11th 2020 the State Aviation Administration of Ukraine released their Airworthiness Directive AD-0890-20 stating that an uncontained engine failure had occurred. The source of the failure had been the destruction of the 2nd stage disk rim of the intermediate pressure compressor. The AD requires:Within a period of 6 months or until an engine time in service will be 250+50 hours (whichever comes first) after effective date of this AD, conduct one-time eddy current inspection of the 2nd stage disk dovetails of the intermediate pressure compressor in accordance with the instructions of the "Service Bulletin for Inspection No. ISB 18T-72.30-137" of SE "Ivchenko-Progress".The results of AD implementation shall be sent to the engine manufacturer JSC MOTOR SICH and the TC holder SE Ivchenko-Progress within 3 working days.In case if any cracks are detected in the area of 2nd stage disk ovetails of the intermediate pressure compressor the engine shall be removed from aircraft and corrective actions in accordance with the instructions of SE Ivchenko-Progress shall be performed.Metars:EBOS 261950Z 17011KT 9999 FEW015 11/09 Q0996 NOSIG=EBOS 261920Z 17011KT 9999 FEW020 11/09 Q0996 NOSIG=EBOS 261850Z 18011KT 9999 FEW018 SCT025 BKN040 11/09 Q0996 NOSIG=EBOS 261820Z 17013KT 9999 FEW018 11/09 Q0996 NOSIG=EBOS 261750Z 17012KT 9999 FEW018 SCT038 11/09 Q0996 NOSIG=EBOS 261720Z 17011KT 9999 FEW018 SCT048 11/09 Q0997 NOSIG=EBOS 261650Z 17011KT 9999 FEW018 BKN048 11/09 Q0997 NOSIG=EBOS 261620Z 18011KT 9999 FEW018 SCT045 11/09 Q0997 NOSIG=EBOS 261550Z 18013KT 9999 FEW014 SCT020 11/09 Q0997 NOSIG=EBOS 261520Z 18011KT 9999 FEW014 SCT040 11/10 Q0997 NOSIG=
A MyCargo Airlines Boeing 747-400 freighter on behalf of Saudia Cargo Airlines, registration TC-ACR performing freight flight SV-916 from Maastricht (Netherlands) to Jeddah (Saudi Arabia) with 4 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Maastricht's runway 21 at 23:37L (22:37Z) when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed and deployed the thrust reversers. The aircraft veered right off the runway and came to a stop with all gear on soft ground to the right of the runway about 180 meters past the displaced runway threshold and about 360 meters after the begin of takeoff run (about abeam the first touch down zone markers runway 21). There were no injuries.Saudia Cargo's parent Company Saudi Arabian Airlines reported the aircraft suffered an engine problem causing the runway excursion while attempting to takeoff. There were no injuries and no damage.The Dutch DSB reported they opened an investigation into the runway excursion of a cargo aircraft at Maastricht Airport.On Nov 16th 2017 the DSB reported that the aircraft of ACT Airlines was accelerating for takeoff when the aircraft suddenly pulled to the right, the crew could not correct, the aircraft exited the runway and came to a stop in the grass. The 4 crew remained uninjured, the aircraft sustained damage. The cargo and fuel were unloaded, then the aircraft was recovered and moved back onto paved surface. The investigation is ongoing with the assistance from Turkish, American and British accident investigation authorities.The aircraft is still on the ground in Maastricht as of Feb 2nd 2018, a tent has been built around the aircraft to conduct the needed aircraft repairs, which suggests that other than initial information of no damage suggested, the aircraft sustained substantial damage (editorial note: which is why we changed the occurrence rating to Accident on Feb 2nd 2018).ACT Airlines were renamed to MyCargo Airlines in 2011.On Mar 16th 2020 the DSB released their final report concluding the probable cause of the accident was:The runway excursion was caused by the pilots inability to maintain directional control under the conditions of prolonged asymmetric thrust that resulted from the loss of thrust on engine #4 at low speed. The loss of engine thrust was caused by a compressor stall.Contributing factors The thrust levers were not retarded immediately after the loss of thrust. Such delays and not following trained procedures have been associated with the phenomenon known as the startle effect.During training courses in flight simulators, the lessons learned from unexpected situations, such as engine failures, are quite limited as the crews know what to expect.The DSB summarized the sequence of events:After the aircraft was loaded, the captain, who was pilot flying, taxied to Runway 21 and initiated a rolling take-off. He advanced the thrust levers and, when the engines had stabilised, he pushed the TO/GA switches, causing the engines to accelerate to the selected take-off thrust. The aircraft had accelerated to approximately 30 knots when the outboard engine on the right side (engine #4) suddenly lost power. The aircraft veered to the right due to the resultant asymmetric thrust. The thrust levers were not immediately retarded to idle, so this asymmetric thrust continued. Attempts to steer the aircraft back to the centreline by means of nose wheel steering and differential braking, were unsuccessful. The aircraft could not be controlled. It veered off the runway and continued on into the soft ground on the right-hand side of the runway. The resistance of the soft ground and the eventual retardation of the thrust levers caused the aircraft to come to a standstill. None of the crew was injured. The aircraft sustained substantial damage.The captain (63, ATPL, 18,550 hours total, 3,030 hours on type) was pilot flying, the first officer (42, ATPL, 4,462 hours total, 2,042 hours on type) was pilot monitoring.The DSB analysed:The crew received take-off clearance while approaching Runway 21. This enabled them to commence a rolling take-off, maintaining a ground speed of approximately 5 kts during the right turn to line up on the runway. At 22.36:34 hours, the captain advanced the thrust levers to approximately 70%. As thrust increased to the selected take-off power, a minor difference developed between engine #4 and the remaining engines. As a result, some pedal steering inputs were required to keep the aircraft aligned with the runway centreline. At this time, engine #4 (and, to a lesser extent, engine #3) was producing noticeably more thrust than the other engines. The steering inputs were to the right, as the difference in thrust was causing the aircraft to veer to the left.When the engines had stabilised at 70% N1 the captain pressed the TO/GA switches, thus engaging the autothrottle. The captains call-outs and actions, and those of the first officer, were all in accordance with the SOPs. However, the first officers saying Set thrust, followed by the captains Take off are not mentioned in SOPs or checklists. No explanation could be given for these calls. The whole sequence of the crews actions was in keeping with a routine flight, involving nothing out of the ordinary.During the start of the take-off roll, the tasks were divided up as prescribed in the manuals; the captain was looking outside and keeping the aircraft in the middle of the runway, while the first officer monitored the instruments. Four seconds after the autothrottle was engaged, at a ground speed of 30 kts, a loud bang was heard and the N1 of engine #4 dropped to around 20%. In his interview, the captain stated that he did not hear the bang because he was the only one who was wearing an active noise cancelling headset over both ears and because the noise originated from the right side of the aircraft. The first officer had only one of his ears covered by his headset, while neither the technician nor the load master were wearing headsets. The fact that only these three individuals heard the bang confirms the assumption that the captain did not hear the noise because it was muted by his headset.Unable to hear the loud bang, the captain could not understand why the aircraft was suddenly yawing to the right-hand side of the runway. This triggered the normal response of trying to counteract this yaw by steering to the left, by means of nose wheel rudder pedal steering. As the captain was still applying the right rudder pedal, it took some time before he could switch to the left rudder pedal once the right yawing occurred. The captain also stated that he used the nose wheel steering tiller to steer the aircraft to the left. The DSB analysed the control inputs:As he aligned the aircraft with the runway centreline, the captain increased thrust to perform a rolling take-off. Thrust is set using the right hand, so the captains right hand was holding the thrust levers. At that time, he was operating the tiller with his left hand.This suggests that he was not holding the control column. This was confirmed by FDR data, which showed that zero force was being exerted on the captains control column at that point. The thrust difference between the engines during spin-up was such that the N1 of engine #4 was higher than the N1 of the other three engines. This resulted in a yaw to the left. As a result, the captain had to make corrections with the rudder pedals, steering to the right during the initial phase of the take-off.The captain then felt the aircraft yaw suddenly to the right. Unaware of the cause, he tried to arrest this movement by using nose wheel steering inputs. As stated, he used both pedal and tiller nose wheel steering. However, tiller inputs override rudder pedal inputs.When it became clear that nose wheel steering was not sufficient, he applied brake pressure. This occurred three seconds after the beginning of the event, as shown by an increase in the main gear brake torques. FDR data showed that, initially, both the righthand and left-hand main gear brakes were engaged. Shortly thereafter, braking of the right-hand gear decreased, which is indicative of differential braking. Although the aircraft had initially been heading a little to the left, it subsequently experienced an increasing deviation to the right. As take-off power was still engaged, the combined effect of tiller nose wheel steering and differential braking was insufficient to counteract the yaw to the right.According to FDR data a control wheel input (steering to the left) was recorded shortly after the engine failure occurred. Thus, while the captain was holding the tiller with his left hand, he had most probably moved his right hand from the thrust levers to the control wheel. The captain was of the opinion that he had retarded the thrust levers almost immediately after noticing the deviation. However both FDR data and CVR data showed that the thrust levers were retarded to idle approximately eight seconds after the N1 drop of engine #4. This means that asymmetric thrust was acting on the aircraft for eight seconds.The captain stated that he had tried to steer the aircraft to the left, using the tiller to keep the aircraft on the runway, while the first officer stated that he did not operate any controls. Thus, it was concluded that the captains left hand remained on the tiller until the aircraft had come to a full stop at its final resting place.The DSB analysed the Rejected Takeoff Procedure:During the take-off procedure, the first officers task is to monitor the engine instruments, call out any abnormal indications, and adjust take-off thrust as necessary until the aircraft reaches a speed of 80 kts. Initially, all engine instrument readings were normal. Thus his attention was focused on the air speed indicator, as he was required to call out the speed when the aircraft reached 80 kts. Immediately after the aircraft yawed to the right, the first evidence that an anomaly had occurred was the loud bang that he heard. No caution or warning was audible or visible on the EICAS, but the combination of the bang and the yaw indicated to him that the situation was very serious. That was probably why  almost immediately after these events  he called off, abort, abort, abort, in an effort to get the captain to abort the take-off. The interval between the bang and his abort call was a little more than one second. Partly because there was no caution or warning, he did not notice the drop in engine #4s N1. As a consequence, he did not call out engine failure as a reason for rejecting the take-off (the procedure specified in the manuals). Because the first officer did not announce the reason for the RTO, the captain did not know what had prompted the first officers abort call.Despite the call to abort the take-off, the captain initially tried to keep the aircraft on the runway by a combination of steering and braking. The thrust levers were retarded to forward idle about eight seconds after the N1 of engine #4 dropped, and around six seconds after the first officer's call to abort. The selection of reverse thrust resulted in automatic disconnection of the autothrottle and extension of the speed brakes. At that point, the aircraft had already veered off the runway to the right and had rolled onto the grass. The thrust levers were not closed immediately, so they were still at the take-off power setting when the aircraft veered off the runway and rolled onto the soft ground.By the time the thrust levers were moved to forward idle, the speed of the aircraft had already dropped almost to zero, due to the combined effects of the applied brakes and of the drag created by the soft ground.Information obtained from the FDR, the CVR and the pilot interviews showed that the standard rejected take-off procedure had not been followed. Although the first officer was aware of the need to reject the take-off, the captains actions were consistent with an attempt to keep the aircraft on the runway by means of rudder pedal, braking, control column and tiller inputs. It can be concluded that, during the event, the captain had been using his left hand to operate the tiller and that he had moved his right hand from the throttles to the control wheel. This means that the captain was no longer holding the throttles, in contravention of the take-off procedure.As the throttles were not retarded, a runway excursion became inevitable. This is because, if there is an outboard engine failure at low speed, while the remaining engines are at take-off thrust, it is impossible to keep the aircraft on the runway.The DSB analysed they were able to rule out foreign object damage or weather conditions causing the engine compressor stall.The DSB analysed that noise cancelling head sets as used by the captain cause concern because "the pilot may be unaware of environmental sounds and audible warning annunciations in the cockpit that do not come through the intercom system. Noise cancelling headsets are most effective over a narrow frequency range, but the specific frequencies may vary by make and model. Therefore, it is difficult to assess any effects the headsets may have on discerning environmental sounds ..."The DSB analysed the "startle effect":This investigation revealed that the flight crew's actions corresponded to some symptoms of the startle effect, as described above. In the interval until the aircraft had come to a complete stop, no mention was made of engine failure and the captains RTO actions were not monitored, nor was there any communication between the members of the flight crew. Such actions are consistent with the impact of a startle event. Someone asked what happened? after the aircraft had stopped, indicating that their actions were prompted by surprise.Metars:EHBK 120025Z AUTO 23005KT 3100 BR FEW003 04/04 Q1010=EHBK 112355Z AUTO 21005KT 1700 BR BKN002 OVC044 05/05 Q1010=EHBK 112325Z AUTO 21005KT 2300 BR BKN032 OVC037 05/05 Q1010 REDZ=EHBK 112255Z AUTO 22004KT 200V260 3600 -DZ FEW029 SCT033 OVC038 05/05 Q1010=EHBK 112225Z AUTO 25003KT 210V300 8000 BKN040 OVC044 05/05 Q1011=EHBK 112155Z AUTO 26004KT 230V310 7000 NSC 05/05 Q1010 TEMPO 4000 BR=EHBK 112125Z AUTO 25005KT 220V300 8000 NSC 05/05 Q1010 TEMPO 4000 BR=EHBK 112055Z AUTO 24004KT 210V280 3200 BR NSC 05/05 Q1010 TEMPO 2500=EHBK 112025Z AUTO 23005KT 2500 BR FEW002 05/05 Q1010 TEMPO 1400 BKN003=EHBK 111955Z AUTO 23005KT 1100 R21/1800D BR OVC000/// 06/05 Q1010 TEMPO 1800 BKN003=Aerial overview after the runway excursion (Photo: DSB/Aviation Police):Repair works in progress March 2018:The aircraft seen on Feb 2nd 2018 (Photo: SOAR):The aircraft seen from tower (Photo: EHBK ATC):The aircraft off the runway (Photo: Jeroen Stroes):The aircraft off the runway (Photo: Jan Severijns):Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth): 
An Air Transat Airbus A321-200, registration C-GEZO performing flight TS-783 from Fort Lauderdale,FL (USA) to Quebec City,QB (Canada) with 185 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Fort Lauderdale's runway 28L when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 15 knots over ground) due to losing directional control. The crew declared Mayday but advised they did not need assistance. The crew subsequently advised they had an issue with the nose wheels and requested an inspection of the landing gear. Airport operations were called by tower to perform a runway inspection and check the nose gear of the aircraft. The crew explained their nose wheels were way off, the crew cancelled Mayday.The Canadian TSB reported: "During take-off roll at approximately 15 kts, Flight crew rejected take off due to loss of directional control. The aircraft was brought to a full stop and flight crew declared a MAYDAY. After assessment of the situation and inspection, flight crew taxied the aircraft to the ramp."The aircraft remained on the ground for about 80 minutes, then departed and reached Quebec with a delay of about 90 minutes.
A Swiss International Airlines Bombardier C-Series CS-300 (also now known as Airbus A220), registration HB-JCC performing flight LX-2077 from Porto (Portugal) to Geneva (Switzerland) with 41 passengers and 5 crew, was accelerating for takeoff just prior to rotation when the crew received a configuration warning regarding the spoilers. The crew continued takeoff and the flight for a safe landing in Geneva about 2:05 hours later.Switzerland's SUST reported the occurrence was rated a serious incident, the SUST have opened an investigation.On Mar 11th 2020 the SUST released their final report concluding the probable cause of the serious incident was:The serious incident, in which a commercial aircraft took off with insufficient engine power, can be attributed to the fact that the flight crew was too late to notice that the engine power required for takeoff was not set. The following factors contributed to the serious incident:- Non-compliance with the aviation company's standard operating procedures (SOP);- Inappropriate prioritisation by the flight crew during the takeoff roll.Although they did not influence the development and course of the serious incident, the following risk factors were identified during the investigation:- The design of the spoiler deployment;- The design of the autothrottle (AT), whereby the AT switches to HOLD mode during the takeoff roll, even if the required takeoff power (target N1) has not yet been reached.The crew decided for a takeoff with flaps in position and a derated take off thrust corresponding to the maximum possible thrust reduction. The crew thus computed V1=117 KIAS, Vr=122 KIAS and V2=129 KIAS. Engine thrust was calculated to 80.7% N1. The Accelerate-Stop Distance was computed at 1746 meters.The SUST described the sequence of events:At 01:59:36 UTC, the flight crew received clearance to line up and take off. When lining up, the commander (CMD) armed the autothrottle (AT). The flight crew performed a rolling takeoff. Aligned to the runway, the CMD advanced the throttles at 02:00:31 UTC, assuming that the AT would then set the takeoff thrust required to an N1 of 80.7 % (see chapter 1.6.3.2). The data shows that the throttle lever angle (TLA) was 20.6¡ã after the throttles had been advanced. For AT activation, the TLA would have needed to be more than 23¡ã; the AT therefore remained armed without being engaged. This went unnoticed by the flight crew.The data also shows that, after the wheel speed (WS) had exceeded 60 kt during the takeoff roll (see chapter 1.6.3.2), the spoilers automatically extended without alerting the flight crew in the form of a warning (see annexes 1 and 2).As per the standard operating procedures, the flight crew has to carry out the socalled ¡®80-kt check¡¯ at an indicated airspeed (KIAS) of 80 kt (see figure 9). That is to say, both pilots have to verify that the speeds displayed on their screens are identical and that the N1 rpm is equivalent to the takeoff power required. The data shows that, by this time, the power output of N1 was set at 65.3 % instead of the required 80.7 %. Both pilots stated that they could not say for certain whether they had executed the 80-KIAS check including the associated monitoring of the power output.According to the CMD, acceleration seemed slower than usual at a speed of between 90 and 100 KIAS; however, he sensed a degree of uncertainty as takeoff was carried out at derated thrust. At that moment, the copilot notified the CMD that the FMS was working again and that the flight plan no longer displayed a discontinuity.Due to the slow acceleration, the CMD checked the set takeoff power. He then realised that it was too low and pushed the throttles forward. The data shows that the speed was 109 KIAS at this time and that the throttles had been set at a TLA of 28.5¡ã, equivalent to an N1 power output of 76.6 %. According to the flight crew¡¯s statement, they became aware almost simultaneously of the CONFIG SPOILER warning, which illuminated for four seconds. The copilot responded to this warning at once, voicing that the spoiler lever was in the retracted (RET) position. The CMD briefly considered aborting takeoff. However, as he had exceeded speed V1 (117 kt) in the meantime, he decided to continue the takeoff roll. The aircraft took off 52 seconds after takeoff was initiated, at a distance that was 1.5 times the length of the calculated takeoff distance, and approximately 1000 metres before the end of the runway.The remainder of the flight was uneventful. The aircraft landed in Geneva at 04:02:29 UTC.The captain (57, ATPL, 14,766 hours total, 301 hours on type) was assisted by a first officer (34, ATPL, 1,783 hours total, 397 hours on type), in their statements after the occurrence both did not rule out fatigue.The SUST describes the autothrottle system:The aircraft HB-JCC is equipped with an autothrottle (AT) system that automatically manages the engine thrust. When the AT is engaged and not in AT HOLD mode, the AT servomotors in the throttle quadrant assembly (TQA) automatically position the thrust levers during the complete flight profile. The AT also ensures engine synchronisation.The AT is normally engaged manually and can be disengaged at any time. The AT is highly integrated with the automatic flight control system (AFCS) and the flight management system (FMS).The AT also provides speed and thrust envelope limiting. The AT system status is displayed on the flight mode annunciator (FMA) and fault messages are displayed on the EICAS page.Before takeoff, the AT is armed by pressing the push button (p/b) on the flight control panel (FCP). The dark line above the AT p/b illuminates in green and the FMA shows AT (white) (see figure 6). The white arrow indicates that the AT uses navigation sources and altimeter settings of the left side.At takeoff, the thrust levers are advanced to approximately N1 of 50 %. Once the engines are stabilized the thrust levers are moved further forward. If the throttles are further advanced through the 23-degree Thrust Lever Angle (TLA) position (approximately 60 % N1), the AT activates and takes over thrust lever control, and the thrust levers automatically travel into the takeoff thrust position. THRUST and AT are now displayed in green and SPD (speed) is shown in white (armed). Furthermore it has to be mentioned that the TLA value is not visible to the flight crew.When the airspeed increases above 60 KIAS, the THRUST HOLD mode activates. In HOLD mode, all autothrottle commands are suspended and power is removed from the thrust levers. This means that the thrust levers and N1 speed remain at this approximate position. Normally, this position corresponds to the takeoff N1 selected through the FMS. Since the TLA in the present case was still less than 23¡ã, the AT remained armed and switched directly to HOLD mode when the speed exceeded 60 KIAS.The THRUST HOLD mode remains active until the aircraft reaches an altitude of 400 ft above ground level.The SUST described the ground spoilers:The ground spoilers operate symmetrically to provide lift dumping at touchdown. Automatic deployment of the ground spoilers is computed through the primary flight control computers (PFCC). Amongst other things, the deployment logic is based on a wheel speed (WS) of 60 kt and on the weight-on-wheels. Furthermore, the thrust lever angle (TLA) must be less than 23 degrees. The lift dump function is automatic and does not need to be armed by the pilot. Conversely, if the TLA of both throttle levers is less than 23 degrees during aircraft acceleration, the spoilers will deploy automatically if the wheel speed is above 60 kt.A respective note can be found in the checklist ¡°touch and go landing procedure¡± (FCOM Operational Guidance, chapter 08.02.02 page 7). The first note reads:¡°Ground lift dumping (GLD) are automatically deployed with weight©\on©\wheels, and retract when the thrust levers are advanced beyond a 23©\degree lever angle (approximately vertical).¡±The SUST analysed:The fact that the spoilers extended during the takeoff roll was due to their design by the manufacturer. Prerequisites for spoiler deployment are amongst others a wheel speed (WS) of more than 60 kt and a throttle lever angle (TLA) of less than 23¡ã (see chapter 1.6.3.2). Both conditions are met during a landing, a touch and go and an aborted takeoff because the throttles are in the idle position at this moment.During this serious incident, these conditions were also met because the TLA was just 20.6¡ã at the start of the takeoff roll. The spoilers therefore extended when the WS of 60 kt was exceeded. This change in configuration is only shown on the flight control (FLT CTRL) synoptic page and therefore cannot be seen by a flight crew as this page is not preset on any multifunction window (MFW) during the takeoff roll (see chapter 1.6.2). These windows furthermore display the deflections of the spoilers in green, which relates to a normal condition, and this therefore does not necessarily signal a warning.A spoiler deployment design that does not consider the acceleration vector only meets the criteria as given for an aborted takeoff, a landing and a touch and go. Therefore, information about the operation of the spoilers can only be found in the FCOM in relation to these aforementioned flight phases. The fact that the spoilers also extend without the flight crew intending or noticing during a takeoff roll, in which the critical TLA of 23¡ã is not exceeded, is not stated anywhere. In addition, a TLA equivalent N1 of approximately 60 % is specified in the section that describes the AT (FCOM page 03-05-12), but an N1 of 68 % is specified in the TAKEOFF CONFIGURATION WARNING section (FCOM page 08-05-40).The above facts lead to the conclusion that this scenario ¨C which was not an isolated incident (see chapter 1.18.1) ¨C was not considered when the spoiler deployment was designed. Yet, the fact that the spoilers can deploy during the acceleration phase of the takeoff roll without intervention from the flight crew carries great safety risks. A safety recommendation was therefore issued (see chapter 4.1.1).Only once the CMD had pushed the throttles forward at a later time did the TLA change to above 23¡ã and the spoilers retracted within 2 seconds, 23 seconds after having extended (see annex 1). As observed by the flight crew, the SPOILER CONFIG warning displayed on the EICAS for 4 seconds whilst the spoilers were retracting.The AT remained armed and switched directly to HOLD mode, when 60 KIAS wasexceeded. The power set at that time remains the same until the AT switches to THRUST mode at an altitude of 400 ft above ground. Any power not matching the required takeoff power (target N1) represents a high safety risk if there is no intervention from the flight crew (see chapter 1.18.2).When the PF pushed the throttles forward to a TLA that exceeded the critical 23¡ã at a speed of 109 KIAS, the AT should have disconnected automatically, and the crew should have been informed about this by an aural AUTOTHROTTLE alert (see chapter 1.6.3.2). Why the AT did not disconnect explained the Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA) National Aircraft Certification (NAC) by the fact that the AT switched directly from the ARM to the HOLD mode and therefore could only get active after passing 400 ft above ground level (cf. footnote 10). However, this is in contrast to the incident of HB-JCF mentioned in chapter 1.18.1 and the statement in the All Operator Message (AOM) dated 21 December 2018 and published by the manufacturer (cf. chapter 4.3.2).The SUST analysed the human factors:When lining up on runway 35, the PF armed the AT. It can be assumed that the AT was armed following the closed-loop procedure described in OM A and that the PM checked the action taken by the PF.After the flight crew had received clearance to line up and takeoff, the PF advanced the throttles. The data shows that the throttles stopped at a TLA of 20.6¡ã. The TLA of 23¡ã required to engage the AT was consequently not exceeded. As a result, the AT was not engaged and the white THRUST indicator on the FMA did not change its colour to green. During this phase, closed-loop communication obviously did not take place as intended, as the flight crew did not notice that the AT only remained armed and had not been engaged.The fact that the deployment of the spoilers went unnoticed by the flight crew can be explained by the prescribed choice of displays during takeoff (see chapter 1.6.2). This would only have been visible on the appropriate synoptic page, however the indicator for extended spoilers would have been displayed in green, which generally does not imply that they are in a wrong position.In line with the operating procedures, the flight crew had to check the speed and engine data for takeoff at a speed of 80 KIAS (see chapter 1.17.2.3). Both pilots stated that they could not remember whether they had performed this check. This cannot be explained by anything other than that the check ¨C if it took place ¨C was not performed with the required level of attention. Both the FMA indicator as well as the N1 engine data ¨C set at only 65.3 % instead of 80.7 % ¨C did not correspond with expectations. At a speed of between 90 and 100 KIAS, the PF became aware of the unusually low level of acceleration, noticed that the power output did not meet the required takeoff power, and advanced the throttles further. The data shows that a TLA of 28.5¡ã was thereby reached, which is only equivalent to an N1 rpm of 76.6 % and was still below the calculated takeoff power. The fact that this lack of required power continued until the AT automatically changed modes at an altitude of 400 ft above ground suggests that the flight crew was unaware of the power actually set.In light of the remaining length of the runway and the required obstacle clearance along the takeoff path, in particular in the event of engine failure, it is advisable in a situation such as this that the thrust levers are pushed forward to the mechanical stop. This would cause the AT to disconnect and the appropriate warnings to be triggered, which would however result in maximum possible takeoff thrust being initiated (see chapter 1.6.3.2). This is particularly relevant during a takeoff with derated takeoff thrust.When the CONFIG SPOILER warning was displayed, the PM immediately checked that the spoiler lever was in the retracted position and confirmed this to the PF. This reaction is understandable, as the flight crew had ¨C as is reasonable ¨C not anticipated the spoilers to deploy automatically during a takeoff roll. The PF briefly considered aborting takeoff but dismissed this thought as the decision speed V1 (117 kt) had already been exceeded in the meantime. According to the data, the CONFIG SPOILER warning displayed one second after the throttles had been advanced and disappeared four seconds later. The decision not to abort the takeoff was appropriate for the situation because, when aborting a takeoff after V1, it can never be said with any certainty whether an aircraft can be brought to a stop on the remaining length of the runway.
An Air Creebec de Havilland Dash 8-100, registration C-GTCO performing flight YN-926 from Rouyn,QC to Montreal,QC (Canada) with 6 passengers and 3 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Rouyn's runway 26 at 21:34L (02:34Z Jan 24th) when the aircraft struck a wall of snow with its left main gear and veered off the runway to the left coming to a stop in snow south of the runway. The aircraft was evacuated. The Canadian TSB reported one person received minor injuries. The aircraft was towed back to the apron, the damage to the aircraft is currently being assessed.On Mar 9th 2020 the TSB released their final report concluding the probable causes of the accident were:- The pilot flying did not look far enough ahead for long enough to notice that the aircraft was deviating to the left before veering off the runway.- Given that the pilot monitoring was not looking out the window to monitor the aircrafts path, he did not notice the deviation and was therefore unable to help the pilot flying correct the deviation in the path during the take-off roll.- The strong authority gradient between the pilots reduced the effectiveness of monitoring, which resulted in a failure to detect and correct the deviation from the departure path.- During the takeoff-rejection procedure, the pilot flying accidentally caught the right engine power lever with his finger, pushing the lever completely forward, and placed only the left lever in the idle position, which produced a significant dissymmetry in the torque and accentuated the deviation from the path, resulting in the runway excursion.- Since the pilot flying was able to place only 1 power lever in the idle position, it is highly likely that he did not have his right hand on the levers, contrary to what is stated in the standard operating procedures. Consequently, he was not ready to quickly and safely reject the takeoff.Findings as to risk- If pilots do not carry out a take-off briefing, they may not have a shared mental model of the actions that must be taken during the takeoff, increasing the risk of an accident.- If the roles and responsibilities of the pilot flying and pilot monitoring are not well defined, monitoring may not be effective, increasing the risk that an aircrafts deviation from its path may fail to be detected and corrected.- If the accompanying pilot is not informed of the other pilots state of health before the flight, the accompanying pilot will be less prepared to take rapid and appropriate action as necessary, which could impact flight safety.- If operators do not take into account the restrictions associated with pilots licences when assigning crew members to a flight, they risk pairing 2 pilots who both have a restriction associated with their licence requiring that they fly with an accompanying pilot, which eliminates the protection put in place by Transport Canada to reduce risks in the event of pilot incapacitation.The captain (ATPL, 12,500 hours total, 8,000 hours on type) was pilot flying, the first officer (CPL, 1000 hours total, 300 hours on type) was pilot monitoring.The TSB described the sequence of events:At 2136:38, the aircraft reached the runway threshold and began its take-off roll without first coming to a stop. The aircraft was 17 feet to the left of the runway centreline, on a heading of 4° to the left of the runway centreline (Figure 1, position 1). Visibility was approximately 2 statute miles (SM) in snow showers. The crew could see the runway edge lights along the entire runway, but could not see the runway centreline markings, which were covered with snow.Throughout the take-off roll, the aircraft maintained a heading of 4° to the left, but the crew did not notice that the aircraft was veering to the left, getting further and further away from the runway centreline.At 2136:50, when the aircraft had reached a speed of approximately 80 knots, the PF realized that the aircraft was near the left edge of the runway. As soon as the aircraft reached 80 knots, 12 seconds after beginning its take-off roll, the left main landing gear rolled off the runway surface and hit the snow windrow 5 feet beyond the edge of the runway (Figure 1, position 2). The left wheel then lost speed rapidly and the aircraft spun approximately 5° to the left. The PF attempted to control the aircrafts direction using the rudder pedals, and decided to reject the takeoff by reducing engine power.At 2136:53, intending to grab both power levers with his right hand, the PF caught the right engine lever with his little finger, pushing it completely forward. At the same time, the PF only succeeded in grabbing the left engine lever and pulling it back completely. The asymmetric power made the aircraft veer even further to the left. The PF then tried to control the aircraft using the rudder pedals, but the nose wheel and right main landing gear also hit the snow windrow. The PF continued to try controlling the aircrafts direction using the rudder pedals, but the aircraft continued to veer to the left. Approximately 5 seconds later, the aircraft hit a compact snowbank approximately 36 inches high about 40 feet beyond the edge of the runway, and spun rapidly to the left.At 2137:01, the PF reduced power to the right engine.At 2137:04, the aircraft came to a stop 3000 feet from the threshold and 200 feet to the left of the Runway 26 centreline, on a heading of 147° (Figure 1, position 3 and Figure 2). The PF then carried out the engine shutdown procedure.The captain advised the FSS of the runway excursion and gave the order to evacuate the aircraft, but then changed his mind when he noticed that there was no danger and everyone could remain inside the passenger cabin while waiting for the emergency response crew. The emergency vehicles arrived, then the passengers were deplaned using the main door and taken to the terminal in the emergency vehicles.One of the passengers received minor injuries. The aircraft sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, landing gear and propellers. The inspection of the aircraft after the accident revealed no faults before the impact that may have caused the aircraft to veer during the take-off roll.The TSB analysed:Given that Air Creebec serves many aerodromes where the runway has no centreline markings, the captain had enough experience to conduct a takeoff on such a runway. At night, with no visual references on either side of the runway, and with no runway markings visible on the snow-covered runway, the runway edge lights and the centre area at the point where the 2 rows of edge lights converge provide acceptable visual references for positioning the aircraft close to the centre of the runway on a heading close to the runway heading. It is possible for an aircraft to begin accelerating on takeoff while it is not exactly in the centre of the runway or exactly aligned on the runway heading. However, if the pilot looks far enough ahead for long enough during acceleration, the visual references produce a perceptible optical flow that enables the pilot to maintain the aircraft in the centre of the runway on the desired heading and to detect deviations from the centre of the runway.In this occurrence, the pilot had positioned the aircraft 17 feet to the left of the runway centreline, on a heading of 4° to the left of the runway alignment. This heading was maintained without being corrected for approximately 12 seconds, until the left main landing gear hit the snow windrow.Good spatial orientation begins with perception of external visual references to determine the current position, then anticipation of future positions by assimilating information pertaining to the speed, acceleration and direction of objects and surfaces in the observers field of vision. The runway edge lights and the centre area where the 2 rows of edge lights converged were sufficient to provide the crew with visual references that would help them to detect a deviation from the centre of the runway. However, the PF did not look far enough ahead for long enough to notice that the aircraft was deviating to the left before veering off the runway....Although the PM does not handle the flight controls directly, he or she plays a crucial role in the execution of a takeoff. According to Air Creebecs standard operating procedures (SOPs), the PM must check that the spoilers are retracted and the autofeather system is activated; once the aircraft has reached 80% torque, the PM must call Through 80% torque and set power to take-off power; once a speed of 70 knots has been reached, the PM must call 70 knots, power set; finally, once the decision speed (V1 ) has been reached, the PM must call V1, rotate.37 Given that takeoff occurs quickly, the PM must direct his or her attention to the right place at the right time and spend enough time monitoring the flights progress and completing all of the tasks required for the take-off roll.The evening of the accident, the PM completed all of his tasks and made all of the standard calls during the take-off roll. However, given that the PM was not looking out the window to monitor the aircrafts path, he did not notice the deviation and was therefore unable to help the PF correct the deviation in the path during the take-off roll....If the roles and responsibilities of the PF and PM are not well defined, monitoring may not be effective, increasing the risk that an aircrafts deviation from its path may fail to be detected and corrected.The lack of monitoring effectiveness between the crew members on the evening of the accident may be linked to a strong authority gradient between the PF and PM. On one hand, the PM did not believe that it was important to monitor the departure path since the PF was highly experienced. On the other hand, the PF felt obliged to closely monitor the actions taken by the PM, who was not very experienced, which diverted the PFs attention longer toward what was happening inside the cockpit. The strong authority gradient between the pilots reduced the effectiveness of monitoring, which resulted in a failure to detect and correct the deviation from the departure path.When the left main landing gear hit the snow windrow, the PF decided to reject the takeoff. However, during the takeoff-rejection procedure, the PF accidentally caught the right engine power lever with his finger, pushing the lever completely forward, and placed only the left lever in the idle position, which produced a significant dissymmetry in the torque and accentuated the deviation from the path, resulting in the runway excursion.Since the PF was able to place only 1 power lever in the idle position, it is highly likely that he did not have his right hand on the levers, contrary to what is stated in SOPs. Consequently, he was not ready to quickly and safely reject the takeoff.Metars:CYUY 240400Z 01005KT 3SM -SN VV030 M10/M11 A2951 RMK SN8 /S02/ SLP019=CYUY 240342Z 02006KT 3SM -SN VV030 M10/M11 A2951 RMK SN8 PRESFR SLP019=CYUY 240300Z 03005KT 3/4SM -SN VV011 M10/M11 A2954 RMK SN8 SLP027=CYUY 240254Z 03005KT 3/4SM -SN VV013 M10/M11 A2955 RMK SN8 SLP030=CYUY 240247Z 02006KT 2SM -SN VV013 M10/M11 A2954 RMK SN8 SLP029=CYUY 240203Z 03006KT 3SM -SN BKN038 OVC068 M10/M11 A2955 RMK SN3SC3AC2 SLP030=CYUY 240200Z 03005KT 2 1/4SM -SN OVC038 M10/M11 A2955 RMK SN5SC3 /S01/ SLP031=CYUY 240112Z 02006KT 2SM -SN VV020 M10/M11 A2958 RMK SN8 PRESRR SLP041=CYUY 240100Z 03007KT 3SM -SN VV020 M10/M11 A2957 RMK SN8 SLP037=CYUY 240012Z 04006KT 1 1/2SM -SN VV012 M09/M11 A2958 RMK SN8 SLP042=CYUY 240000Z 04007KT 2SM -SN OVC020 M10/M11 A2959 RMK SN7SC1 SLP047=CYUY 232300Z 06007KT 2 1/4SM -SN OVC016 M10/M11 A2960 RMK SN4SC4 PRESFR SLP050=CYUY 232239Z 07006KT 2SM -SN OVC015 M10/M11 A2963 RMK SN4SC4 SLP058=CYUY 232200Z 04005KT 1SM -SN OVC012 M10/M11 A2965 RMK SN5SC3 VIS VRB 3/4-11/4 /S03/ SLP067=The aircraft seen after being towed in (Photo: Air Creebec):
A UPS United Parcel Service Boeing 747-400, registration N576UP performing flight 5X-15 from Delhi (India) to Cologne (Germany), was accelerating for takeoff from Delhi's runway 11 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 110 knots over ground). The aircraft slowed safely, vacated the runway and was taxiing on taxiway T when all main tyres deflated disabling the aircraft on taxiway T between taxiways T3 and CW1.The aircraft is still in that position (standing Mar 5th 2020).Related NOTAMs:A0279/20 NOTAMR A0278/20Q) VIDF/QMXAU/IV/NBO/A/000/999/A) VIDP B) 2003041145 C) 2003051230E) PORTION OF TWY T BTN CW 1 AND T3 NOT AVBL DUE DISABLED ACFT.

An Avient Aviation McDonnell Douglas MD-11 freighter, registration Z-BAV performing flight Z3-324 from Shanghai Pudong (China) to Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan) with 7 crew, overran runway 35R (4000 meters/13123 feet long) on takeoff and burst into flames at about 08:12L (00:12Z). All occupants received injuries and were taken to local hospitals, where three died. Three of the survivors received serious, the fourth received critical injuries but is in stable condition.Pudong's runways 35L (third runway built) and 35R (first runway built) had to be closed, runway 35L could be reopened 6 hours after the crash. Runway 34 (second runway built) continued to operate all time. About 50 fire engines were at the scene to extinguish the fires.There are reports, that the airplane had already rotated for takeoff but failed to become airborne resulting in at least one tailstrike.A Shanghai based pilot witnessing the crash said, that the main gear left the ground just before the end of the runway, the airplane however did not climb more than 10 feet, impacted approach lights and antennas and fell back onto the ground.Photos (see second image below) support the observation of the Shanghai based pilot showing some tops of the approach lights being damaged and subsequent gear tracks on soft ground until the airplane began to break up.The three fatalities as well as the critically injured are US citizens, another Belgium, Indonesian and a Zimbabwean were on board of the airplane.The hospital says, that the injured US citizen is currently stable suffering from multiple rib fractures, blast lung injury and pneumothorax. Doctors are hopeful to scale down the injury condition from critical to serious in about 72 hours unless complications occur. The other three survivors received injuries mainly to chest and limbs.China's Civil Aviation Accident Investigation Board joined by the NTSB have recovered the black boxes of the aircraft.Avient Aviation is registered in Harare (Zimbabwe). Z-BAV (msn: 48408) was formerly registered as N408SH, PR-LGD (Varig Logistica) and HL7372 (Korean Air). Avient Aviation had received the airplane just 8 days earlier. The airplane should have flown to Harare (Zimbabwe) via Bishkek.Over the recent more than 10 years The Aviation Herald attempted several times to get hold of the final report via Chinese Authorities, ICAO and other resources but failed to obtain the final report. On Feb 28th 2020 The Aviation Herald however received a brief abstract in Chinese, which includes the conclusions of the accident investigation. The abstract of the investigation results reads (translated to English by AVH):The crew did not properly operate the thrust levers so that the engines did not reach take off thrust. The aircraft had not reached Vr at the end of the runway and could not get airborne.According to the design criteria of the MD11 the crew needs to push at least two thrust levers to beyond 60 degrees, which will trigger autothrust to leave "CLAMP" mode and adjust the thrust to reach the target setting for takeoff, the servo motors would push the thrust levers forward in that case. During the accident departure the pilot in the left seat did not advance the thrust levers to more than 60 degrees, hence the server motors did not work although autothrust was engaged bur remained in CLAMP mode and thus did not adjust the thrust to reach takeoff settings.The crew members perceived something was wrong. Audibly the engine sound was weak, visibibly the speed of the aircraft was low, tactically the pressure on the back of the seat was weaker than normal. Somebody within the crew, possibly on the observer seats, suggested the aircraft may be a bit heavy. The T/O THRUST page never appeared (it appears if autothrust is engaged and changes from CLAMP to Thrust Limit setting. Under normal circumstances with autothrust being engaged a click sound will occur as soon as the thrust levers reach the takeoff thrust position. A hand held on the thrust levers will feel the lever moving forward, however, the crew entirely lost situational awareness. None of the anomalies described in this paragraph prompted the crews members' attention.When the aircraft approached the end of the runway several options were available: reject takeoff and close the throttles, continue takeoff and push the throttle to the forward mechanical stop, continue takeoff and immediately rotate. The observer called "rotate", the captain rotated the aircraft. This shows the crew recognized the abnormal situation but did not identify the error (thrust levers not in takeoff position) in a hurry but reacted instinctively only. As the aircraft had not yet reached Vr, the aircraft could not get airborne when rotated. As verified in simulator verification the decision to rotate was the wrong decision. The simulator verification showed, that had the crew pushed the thrust levers into maximum thrust when they recognized the abnormal situation, they would have safely taken the aircraft airborne 670 meters before the end of the runway. The verification also proved, that had the crew rejected takeoff at that point, the aircraft would have stopped before the end of the runway.The crew did not follow standard operating procedures for managing thrust on takeoff. The crew operations manual stipulates that the left seat pilot advances the thrust levers to EPR 1.1 or 70% N1 (depending on engine type), informs the right seat pilot to connect autothrust. The pilot flying subsequently pushes the thrust levers forward and verifies they are moving forward on servos, the pilot monitoring verifies autothrust is working as expected and reaches takeoff thrust settings. In this case the left seat pilot not only did not continue to push the thrust levers forward, but also called out "thrust set" without reason as he did not verify the takeoff thrust setting had been achieved.It is not possible to subdivide the various violations of procedures and regulations. The crew had worked 16 hours during the previous sector. In addition, one crew member needed to travel for 11 hours from Europe to reach the point of departure of the previous sector (Nairobi Kenya), two crew members need to travel for 19 hours from America to the point of departure of the previous sector. These factors caused fatigue to all crew membes. The co-pilot was 61 years of age, pathological examination showed he was suffering from hypertension and cardiovascular atherosclerosis. His physical strength and basic health may have affected the tolerance towards fatigue. All crew members underwent changes across multiple time zones in three days. Although being in the period of awakeness in their biological rhythm cycle, the cycle was already in a trough period causing increased fatigue.The captain had flown the Airbus A340 for 300 hours in the last 6 months, which has an entirely different autothrust handling, e.g. the thrust levers do not move with power changes in automatic thrust, which may have caused the captain to ignore the MD-11 thrust levers. The co-pilot in the right hand seat had been MD-11 captain for about 7 years but had not flown the MD-11 for a year. Both were operating their first flight for the occurrence company. The two pilots on the observer seats had both 0 flight hours in the last 6 months. The co-pilot (right hand seat) was pilot flying for the accident sector. The captain thus was responsible for the thrust management and thrust lever movement according to company manual. A surviving observer told the investigation in post accident interviews that the captain was filling out forms and failed to monitor the aircraft and first officer's actions during this critical phase of flight.There are significant design weaknesses in the MD-11 throttle, the self checks for errors as well as degree of automation is not high.Metars:ZSPD 280130Z 01008MPS CAVOK 12/07 Q1028 NOSIG ZSPD 280100Z 01009MPS 9999 SCT020 12/06 Q1028 NOSIG ZSPD 280030Z 01007MPS 9999 SCT020 12/07 Q1028 NOSIGZSPD 280000Z 36007MPS 9999 SCT020 12/07 Q1027 NOSIGZSPD 272330Z 01008MPS 9999 FEW020 12/07 Q1027 NOSIGZSPD 272300Z 01008MPS CAVOK 12/07 Q1027 NOSIG ZSPD 272230Z 02009MPS 9999 OVC040 12/07 Q1027 NOSIG ZSPD 272200Z 01008MPS 9999 OVC040 12/07 Q1026 NOSIG Crash Site (Photo: AFP/China Out): Damaged runway lights and landing gear tracks on the ground (Photo: AFP/Ray Young): Map (Courtesy Google Earth): 
A Jetstar Airbus A320-200, registration VH-VFX performing flight JQ-529 from Sydney,NS to Melbourne,VI (Australia) with 174 passengers and 6 crew, was preparing for departure when the flight crew computed the takeoff data. However, both flight crew had not updated their electronic flight bags prior to the first flight of the day, the pilot monitoring had updated his EFB just prior to the occurrence flight, the pilot flying still had the old database. The pilot monitoring entered the data computed by his EFB into the FMS, the pilot flying subsequently verified the data and found discrepancies. While troubleshooting the discrepancies the crew discovered the EFB of the pilot flying had the old database on it, the pilot flying attempted to update his EFB, however, his EFB only showed the busy indication continuously and was effectively inoperative. The same happened to the spare EFB on board of the aircraft, which too had an old database on it and showed permanently "busy" after the update was started. The crew thus reverted to manually computing the takeoff performance data, the crew subsequently agreed that their V1 was 157 KIAS, Vr 161 KIAS and V2 164 KIAS. The aircraft subsequently departed Sydney's runway 16R, began rotation at 169 KIAS at 2.8 degrees/s, reached 11.6 degrees nose up about 6 seconds after becoming airborne, the airspeed increased through 189 KIAS above the maximum flap speed. The pilot monitoring had called "Speed! Speed!" to warn the pilot flying their speed was accelerating towards maximum flaps speed and omitted the call "positive climb". In response to the speed call the pilot flying reduced the thrust (rather than increasing the pitch) at 144 feet AGL while still below the thrust reduction height of 800 feet. The flaps were retracted from position 3 to position 1, the thrust lever was placed into the climb detent and the autopilot was engaged. The aircraft continued the climb and the flaps were subsequently retracted. The crew became aware of buffeting noises, discovered the APU was still supplying bleed air, thinking this was the source of the buffeting noises they turned the APU bleed air off according to standard operating procedures. The buffeting noises continued however. The flight crew subsequently realised the landing gear was still down, the pilot flying called "gear up" and the pilot monitoring selected the gear lever up without checking the speed. The aircraft was already flying at 250 KIAS with the maximum gear retraction speed being 220 KIAS. The flight crew discussed the occurrence, in the absence of any abnormal indication they continued the flight to Melbourne where the aircraft landed without further incident.The ATSB released their final report releasing following findings:- The flight crew did not follow standard operating procedures to verify and update Flysmart database during sign on for the day.- When using manual calculations to obtain performance speeds, the flight crew made an error which was not detected by independent validation. This resulted in a calculated rotation speed based on an aircraft weight significantly heavier than the actual take-off weight.- The rotation rate commanded by the pilot flying was too low to prevent a flap overspeed, given the incorrect performance speeds and use of maximum take-off thrust.- In an attempt to manage the airspeed, the pilot flying reduced the thrust from the take-off setting, rather than increasing the pitch, but the aircraft was below the safe altitude above the ground to do so.- The landing gear was not retracted at the normal phase of the take-off.When the flight crew identified that the landing gear was still extended, they retracted it immediately, even though the aircraft was above the maximum landing gear retraction speed.The ATSB reported the captain was pilot flying, the first officer was pilot monitoring.The ATSB analysed:Electronic flight bagThe flight crew did not have the same database versions on their electronic flight bags (EFB). The standard operating procedures required the version to be checked at sign-on each day. Had this been completed the databases on the flight crews EFBs would have been the same and the current database. Although the operator reported that the discrepancy should not have made a difference to the performance results obtained for this flight, had both databases been up to date, it is more likely the crew would have considered the source of the discrepancy between the two EFBs was related to something else, such as a data entry, and resolved the discrepancy.Manual calculations of performance speedsInstead of using the one serviceable EFB, the crew reverted to the manual take-off charts to calculate the performance speeds, a procedure rarely practiced by the crew. When using the manual performance tables to derive take-off speeds, it was unlikely the flight crew completed the full procedure for the manual calculation. The instruction to move down the wind column appears at the top of the second page of instructions. It was likely that this step, and subsequent steps, were overlooked, resulting in performance speeds for the maximum regulated take-off weight (RTOW) being used.The ATSB could not establish whether both of the flight crew independently made the same calculation error or if the results were not independently validated by the pilot flying (PF). Either way, the error by the pilot monitoring (PM) was not detected by the PF.Rotation and flap overspeedThe actual rotation speed of 169 kt was only 16 kt below the maximum flap extended speed (185 kt), 41 kt closer than the correct rotation speed would have been. The PF rotated the aircraft at a rate significantly below the recommended rate of 3°/s. This resulted in the aircraft attitude reaching 10.5° pitch-up, instead of 15°, 5 seconds after rotation when the maximum flap extended speed was exceeded. The pitch attitude reached 15°; 11 seconds after rotation.It is likely that the SRS was indicating guidance to the PF to increase the pitch, which, had the PF followed, would have reduced the aircraft acceleration. According to the simulation conducted by Airbus, if a 3°/s pitch rate had been achieved, the flap overspeed would not have occurred.The PM did not bring to the attention of the PF the incorrect pitch attitude at take-off. Had the PM called pitch it may have prompted the PF to increase the pitch. Jetstar stated this call was not specifically published, like many calls a PM would need to make to identify an incorrect control input.Thrust managementWhen the PM called speed, speed, the PF reduced the engine power in response, as opposed to increasing the aircraft pitch. The thrust reduction occurred below the thrust reduction altitude and therefore had the potential to affect safety of the flight.Landing gear retraction overspeed eventThe retraction of the landing gear was not performed when positive climb was achieved. While troubleshooting a buffeting sound, the PF found that the landing gear was still extended and called gear up. The PM immediately retracted the landing gear without checking the aircrafts actual airspeed relative to the maximum landing gear retraction speed. This resulted in an overspeed event when the landing gear was retracted beyond the maximum landing retraction speed. The correct procedure was to reduce the aircrafts speed below the maximum landing gear speed before retracting the landing gear. There is no aircraft warning associated with this event.
A South African Airlink Embraer ERJ-170 on behalf of SAA South African Airways, registration ZS-YBC performing flight SA-8428 from Kimberley to Johannesburg (South Africa), was accelerating for takeoff from Kimberley's runway 28 when at about Vr the crew spotted a bird on the runway which flew up towards the right of the aircraft. The right hand engine (CF34) ingested the bird, emitted banging sounds and vibrations and lost thrust. The crew stopped the climb at 8000 feet and returned to Kimberley for a safe landing on runway 02 about 30 minutes after departure.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Kimberley a month later.South Africa's CAA is looking into the occurrence.
A GoAir Airbus A320-200N, registration VT-WGY performing flight G8-802 from Ahmedabad to Bangalore (India), was accelerating for takeoff from Ahmedabad's runway 05 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed due a right hand engine (PW1127G) failure and fire indication. Emergency services responded and sprayed the right hand engine quickly dousing the fire.The airline reported a borescopic inspection of the engine revealed a bird had been ingested by the engine causing damage to the engine and a small fire.A replacement A320-200 registration VT-GOO reached Bangalore with a delay of 4:20 hours.
An Air India Airbus A321-200, registration VT-PPU performing flight AI-852 from Pune to Delhi (India) with 180 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Pune's runway 10 when the crew spotted a jeep and a person on the runway and initiated rotation of the aircraft prematurely at about 130 knots over ground. The aircraft's tail contacted the runway surface, the aircraft climbed out safely, the crew climbed the aircraft to FL330 and continued to Delhi, where the aircraft landed safely on runway 29 about 110 minutes after departure. Ground staff inspecting the aircraft found damage to the tail skin, maintenance subsequently established also structural damage to fuselage frames.India's DGCA have opened an investigation into the occurence, both pilots have been de-rostered until the end of the investigation. The DGCA states it is unclear why the crew continued the flight to Delhi, the probe will focus also onto whether the crew was aware of the extent of the damage the fuselage received and whether a tail strike sensor was installed and operative on the aircraft. The black boxes were secured and are being read out.India's Air Force confirmed during the morning hours a service vehicle had been cleared for a routine task on Pune's runway, the service vehicle was near the runway forcing the A321 to rotate earlier than planned. The aircraft continued to Delhi for a safe landing. The Air Force is conducting an investigation, too.The tail damage:
An Aer Lingus Airbus A320-200, registration EI-DEF performing flight EI-681 from Geneva (Switzerland) to Dublin (Ireland), had been cleared for immediate takeoff from Geneva's runway 05, a British Airways Airbus A320-200 registration G-EUYS performing flight BA-726 from London Heathrow,EN (UK) to Geneva (Switzerland) was on final approach to runway 05 when tower made a frantic transmission "Foxtrott Victor, hold position here" following by the instruction to BA-726 to go around due to traffic on the runway. After the BA crew had confirmed to go around, tower explained an A320 had "fortunately just departed without serious problems", called the Aer Lingus: "Are you okay?", reply by the crew: "Affirm, we had enough room to take a right around the traffic but luckily we were okay!", tower then inquired with the offending aircraft, a Cessna Citation 525 registration N990FV (with part of call sign being "Foxtrott Victor") taxiing for departure, whether they were okay and received "Thank you", then issued instruction to vacate the runway and contact apron (ground control).The British Airways A320 positioned for another approach and landed safely, the Aer Lingus A320 continued to Dublin for a safe landing.The C525 had received taxiing instruction from the General Aviation Apron to runway 05 about 5 minutes prior to the occurrence and was taxiing along taxiway Z. About one minute prior to the occurrence tower transmitted "Two Niner Mike Foxtrott Right here Contact Apron" (editorial note of Jul 28th 2015: originally understood by this editor as an instruction to N990FV to contact Apron, 29MF however referring to Swiss 29MF, LX-2973 Dash 8-400 OE-LGL having arrived from Lugano, editorial update of Feb 12th 2020: with the final report it became clear that the "right here" occurred on tower to the Dash and "here right" on ground to the Cessna, both remarks therefore occurred, the "here right" should have instructed the Cessna to turn off taxiway Z into the holding bay Z and contact tower to await further clearance to cross the runway), issued the takeoff clearance for Aer Lingus, the C525 subsequently unexpectedly crossed hold short line Z coming to a stop at the runway edge while the Aer Lingus was already in the takeoff roll.On Jul 28th 2015 Switzerland's SUST reported the Cessna Citation C525 registration N990FV committed a runway incursion at intersection with taxiway Z while the Aer Lingus A320 was taking off. The Air Prox Occurrence is being investigated by the SUST.On Feb 12th 2020 Switzerland's SUST released their final report reporting the minimum distance between the aircraft was 24 meters/79 feet and concluding the probable causes of the serious incident were:The serious incident is attributable to the dangerous convergence between an Airbus A320 on its take-off roll on concrete runway 05 and a Cessna C525 which had crossed the CAT I runway holding position of taxiway Z without clearance.Factors contributing to the runway incursion:- lack of a hot spot indicating the danger of a concrete runway 05 incursion at taxiway Z;- lack of situational awareness of the flight crew of N990FV;- lack of vigilance of the GND controller;- lack of a stop bar at runway holding position CAT I on taxiway Z;- air traffic control operational procedures not adapted to the risk of a runway incursion for aircraft taxiing from the north apron.The SUST reported the Cessna crew was preparing for departure and had requested a departure clearance, which was properly received. The ground controller then changed before the crew reported to be ready for taxi. The SUST thus wrote:At 08:41:19 UTC, N990FV called Geneva GND to report that it was ready to roll. In the interval between the two calls, a new air traffic controller took over the GND workstation. He answered: "Roger, November nine nine zero Foxtrot Victor, taxi to holding bay Zulu runway zero five. N990FV read this back in these terms: Zulu, runway zero five, niner zero Foxtrot Victor. The workload and complexity in the GND sector were assessed as normal by its controller.The pilots of the Cessna C525 started to taxi even though they had not completed the full flight preparation; they were under time pressure because a take-off slot had been assigned to them. They thought they would be able to reach taxiway Z by the shortest route and left the stand by the left. The GND controller did not notice that they were leaving in the wrong direction. This route is a dead end and they were obliged to turn around and pass by the east of the north apron to join taxiway Y which skirts grass runway 05, the centre line of which is 252 m from that of the concrete runway.At 08:43:26 UTC, the ADC controller made radiotelephone contact with EIN68N, an Airbus A320 which was making a flight to Dublin and which was approaching the threshold of concrete runway 05. He intended fitting it in between a Dash 8 in final approach phase and a British Airways Airbus A320 established on the ILS3, the airspeed of which he brought down to its minimum value. The flight crew of EIN68N replied that they were ready to depart after the next landing.The ADC controller, who was also handling the VFR traffic, then successively cleared the landings of a light aircraft on grass runway 05 and then the Dash 8 on concrete runway 05.At 08:44:23 UTC, EIN68N was cleared to line up and prepare for an imminent takeoff after the landing of the Dash 8.When they arrived at the end of taxiway Y, the pilots of N990FV saw, in front of them and slightly to the left, a light aircraft on final approach for grass runway 05. Its path would take it over taxiway Z which they would be using and which would give them access to the holding bay and then to concrete runway 05.Not knowing if they were cleared without any further formalities to pass below this aircraft's path, they stopped at the GATE Z taxiway intersection sign and at 08:45:22 UTC reported to the GND controller that they were holding at Z. The latter thought this was a call from a different flight, Belavia BEL872, requested its source and obtained confirmation of the message. He replied Roger, you may taxi into the holding bay. Since the pilots did not seem to understand the clearance, the controller reconsidered and instructed them to let pass the traffic on very short final for the grass. The pilots reported that they had the traffic in sight, then entered taxiway Z located directly on their left, at a right angle.The GND controller then replied to BEL872 which requested its departure clearance for Minsk: Roger BEL872, expect route MOLUS 3N and I will call you back in a few minutes, unable yet to activate your flight plan.At 08:46:17 UTC, the ADC controller informed EIN68N that a helicopter was flying over the runway centre line from left to right then cleared it for immediate take-off at 08:46:31 UTC.At the same time, when N990FV was approaching holding bay Z, the GND controller indicated here right to the crew (editorial note: to enter the holding bay and stop) and instructed them to contact the control tower on the 118.7 MHz frequency: November nine nine zero Foxtrot Victor, here right and contact tower on one one eight decimal seven, goodbye.The commander replied that they were going right and read back the frequency change: Going to right, eighteen point seven, goodbye, merci, nine zero Foxtrot Victor. The Cessna C525, however, continued straight ahead at an average speed of 12 kt. It crossed the CAT I Z runway holding position markings4 at 08:46:56 UTC and approached concrete runway 05. The copilot, who was busy carrying out tasks in the cockpit, was not looking outside.At 08:46:59 UTC, the RIMCAS5 safety net reported a critical convergence on the runway, generating the aural warning RIMCAS and illuminating the radar labels of N990FV and EIN68N in red on the screens of the SAMAX runway monitoring system. The latter was then approximately 670 m from the intersection of taxiway Z with concrete runway 05, at a speed of 77 kt. N990FV was advancing at 11 kt.When the Cessna C525 was almost 30 m from the edge of the runway, the GND controller became aware of the runway incursion6, got up from his seat, swore and instructed it immediately to stop: hold position here!. The instruction given at 08:47:02 UTC overlapped the radiotelephone contact by a light aircraft which requested taxi clearance to the local aero clubs stands.The ADC controller, who was busy with the workload and complexity of the traffic which he judged to be moderate to heavy, was not aware of the runway incursion by N990FV which, at that time, had still not contacted him. He did not hear the RIMCAS warning but, alerted by his colleagues expressive reaction, saw the Cessna C525 approaching the edge of the concrete runway. He judged that EIN68N was moving quickly and that instructing a rejected take-off risked causing it to deviate to the left in the direction of the intruder. He consequently chose to inform it and to tell it to proceed to the right: Shamrock six eight November, caution, ?????, proceed to the right, traffic is interfering on runway. The message was transmitted at 08:47:05 UTC when the speeds of EIN68N and N990FV were 106 kt and 9kt respectively.The commander of N990FV saw on his right, on concrete runway 05, the Airbus A320 on its take-off roll, braked hard and immobilised his aircraft.EIN68N immediately acknowledged receipt of the warning and at the same time N990FV called ADC control, causing garbling.The commander of EIN68N had already seen and reported to the copilot the aircraft on taxiway Z which was advancing slowly and which seemed to him not yet to have crossed the markings located before the edge of the runway. When he carried out a very slight evasive manoeuvre to the right, it appeared clear to him that the conflicting aircraft had stopped before the runway. He nevertheless scheduled a rejected take-off but considered that this manoeuvre was likely to cause handling difficulties. The Airbus A320 took off normally, positioned on the centre line of runway 05.At 08:47:10 UTC the aural RIMCAS warning ended.At 08:47:11 UTC the Airbus crossed taxiway Z and the tip of its left wing passed approximately 24 m from the nose of the Cessna C525.At 08:47:25 UTC, the ADC controller instructed the British Airways A320 Airbus which was on final approach approximately 0.5 NM from the runway threshold to go around. The SUST sumarized the testimony of the Cessna Crew:For the purpose of the investigation, the commander and the copilot of N990FV were interviewed by the investigation bureau of the United States National Transportation Safety Board - NTSB.The two pilots stated they had difficulties in understanding the air traffic controller because of his pronounced accent in English. The commander stated on several occasions that the radiotelephone conversations were unclear; the term holding bay was unknown to him.They explained that a new standard instrument departure had been assigned to them while they were taxiing. The commander stated that such a change when they were rolling close to an active area constituted by the portion of taxiway Z located below the final approach path for grass runway 05 represented a challenge.The commander recalled that he had been cleared to cross runway 05 after he had heard the registration of the aircraft which was landing on the grass runway.The copilot stated that at the time of the serious incident he was not looking outside because he was busy finding the new standard departure.The commander recalled having identified runway holding position CAT I Z but did not see the Wig-Wag runway guard lights.The SUST summarized the testimony by the Ground Controller:The GND controller stated that pilots seldom read back clearances in their entirety and that consequently he found it normal that the flight crew of N990FV had never read back the Holding bay Z limit.He recalled having heard the aural RIMCAS warning but it was not that which drew his attention to the runway incursion by N990FV.He was aware of the hot spot on taxiway Z and considered that it was primarily information intended for pilots.The SUST analysed: "The aural RIMCAS (runway incursion monitoring and collision avoidance system) warning signalled the runway incursion of N990FV though did not attract the attention of the GND and ADC controllers who were managing ordinary traffic situations: the RIMCAS system therefore did not play its role of a safety net."The SUST analysed: "When taxiing to runway 05, taxiways G, Z, Y and A widen to a holding bay. To enable optimal management of the traffic flows entering the runway, the stop bars at the Cat II runway holding position markings are not permanently illuminated. On taxiway Z, access to concrete runway 05 is therefore not barred by default by the lights, the red colour of which indicates to pilots an absolute boundary which must not be crossed. The risk of a runway incursion is identified there and was, moreover, indicated in advance by a hot spot on the aerodrome charts."The SUST analysed human factors with respect to the ground controller:Between the moment when the taxi clearance was requested by the copilot of N990FV and the occurrence of the serious incident, several facts reveal that the vigilance of the GND controller was relaxed:- He accepted that the readback of the taxi clearance issued to N990FV at08:41:29 UTC did not include the clearance limit holding bay Z;- He did not notice that N990FV had left its stand to the left, towards a dead end;- He did not realise that the hesitant and somewhat imprecise phraseology of the pilots of N990FV might be a sign of a lack of familiarity with taxiing on the airport's north apron;- He did not anticipate that the light aircraft on final approach to grass runway 05 in the direction of the hot spot mentioned in the AIP constituted a disturbing factor for the pilots of N990FV, leading them to stop at Gate Z;- When N990FV was taxiing to runway holding position CAT I Z, he did not check if his approximate instruction N990FV here right.. had been obeyed by the flight crew of N990FV.Although this lack of attention had no consequences as long as N990FV was the only aircraft moving on the north apron, it did, however, play a significant role in the evolution of the risk of collision when the aircraft was approaching concrete runway 05 which was in operation.The SUST analysed the human factors with respect to the tower controller:The ADC controller became aware of the runway incursion in an unexpected way: N990FV appeared and suddenly penetrated into traffic which he was monitoring, the speed of which he knew or was aware of. When launched on its take-off roll on the ground, in these circumstances EIN68N became his basis of reference in the convergence with N990FV. The ADC controller did not have time to evaluate and integrate the speed of the latter into the evolution of the conflict. Furthermore, the control tower is located almost opposite taxiway Z, which makes it difficult to evaluate the speeds of aircraft which are moving there. At the moment when the GND controller instructed N990FV to stop on the spot, the latter was moving at 9 kt.It was therefore obviously under the influence of surprise that the ADC controller reported the danger to the flight crew of EIN68N and spontaneously how to avoid it. At this time the intruder was slowing down at approximately 1 kt/s2, which meant that it would stop in approximately ten seconds. Strictly speaking, the initial reaction of the ADC controller should have been to instruct EIN68N to reject its take-off in order to reduce the kinetic energies in the event of a collision. However, the recording of the radiotelephone communications shows that the instruction given initially consisted of alerting EIN68N by the term "caution" and then to indicate proceed to the right to avoid the danger represented by the runway incursion traffic is interfering on runway.In his statement, the ADC controller expressed his concern about the risk of collision which an instruction to EIN68N to reject its take-off would involve.By indicating the danger, he in fact transferred, directly and without delaying it by an instruction, the decision to continue or reject the take-off to its commander; adding proceed to the right" is explained by the reflex action of wishing to avoid danger to the aircraft he was controlling.Actual taxi route (Graphics: SUST):The holding bay Z (Graphics: Google Earth):Detail Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):Map (Graphics: Google Earth):Excerpt of Aerodrome Chart (Graphics: AIP Switzerland):
An Easyjet Europe Airbus A320-200, registration OE-IJL performing flight U2-3764 from Lisbon (Portugal) to Paris Charles de Gaulle (France), was planning to depart from Lisbon's runway 21. During preflight calculations both pilots completed calculations for takeoff from intersection U5 (Takeoff Run Available (TORA): 2450 meters), subsequently recomputed the takeoff from intersection with taxiway S1 (TORA less than from U5), however, inadvertently selected position S, which in fact was taxiway S4 or full length of the runway (TORA 3805 meters). Without checking the TORA to be less than for taxiway U5 for this computation the crew accepted the calculation results for takeoff from U5 or S1. The aircraft subsequently lined runway 21 up at taxiway U5 and commenced takeoff, the commander felt the takeoff was "wrong", however, TOGA was not selected. The aircraft became airborne and crossed the end of the runway at 75 feet AGL and continued to Paris, where the aircraft landed without further incident.14 days earlier the same mistake had happened to an Easyjet crew, see Report: Easyjet A320 at Lisbon on Apr 24th 2019, takeoff with insufficient thrust.On Jan 16th 2020 the AAIB released their bulletin into both occurrences concluding:Both aircraft took off using incorrect performance data for the intersection used. In each case, a selection error was made in the EFB which led the crew to believe that they had calculated performance information for a departure from S1 when in fact they had selected the full length of the runway. In both cases, the procedural barrier of cross-checking the runway distance against the aerodrome ground chart failed to prevent to error. Human performance limitations mean it is difficult for pilots to recognise and react to reduced performance (acceleration) once the takeoff has begun, so robust adherence to procedures is a key defence against such incidents occurring.The AAIB analysed:During pre-flight preparation, both flight crew selected PSNSTMP in the EFB as the reference point for the takeoff performance calculation believing it to be where Taxiway S1 crossed Runway 21 whereas it was actually the reference point for the full length of the runway. The use of takeoff Positions gave rise to the situation where two points on Runway 21 could be construed by the crew as being Position S within the EFB performance software.The operators SOPs required the crew to crosscheck the takeoff distance shown in the EFB against the equivalent distance shown on the aerodrome ground chart, but this crosscheck did not capture the error. Consequently, a lower thrust setting than required was used for the takeoff from S1 because it had been calculated for the full length of the runway (which had an additional 1,395 m available). After lifting off, the aircraft passed the upwind end of the runway at 100 ft aal.Another aircraft from the same operator, although operating under a different AOC, had an identical serious incident 14 days later. In both cases the pilots were confused by the EFB intersection selections because they did not refer to taxiway names, and the selection PSNSTMP could be confused between two runway intersections, S1 or S4.The AAIB reported following safety actions were taken as result of the occurrences:As a result of these serious incidents the following safety action was taken:- The aircraft operator issued a notice to its flight crew clarifying the takeoff positions available on Runway 21 at Lisbon Airport.- A NOTAM was issued highlighting confusing runway holding point namingand reminding crews that Position S referred to the full length of Runway 21.- The aircraft operator issued a description of the events and their causes to its flight crew to raise awareness of the risks of using the wrong intersection and distance for takeoff.- The aircraft operator engaged with the aircraft manufacturer to reviewfuture developments that could offer extra protections against events suchas those covered in this report.- The airport authority undertook to rename taxiways so that Taxiway Sintersected the runway at only one point; S4 (full length).Ground movement chart (Graphics: AAIB):
An Easyjet Airbus A320-200, registration G-EZTD performing flight U2-2374 from Lisbon (Portugal) to London Luton,EN (UK) with 175 passengers and 6 crew, was planning to depart from Lisbon's runway 21.

A Malaysia Airlines Airbus A330-200, registration 9M-MTY performing flight MH-145 from Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) to Auckland (New Zealand), was accelerating for takeoff from Kuala Lumpur's runway 32R when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed, vacated the runway about 1100 meters/3700 feet down the runway and returned to the apron.Passengers reported the aircraft stopped just prior to rotation, throwing them forward in their seats. The captain subsequently announced instrument issues. The aircraft returned to the apron, several mechanics came on board attempting to repair the aircraft. After about 3 hours they were asked to disembark and return for the flight the following morning. The same aircraft was waiting for them the following morning and needed to reject takeoff another time, see Incident: Malaysia A332 at Kuala Lumpur on Jan 2nd 2020, rejected takeoff due to instrument issues.The airline apologized to the passengers stating the flight was re-timed twice due to an unexpected technical issue involving an aircraft system. The crew rejected takeoff at low speed. Hotel accommodation, transportatin and meals were provided to the passengers affected while some of the passengers could be rebooked onto other carriers.
A Malaysia Airlines Airbus A330-200, registration 9M-MTY performing flight MH-145D from Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) to Auckland (New Zealand) originally scheduled for Jan 1st 2020, was accelerating for takeoff from Kuala Lumpur's runway 32R when the crew rejected takeoff again at low speed due to the same issue the day before. The aircraft returned to the apron.Passengers reported the aircraft stopped just prior to rotation, throwing them forward in their seats. The captain subsequently announced instrument issues, see Incident: Malaysia A332 at Kuala Lumpur on Jan 1st 2020, rejected takeoff due to instrument issues. The aircraft returned to the apron, several mechanics came on board attempting to repair the aircraft. After about 3 hours they were asked to disembark and return for the flight the following morning. The same aircraft was waiting for them the following morning and needed to reject takeoff another time. The aircraft returned to the apron, mechanics again boarded the aircraft, however, this time the passengers refused to fly with the occurrence aircraft. After about one hour of exchange with airline officials the airline announced a replacement aircraft would take them to Auckland.A replacement Airbus A330-300 registration 9M-MTK departed about 5 hours later and reached Auckland with a delay of total 18 hours.The airline apologized to the passengers stating the flight was re-timed twice due to an unexpected technical issue involving an aircraft system. The crew rejected takeoff at low speed. Hotel accommodation, transportatin and meals were provided to the passengers affected while some of the passengers could be rebooked onto other carriers. A replacement aircraft finally took the passengers to Auckland.
A Lanhsa British Aerospace BAe Jetstream 3100, registration HR-AXG performing flight LNH-2 from Roatan to La Ceiba (Honduras), was accelerating for takeoff from Roatan's runway 07 just above V1 when a large vulture impacted the aircraft's nose. The crew continued takeoff and the flight for a safe landing in La Ceiba, located about 40nm southsoutheast of Roatan, about 20 minutes later.The "shortened" aircraft:
A Jazz de Havilland Dash 8-300, registration C-FSOU performing flight QK-8684 from Montreal,QC to Bagotville,QC (Canada) with 49 passengers and 3 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Montreal's runway 24L just prior to rotation when the inboard left main wheel began to glow orange. Upon rotation the wheel separated from the gear strut and fell back onto the runway. The crew continued the initial climb, stopped at 3000 feet and entered a hold to burn off fuel. The aircraft returned for a safe landing on runway 24R about 95 minutes after departure.https://flightaware.com/live/flight/JZA684/history/20200103/1835Z/CYUL/CYBGAbout to rotate:Wheel separating:
A CommutAir Embraer ERJ-145 on behalf of United, registration N13161 performing flight UA-4987 from Portland,ME to Newark,NJ (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Portland's runway 11 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed, vacated the runway and stopped clear of the runway reporting, they had a lot of de-ice fluid and smoke on the flight deck, it was brief but thick enough they didn't want to continue. The aircraft returned to the apron.A passenger reported the captain announced they had fumes/smoke in the cockpit, they believed due to excess of de-icing fluid in the engines. The runway conditions would have been good despite the heavy snow fall at the time.The aircraft, that had been delayed by about 6 hours for departure already, remained on the ground for 16 hours, then departed again for the flight and reached Newark with a delay of 22 hours.
An Easyjet Airbus A319-100, registration G-EZMK performing flight U2-8552 from Murcia,SP (Spain) to London Gatwick,EN (UK) with 124 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Murcia's runway 23L when both engines ingested a number of birds. The crew heard loud noise and observed high vibrations for both engines. The speed was below V1, hence the crew rejected takeoff and brought the aircraft to a safe stop on the runway. The engines were shut down.The airport reported the aircraft had already entered the runway but had not yet commenced takeoff when the crew reported a right hand engine fire indication after a number of sea gulls had been ingested.The airline reported the passengers disembarked normally and returned to the terminal.Spain's CIAIAC have opened an investigation into the occurrence.A replacement A320-200 registration G-EZWV reached London with a delay of 5 hours.On Apr 5th 2018 the CIAIAC reported the aircraft was accelerating for takeoff when both engines ingested birds causing high vibrations. The crew rejected takeoff below V1 and stopped on the runway. The aircraft sustained substantial damage limited to the engines. The aircraft was towed off the runway about 90 minutes after the rejected takeoff. The occurrence was rated an accident and is being investigated by the CIAIAC.In December 2019 the CIAIAC reported a final report has been approved, however, "taking into account the characteristics of the treatment of information in the military field and the obligations of information to the parties in the civil field, it has been agreed that the publication and public dissemination of the Final Report be restricted."
A United Boeing 737-900, registration N28478 performing flight UA-588 from Tampa,FL to Chicago O'Hare,IL (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Tampa's runway 01R when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (65 knots over ground) reporting a "door light". The aircraft returned to the apron.A passenger reported the crew announced a door sensor issue.Maintenance checked the aircraft, identified and rectified a sensor issue, and returned the aircraft to service.The aircraft departed again about 4 hours after the rejected takeoff and reached Chicago with a delay of 3.5 hours.
A Delta Airlines Boeing 717-200, registration N982AT performing flight DL-1250 from Huntsville,AL to Atlanta,GA (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Huntsville's runway 36L when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed reporting they did not have any mechanical problems and were vacating the runway. The aircraft returned to the apron.A passenger reported the captain announced they had received a takeoff configuration warning. The aircraft stopped on taxiway while running the checklists then returned to the apron.The aircraft was able to depart about 3:45 hours after the rejected takeoff and reached Atlanta with a delay of 3:20 hours.
An Ethiopian Airlines de Havilland Dash 8-400, registration ET-ANY performing flight ET-212 from Dire Dawa to Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) with 74 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Dire Dawa's runway 33 in night conditions when a number of, at least 5, wild boar crossed the runway. The crew rejected takeoff, lost directional control, the aircraft went off the runway and came to a stop on soft ground. There were no injuries, the aircraft received substantial damage beyond repair. The Aviation Herald learned of this occurrence on Dec 10th 2019 (and needed until Dec 11th 2019 to cross check and verify the occurrence) while discussing hull losses of Ethiopian Airlines with Captain Bernd Kai von Hoesslin TRI B737/Ret. (former B738 and B38M Captain for Ethiopian Airlines having left the company in April 2019, who asked specifically to be identified as source) following the accident in Juba, see Accident: Ethiopian DH8D at Juba on Dec 10th 2019, overran runway on takeoff. Capt. Hoesslin told The Aviation Herald that just this summer 2019 the aircraft ET-ANY had been dismantled. Both engines had been damaged beyond repair in addition to substantial fuselage damage, which prompted the airframe to be written off. The airframe was sold to be parted out. Following the accident all night flights into or out of unfenced airports were halted.The airline at the time had released a press release stating the crew faced a runway incursion by wild animals during their takeoff roll and aborted takeoff. All 74 passengers and 6 crew safely deplaned.IATA summarized the occurrence in a safety brief: "Directional control was lost during the take-off roll and the aircraft ran off the side of the runway"A local newspaper reported on Oct 26th 2016, that three hippos were killed as result of the accident, two were known to have survived. The aircraft received substantial damage including the separation of the nose gear. An accident investigation was opened by Ethiopia's Civil Aviation Authority (however, no final report has surfaced to date including the ICAO e-library). The airport's perimeter fence needed to be strenghtened according to the local airport authority, who pledged to engage in strenghtening the fence following the accident.On Dec 12th 2019 The Aviation Herald received official information, that the animals crossing the runway were wild boar, not hippos as indicated by local sources in 2016. The right main gear collapsed as result of collision with the animals. The aircraft was considered a hull loss.
An Ethiopian Airlines de Havilland Dash 8-400, registration ET-AQC performing flight ET-357 from Juba (South Sudan) to Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) with 21 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Juba's runway 31 at about 17:30L (14:30Z) but overran the end of the runway before coming to a stop on soft ground. No injuries are being reported, the aircraft sustained substantial damage. The damage includes the collpase of the left main gear, left engine damage, left propeller blades broken and debris of the left propeller puncturing the fuselage and pressure vessel.Juba Airport reported the aircraft was departing Juba for Addis Ababa when it went off the runway, all 21 people on board are safe, there were no injuries. The passengers are going to be rebooked onto the following day (Wednesday).Captain Bernd Kai von Hoesslin TRI B737/Ret. (former B738 and B38M Captain for Ethiopian Airlines having left the company in April 2019, who asked specifically to be identified as source) reported the left hand propeller blades fractured, impacted and punctured the fuselage.Ethiopian Airlines announced flight ET-357 from Juba to Addis Ababa, a Dash 8-400 ET-AQC, had an incident at Juba Airport when the aircraft skidded to the side of the runway during takeoff roll. All passengers and crew disembarked safely and are going to be accomodated on the next available flight. The weather was windy and rainy. No METARs are available, heavy rain was reported at the time of the takeoff.The aircraft seen off the runway (Photo: Kenyan Aviator):The aircraft seen off the runway (Photos: Robert Alai):The punctured fuselage:
A Qantas Airbus A330-200, registration VH-EBF performing flight QF-119 from Brisbane,QL (Australia) to Auckland (New Zealand), was accelerating for takeoff from Brisbane's runway 19 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 30 knots over ground) and stopped. Tower cancelled the takeoff clearance and instructed the crew to taxi forward and vacate the runway at the next exit A3. The aircraft vacated the runway and returned to the apron.The aircraft remained on the ground for about 3 hours, then departed and reached Auckland with a delay of 3 hours.A passenger reported the crew initially attempted to solve the problem via checklists while holding on a taxiway, then the aircraft returned to the gate. Passengers were told the delay would be short as the electrical issue would be an easy fix. It appeared the electrical issue was related to the air conditioning, while several attempts to fix the problem failed cabin temperature rose, the ambient temperature outside was 30 degrees Celsius. After about 3 hours the aircraft finally departed.
A British Airways Airbus A380-800, registration G-XLEG performing flight BA-11 from London Heathrow,EN (UK) to Singapore (Singapore), was accelerating for takeoff from Heathrow's runway 27L when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed. The aircraft stopped on the runway for about 5 minutes, then vacated the runway and stopped again on the parallel taxiway. About 30 minutes after the rejected takeoff the aircraft taxied to the holding point, departed and reached Singapore without further incident.A passenger reported the captain announced after vacating the runway that they had received a nose wheel steering indication and had recovered nose wheel steering. Later he announced that they had reset the computer in consultation with maintenance. The aircraft subsequently performed the flight without any further incident.
An Air France Airbus A340-300, registration F-GLZO performing flight AF-681 from Bogota (Colombia) to Paris Charles de Gaulle (France) with 219 passengers and 10 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Bogota's runway 13R, before the takeoff roll the runway anemometer showed winds from 211 degrees at 1 knots. During the takeoff roll the winds changed to a head wind component of about 13 knots. At 138 KIAS the captain began to rotate the aircraft for takeoff, when the winds changed to a tail wind component of 12 knots, the IAS reduced by 6 knots. The aircraft became airborne, after lift off the winds further changed to a 25 knots tail wind component and a downdraft component of 4 knots, while the IAS reduced to 128 KIAS. Six seconds after the main gear left the ground a windshear aural warning occurred three times, a red WINDSHEAR warning from the FMGEC was displayed on the primary flight displays for 15 seconds. The captain held the pitch attitude between 11 and 13 degrees, the aircraft remained stabled at 5 feet AGL, the captain increased nose up inputs until Alpha Prot activated for 4 seconds. The tailwind component then began to decrease, the IAS began to increase and the aircraft began to climb again crossing the runway end at 58 feet AGL and the subsequent climb profile had the aircraft pass all obstacles with sufficient margin. 21 seconds after becoming airborne the windshear warning stopped at 193 feet AGL, a pitch of 13 degrees nose up. 5 seconds later, at 258 feet AGL, the IAS increased through 145 KIAS, which had been computed as V2. The aircraft climbed without further incident, the crew reported the windshear to ATC (this report prompted the next crew to wait for 3 minutes before commencing their takeoff) and continued to Paris without further incident.The BEA released their final report, however, did not release a formal conclusion of their investigation report but following lessons learned from the occurrence:Management of risk of windshear at take-off: prevention-oriented strategyWindshear, a headwind component changing to a tailwind component, associated with a downdraft wind gradient, as was the case in the event, results in a reduction in the air speed and lift. When such a phenomenon occurs shortly before or shortly after the rotation, the associated risks are the loss of control or collision with obstacles.During this event, once the aeroplane had entered the windshear, as the thrust was already set to TOGA, the crew had little means available to them to restore safety margins and could only act on the aeroplanes pitch to prevent both stalling and collision with the ground or obstacles. In this case, the flight envelope protections, notably in angle of attack, leave the crew the possibility of applying a stick input up to full nose up deflection if necessary (refer to the procedure described in section 2.6).The possible actions to limit the risks identified above therefore mainly take place before the aeroplane enters the windshear.Assessment of windshear risk at Bogotá El Dorado airportThere are no statistics produced by the local authorities on the number of windshear occurrences per year at Bogotá El Dorado airport. At this airport, take-offs by long-haul aeroplanes often occur at the performance limit which may compound the consequences of a windshear at take-off. In addition, this airport is not equipped with equipment to detect these phenomena which are associated with multiple risks as described above. A statistical study of the windshear at Bogotá El Dorado airport would make it possible to decide if means are to be implemented to limit these risks.Consequently, the BEA recommends that:- the Civil Aviation Authority of Colombia (Unidad Administrativa Especial de Aeronáutica Civil) assess the number of windshears per year at Bogotá El Dorado airport, their strength and the conditions conducive to their appearance. [Recommendation FRAN 2019-035]€- the Civil Aviation Authority of Colombia assess, according to the results of the abovementioned study, the relevance of equipping Bogotá El Dorado airport with systems designed to detect these phenomena and warn the air traffic control of them. [Recommendation FRAN 2019-0036]Wind data provided to crews by air traffic controlThe crews flight file did not contain any message indicating the presence of windshear. In addition, the Predictive Warning System (PWS) did not detect the windshear despite its strength, its location on the aeroplanes axis and the presence of rainfall. The crew therefore mainly relied on the information transmitted by the air traffic controllers for assessing the risk at the time of take-off.The controllers had wind data at the four runway thresholds but did not give this to the crew in the take-off clearance. More generally, this information is not systematically communicated. The investigation showed that this data, indicating a continuing difference in wind speed and direction between thresholds 13 and thresholds 31, at the time of the event, was the only data which could have warned of a windshear risk.Following this serious incident, Air France issued an operational directive with a COMPANY NOTAM requiring crews to ask the controller for the wind at the two thresholds of the runway used and to take into account the most unfavourable wind before take-off. This NOTAM was inserted in all the flight files to Bogotá on 25 August 2017, six days after the serious incident. In addition, the Air France crews now have the wind measured at the four runway thresholds in the cockpit via their PILOTPAD. This data could benefit all the operators operating at this airport.Consequently, the BEA recommends that:€- the Civil Aviation Authority of Colombia (Unidad Administrativa Especial de Aeronáutica Civil) ensure that a procedure is set up by the Bogotá air traffic control unit with the aim of supplying crews, in the take-off clearances, with the wind measured at the two thresholds of the runway in service when the weather situation is such that windshear is likely (in particular in the presence of storms, towering cumulus or cumulonimbus close to the airport) and that the Bogotá airport aeronautical information warns operators of the risk associated with these particular situations. [Recommendation FRAN 2019-037]Communication language with air traffic controlDuring the event, only the exchanges between the air traffic control and the crew of the Air France flight were in English, all the others were in Spanish. The ontroller asked Spanishspeaking crews several times for information on the weather situation encountered during the take-off.Likewise, the controller cleared several crews for take-off shortly before the Air France flight and gave them the latest wind information each time. This information, transmitted in Spanish, could have been of interest to the crew of this serious incident.Even if these exchanges did not mention the presence of windshear, the crew of the Air France flight did not have access to the information exchanged with the air traffic controller about the weather situation and the sequencing of the departures, which limited the crews situational awareness.

A BoA Boliviana de Aviacion Boeing 737-300, registration CP-3020 performing flight OB-552 from Santa Cruz to Tarija (Bolivia), suffered an incident, so far it remains unclear whether on departure leading to a rejected takeoff or already airborne.Bolivia's Media reported at the time citing an "inofficial source" that the control column began to severly vibrate on a flight from Santa Cruz to Tarija. The aircraft , CP-3020 was taken out of service as result. The media speculated on the base of this source, that the aircraft might never fly again (which proved incorrect, the aircraft returned to service).Bolivia's DGAC, although listing other BoA incidents e.g. involving CP-3020 on Mar 7th 2019, see Incident: BoA B733 at La Paz on Mar 7th 2019, fracture of left shimmy damper on landing or CP-3077 on Mar 8th 2019, see Accident: BoA B733 at La Paz on Aug 3rd 2019, main wheels rotate in relation to gear strut, never listed this occurrence, only the occurrence of a light aircraft (PA-32) is being listed by the DGAC Bolivia on Mar 24th 2019.However, on Dec 2nd 2019 the US NTSB reported an incident happened at Santa Cruz on Mar 24th 2019 involving a Boeing 737, Bolivia's AIG is investigating the occurrence. The NTSB joined the investigation representing the state of manufacture of the aircraft.
An Air Canada Rouge Airbus A319-100, registration C-FYKW performing flight RV-1897 from Las Vegas,NV to Vancouver,BC (Canada) with 131 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Las Vegas' runway 26R, no delay, when the crew rejected takeoff at about 80 knots after receiving a hot brakes ECAM message. The aircraft slowed safely and stopped on the runway, the crew worked the related checklists, assessed the situation and taxied to the apron.The Canadian TSB reported the brakes temperatures were observed at 750 degrees C immediately after the rejected takeoff. The fuse plugs of the right hand main tyres melted, the tyres deflated. The right hand inboard and outboard wheel brakes and tyres were replaced, the wheel axels were inspected. The overheat and after emergency brake inspections were carried out, the brakes system tested with no faults found and the aircraft returned to service.The aircraft returned to service about 16 hours after the rejected takeoff.
A Rossiya Airbus A320-200, registration VQ-BCG performing flight FV-6635 from St. Petersburg (Russia) to Paris Charles de Gaulle (France), was accelerating for takeoff from Pulkovo Airport's runway 28R when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed due to the right hand engine (CFM56) ingesting birds. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.Russia's Rosaviatsia reported the right hand engine received damage due to the inefficiency of ornithological support for flights. A number of safety recommendations were released to the airport to improve wildlife management.
A Cargojet Airways Boeing 767-300, registration C-GCIJ performing freight flight W8-262 from Winnipeg,MB to Iqaluit,NU (Candada) with 2 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Winnipeg's runway 36 when the crew received a red FLAP EICAS message and aural warning prompting the crew to reject takeoff at high speed already above V1. The aircraft came to a stop still on the runway and vacated the runway at the last exit. Emergency services were called to check and monitor the hot brakes and subsequently escorted the aircraft to the apron.The Canadian TSB reported maintenance found the flaps stuck at position 1 unable to retract. Water was found inside the Flap/Stabilizer Position Module (FSPM) cards, the cards were dried and FSPM M838 replaced. Subsequent tests confirmed normal operation.
A United Airbus A319-100, registration N818UA performing flight UA-1184 from Vancouver,BC (Canada) to Denver,CO (USA) with 121 passengers and 5 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Vancouver's runway 08R when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed reporting birds on the nose. The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway near the end onto taxiway D05. The crew requested emergency services to inspect their left hand brakes and reported it was a rather large bird, a crane or the like. The runway was closed for a runway inspection. Emergency services sprayed the brakes.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground 23 hours after the rejected takeoff.On Nov 13th 2019 the Canadian TSB reported a blue heron hit the aircraft near the right hand engine area. The crew rejected takeoff, vacated the runway onto taxiway D, stopped and requested emergency services. Emergency services sprayed the landing gear with foam due to reported high brakes temperatures. The passengers and flight attendants deplaned via air stairs and were bussed to the terminal. Maintenance cleaned the right engine cowl and pylon, no damage was found. The main landing gear fuse plugs melted as per design due to the hot brakes as result of high energy reject, the tyres deflated. All 4 main landing gear brakes and wheels were replaced.
An Air Canada Rouge Airbus A320-200 on behalf of Air Canada, registration C-GKOE performing flight AC-782 from Los Angeles,CA (USA) to Montreal,QC (Canada) with 139 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Los Angeles' runway 25R when fumes and smoke developed in the cabin. Cabin crew reported the observation to the flight deck after the aircraft rotated, the flight crew donned their oxygen masks, stopped the climb at 5000 feet for a return to Los Angeles. Working the related checklists the odour and smoke dissipated. The aircraft landed safely back on Los Angeles' runway 25L about 14 minutes after departure. Emergency services checked the outside of the aircraft before the aircraft taxied to the apron.The Canadia TSB reported two cabin air re-circulation filters were replaced, both engines (CFM56) received a compressor wash.https://flightaware.com/live/flight/ACA782/history/20191105/1625Z/KLAX/CYUL
A Safair Boeing 737-400, registration ZS-OAF performing flight FA-421 from Durban to Port Elizabeth (South Africa), was climbing out of Durban's runway 24 when the right hand engine (CFM56) ingested a bird during rotation for takeoff causing the engine to vibrate. The crew continued takeoff, climbed the aircraft to FL100 and returned to Durban for a safe landing on runway 24 about 25 minutes after departure.The aircraft remained on the ground in Durban for about 8 hours, then positioned to Johannesburg (South Africa) and remained on the ground in Johannesburg for about 33 hours before returning to service.
A White Avions de Transport Regional ATR-72-212A on behalf of TAP Air Portugal, registration CS-DJC performing flight TP-1063 from Bilbao,SP (Spain) to Lisbon (Portugal) with 70 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Bilbao's runway 30 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 125 knots over ground) due to a red-winged eagle colliding with the aircraft and a propeller. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron, the carcass of the eagle was recovered from the runway.The aircraft remained on the ground for about 19 hours, then positioned back to Lisbon.
A Laudamotion Airbus A320-200, registration OE-LMB performing flight OE-2169 from Fuerteventura,CI (Spain) to Vienna (Austria) with 160 passengers, was accelerating for takeoff from Fuerteventura's runway 01 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed and returned to the apron.A passenger reported that there was nothing unuusal until the brakes came on at relatively low speed, no unusual sounds, no unusual smells, no unusual vibrations. After the aircraft returned to the apron, a technician came on board and went straight to the cockpit and sat in the captain's seat. Soon after some noise was heard from below the cabin, obviously the maintenance folks triggered something mechanical, an odour developed on board. Obviously all attempts were unsuccessful, the crew announced, the flight would be postponed to the next day. The following day a Ryanair Boeing 737 was dispatched from Palma Mallorca, which took them to Vienna.The airline reported the board computers showed a fault message at low speed prompting the crew to reject takeoff as a precaution. The issue could not immediately be solved on site, the passengers therefore were rebooked onto a replacement flight the following day and taken to hotels in Fuerteventura while waiting for the replacement flight. The issue was diagnosed as an indication problem of the board computer, technicians are still working the solve the issue.A replacement Ryanair Boeing 737-800 registration EI-ENA reached Vienna with a delay of 26.5 hours.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Fuerteventura about 46 hours after the rejected takeoff.
An Omni Air International Boeing 767-300, registration N351AX performing flight OY-5396 from Shannon (Ireland) to an unknown destination, was accelerating for takeoff from runway 06 when the crew rejected takeoff and advised they needed to return to the apron due to a maintenance problem. Tower queried "an engine issue" which the crew affirmed.The aircraft is still on the ground about 8 hours later.The aircraft had been in Shannon for maintenance since Oct 24th 2019 and had undergone engine test runs earlier the day.The aircraft turning off the runway (Photo: AVH/PF):
A Thai Airways Boeing 777-300, registration HS-TKL performing flight TG-970 from Bangkok (Thailand) to Zurich (Switzerland) with 339 passengers and 20 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Bangkok's runway 01L when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 55 knots over ground) due to the failure of the left hand engine (GE90). The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron. The left engine shows a large hole at the inboard casing.The airline reported the aircraft was taking off from Bangkok when the left hand engine failed prompting the crew to reject takeoff. It was found the aircraft needs repair, no spare aircraft was immediately available, hence the passengers were taken to hotels. A replacement aircraft departed later the day.A replacement Boeing 777-300 registration HS-TKK reached Zurich with a delay of 12 hours.Late Oct 23rd 2019 the FAA released Emergency Airworthiness directive EAD-2019-21-51 stating the EAD was prompted by "by an event that occurred on October 20, 2019, in which a Boeing Model 777-300ER airplane powered by GE GE90-115B model turbofan engines experienced an uncontained high-pressure turbine (HPT) failure that resulted in an aborted takeoff. Debris impacted the aircraft fuselage and the other engine. Uncontained HPT failure, if not addressed, could result in release of high-energy debris, damage to the engine, damage to the airplane, and possible loss of the airplane." The EAD requires operators of GE90-115B engines with certain engine serial numbers to remove from service the Interstage Seal, part number 2505M72P01 with serial numbers GWN0TCL3, NCE062LD, NCE254LC, NCE314KU, NCE374LB, NCE527KT, NCE777LD, or NCE994KW within 25 cycles based on the GE Alert Service Bulletin GE90-100 S/B 72-A0826, dated October 23, 2019.Passenger Video following the big bang (Video: Aerotelegraph):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgDrkpTGsTMThe damaged engine:
A Xiamen Boeing 737-800, registration B-5658 performing flight MF-8395 from Qingdao to Changsha (China), was rotating for takeoff when the stick shaker activated as soon as the nose gear became airborne, an airspeed inconsistency indication activated. The crew declared PAN PAN and continued the climb, identified the airspeeds had become unreliable and were able to stop the stick shaker about 66 seconds after it activated identifying the right hand airspeed was unreliable. The crew considered the weather in Qingdao, which was not favourable for a return, and decided to continue to Changsa, where the aircraft landed safely.A post flight inspection revealed the right hand pitot tube (dynamic port) had ingested an insect during the rotation, the pitot heating had burnt the insect to ashes which blocked the tube.The crew reported this had been the longest minute of their lives, with their experience, good habits and crew resource management they were able to cross check the airspeeds and identify the right hand airspeed had become faulty.
A Delta Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-88, registration N974DL performing flight DL-1983 from Savannah,GA to Atlanta,GA (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from runway 10 when the crew rejected takeoff due to an engine failure (JT8D). The aircraft slowed safely.The FAA reported the aircraft aborted takeoff due to an engine failure, it appeared debris came loose setting the grass on fire. The damage is unknown, the occurrence was rated an incident.The occurrence aircraft returned to service after about 17 hours on the ground at Savannah.
A Gulf Air Airbus A320-200N, registration A9C-TD performing flight GF-751 from Karachi (Pakistan) to Bahrain (Bahrain), was accelerating for takeoff from Karachi's runway 25L when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed due to a bird strike and vacated the runway about 1500 meters/5000 feet down the runway. The aircraft returned to the apron.The aircraft was able to depart about 4 hours after the rejected takeoff and reached Bahrain with a delay of 3:40 hours.
An Air Malta Airbus A320-200, registration 9H-AEP performing flight KM-662 from Malta (Malta) to Palermo (Italy), was accelerating for takeoff from Malta's runway 31 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed due to an engine (CFM56) ingesting a bird. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The airline reported the rotation to Palermo was cancelled. The engine received considerable damage.
An Air Greenland de Havilland Dash 8-200, registration OY-GRJ performing flight GL-548 from Nuuk to Kangerlussuaq (Greenland) with 29 passengers and 3 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Nuuk's runway 05 when the crew rejected takeoff above Vr due to the aircraft not rotating despite full back pressure on the yoke. The aircraft slowed safely and stopped about 50 meters short of the end of the runway.The Danish Havarikommissionen (HCL) released their final report concluding the probable cause of the serious incident was:Actual masses above standard masses on crew, passengers and carry-on hand baggage led to a CG forward of the operational aircraft CG limitations causing reduced aircraft rotation ability during the take-off roll.The HCL summarized:Pre-flight mass and balance calculations using standard masses on crew, passengers, and carry-on hand baggage documented a Center of Gravity (CG) within aircraft CG limitations.Post-flight mass and balance calculations using actual masses on crew, passengers and carry-on hand baggage documented a CG forward of the operational aircraft CG limitation.The HCL described the sequence of events:Before the flight and in order to mitigate a forward center of gravity issue, an off duty crewmember moved from the cockpit jump seat to a passenger seat.Nuuk Aerodrome Flight Information Service (AFIS) reported runway 05 in use, wind conditions to be 330° and 5 knots, QNH 1014, and a temperature of 10° Celsius.Runway conditions were dry, and the visibility was more than 10 kilometers (km).There were no remarks to the aircraft pre-flight checks.The commander was the pilot monitoring, and the first officer was the pilot flying.Before engine start, the first officer made a departure briefing including information on aircraft takeoff configuration (a flap setting of 15°), a V1 (decision speed) equal to VR (rotation speed) of 88 knots, and a review of the aborted take-off procedure.After engine start, Nuuk AFIS reported no traffic on the runway and the wind conditions to be 330° and 3 knots.The aircraft taxied to take-off position on runway 05.The flight crew completed the before take-off checklist (including a check of aircraft flight controls) without remarks.The first officer initiated the take-off roll.During the take-off roll, the commander called Sixty (airspeed), and the first officer confirmed.At approximately 80 knots, the commander called Vee-One-Rotate.The first officer applied normal backpressure to the elevator control but experienced no positive responsive feedback (aircraft rotation) and consequentially applied full aft backpressure to the elevator control.The first officer received no positive responsive feedback (aircraft rotation), and considered the lack of aircraft rotation to be a result of a flight control failure and aborted the take-off by retarding the power levers to DISC position and applying maximum anti-skid braking.The aircraft came to a full stop approximately 50 meters before the end of runway 05.The flight crew discussed different scenarios and agreed that the sequence of events did not prevent them from making a safe taxi back to the apron.While taxiing back to the apron, the flight crew requested an external visual inspection of potential hot wheel brakes, and the commander briefed the passengers.The HCL analysed:Prior to the take-off roll, the flight crew experienced no precursors of the upcoming sequence of events.During the take-off roll and at approximately 80 knots, the commander called Vee-One-Rotate leading the first officer to apply backpressure to the elevator control.The pitot static test revealed a 3 knot higher airspeed indication than the actual airspeed (however within AMM limitations).The 3 knot higher airspeed indication in combination with the premature commander callout most likely prolonged the first officers time perception of no positive responsive feedback resulting in a sooner decision on aborting the take-off roll. These findings might have been causal but were not the root cause.Even though, the aircraft accelerated to an airspeed above VR (88 knots), and the first officer applied full backpressure to the elevator control, the control input only generated a minor increase in pitch attitude.For that reason, the rationale behind the decision on aborting the take-off roll complied with the operating procedures and potentially prevented a more severe outcome.Mass and Balance:Before departure, the flight crew were aware of a forward CG issue leading to a repositioning of an off-duty crewmember from the cockpit to the cabin.The mass and balance calculations, based on standard masses, prepared by the flight crew before the flight and subsequently by the AIB resulted in a CG within aircraft CG limitations.The mass and balance calculation, based on actual masses (an increase of masses compared to standard masses of approximately 13% on crew, wardrobe, passengers and carry-on hand baggage), prepared by the AIB resulted in a CG 2.4 inches forward of and outside aircraft operational CG limitations.To the AIB, actual masses above standard masses resulted in the CG being forward of and outside aircraft operational CG limitations and was the root cause to reduced aircraft rotation ability.Operating procedures, which complied with Regulation (EU) 965/2012 on air operations, stipulated ground handling and cabin crewmembers to notify the commander when observing significant number of passengers whose masses, including carry-on hand baggage, are expected to exceed the standard passenger masses.

A Lufthansa Airbus A340-300, registration D-AIGO performing flight LH-780 from Frankfurt/Main (Germany) to Nanjing (China), was lined up and waiting for takeoff from Frankfurt's runway 25C.A Lufthansa Cityline Canadair CRJ-900, registration D-ACND performing flight LH-1015 from Brussels (Belgium) to Frankfurt/Main (Germany), was on final approach to Frankfurt's runway 25R. While LH-1015 was still on final approach tower cleared LH-780 for takeoff, the A340 commenced their takeoff roll. The crew of the CRJ however initiated a go around. After the crew reported the go around, Tower immediately restricted the climb of the CRJ to 2000 feet and instructed a right hand turn, LH-780 was instructed to turn left. The crew of LH-780 reported they had a TCAS warning now in a left hand turn at about 2400 feet. After the developing conflict was resolved, the CRJ crew reported they had the A340 always on their TCAS and in sight, there wasn't any issue, they had to go around, descending through 300 feet they couldn't hold the aircraft, it was nearly uncontrollable. The CRJ crew reported on downwind that they had received a TCAS resolution advisory for a very short period of time.The A340 continued to Nanjing for a safe landing, the CRJ positioned for another approach land landed safely on runway 25R about 15 minutes after the go around. ATC explained to other traffic that the LH-780 had turned right, they detected/recognized the go around very late, that's why it got very tight, otherwise they could have separated them better.According to the noise monitor of Frankfurt Airport both aircraft came as close as 50 feet vertical and 900 meters/0.49nm lateral separation at 18:40L (16:40Z). LH-780 started a left turn immediately afterwards and LH-1015 entered a right turn.Standard Departures out of runways 25C and 25L provide for right hand turns, in some cases for left hand turns after becoming airborne.Germany's BFU rated the occurrence an incident and have not opened an investigation into the occurrence.Metars:EDDF 131820Z 15004KT 100V180 9999 FEW030CB SCT044 20/14 Q1017 BECMG 32006KT=EDDF 131750Z VRB02KT 9999 FEW030CB 21/13 Q1017 BECMG 32006KT=EDDF 131720Z VRB05KT 9999 VCSH FEW030CB 21/13 Q1016 BECMG 32006KT=EDDF 131650Z 01013KT 9999 -SHRA FEW020 SCT030CB 22/14 Q1016 TEMPO SHRA=EDDF 131620Z 23007KT 9999 VCSH FEW015 FEW025CB 21/15 Q1016 TEMPO SHRA=EDDF 131550Z 25009KT 220V280 9999 VCSH FEW015 FEW025CB 20/15 Q1017 NOSIG=EDDF 131520Z 26008KT 230V290 9999 VCSH FEW022CB 20/15 Q1017 NOSIG=EDDF 131450Z 23008KT 200V260 9999 VCSH FEW020CB 19/15 Q1017 NOSIG=EDDF 131420Z 22007KT 9999 VCSH FEW020CB 18/16 Q1017 NOSIG=EDDF 131350Z 25006KT 9999 -SHRA FEW015 FEW019CB 18/16 Q1017 RESHRA NOSIG=COR EDDF 131320Z 30010KT 280V340 9999 SHRA FEW015 SCT019CB 18/15 Q1017 BECMG NSW=Both aircraft at closest approximation (Graphics: Fraport Noise Monitor):Standard Departure Foxtrott runways 25C and 25L (Graphics: AIP Germany):
A Norwegian Air International Boeing 737-800, registration EI-FHZ performing flight D8-5322 from Alicante,SP (Spain) to Oslo (Norway) with 175 passengers and 6 crew, had been cleared for takeoff from Alicante's runway 10 and was accelerating for takeoff, when tower cancelled the takeoff clearance due to vehicles on the runway. The crew rejected takeoff at low speed and vacated the runway via the first high speed turn off about 1500 meters/5000 feet down the runway. The aircraft returned to the holding point runway 10 and departed about 6 minutes later. Spain's CIAIAC reported Alicante's tower had cleared two vehicles to enter runway 10 at the end for a runway inspection. About 4 minutes later the controller cleared the Boeing for takeoff. The vehicle drivers, who were listening to the tower frequency, reported immediately they were still on the runway, which prompted the controller to instruct the Boeing to stop. The crew rejected takeoff and vacated via a taxiway. The occurrence is being investigated by the CIAIAC.On Jul 17th 2019 the CIAIAC released their final report reporting the probable cause of the incident was:The incident occurred because aircraft IBK2WH was issued an incorrect takeoff clearance by the tower when the runway was occupied by two runway and apron service vehicles that had previously been cleared to enter the runway.The following contributed to the incident:- The possible excessive workload for a student controller.- The single-position configuration in the tower.- The lack of effective supervision by the instructor at the time of the incident.- The use of Spanish to communicate with the SPP vehicles, which prevented the crew of the aircraft from understanding their content.The CIAIAC summarized the event:At the time of the incident, with one control position staffed in the control tower, there was a student controller in training and an instructor.Four minutes earlier, at 16:26, the control tower had cleared two runway and apron service (SPP in Spanish) vehicles to check the runway. These vehicles were on the runway at the time of the takeoff. The takeoff clearance given to the aircraft was heard by the SPP vehicles, which immediately cleared the runway and informed the tower of the situation. The controller instructed the aircraft to reject its takeoff. The vehicles exited the runway without further incident. The aircraft stopped its takeoff run and also exited the runway without further incident.The investigation has determined that the distance between the aircraft and the two vehicles was in excess of 1000 m throughout the event.The CIAIAC annotated that at the time of the takeoff clearance the frequency had been busy for 70.1% of time during which the controller handled:- Coordination with an SPP car to reposition EZY34RE.- 1 taxi clearance for EZY34RE.- 1 clearance issued to last departing traffic (IBK5302), which was still outstanding.- 1 proactive clearance issued proactively (that is, with no call made by the crew) to a departing aircraft (EZY45DR).- 1 clearance request for a new departing aircraft (RYR761Y9), which he tells to stand by.- Information to AFL2523 that its CTOT is 16:43.- 1 line up and wait clearance for IBK5358.- 1 takeoff clearance for IBK2WHFollowing the rejected takeoff the aircraft vacated the runway via taxiway C2 about 1600 meters/5200 feet down the runway. The crew acknowledged the reject takeoff instruction as the aircraft was accelerating through 80 knots over ground, the maximum speed reached was 88 knots over ground.The CIAIAC analysed:The interaction between the SPP vehicles and ATC, as just another operator, was correct. The communication procedure employed with ATC was appropriate. They communicated their position at all times, reported their intentions and acknowledged the instructions issued by ATC. In fact, when they were unable to acknowledge their instruction to enter the runway at the 28 threshold, they stayed where they were. Their positions during the entire incident were known to ATC and were correctly annotated by the controller on the strip.The practice by both drivers when picking up objects from the runway of driving as close as possible so as not to have to get out of and move away from the car, allowed the drivers to monitor the tower frequency constantly. When the aircraft was cleared to take off, PAPA6 was picking up some debris, but this did not prevent the driver from monitoring the tower frequency. The active listening by the drivers at all times while driving the SPP vehicles allowed them to identify the conflict and provided a barrier that kept the incident from becoming worse. Considering the speed and acceleration of an aircraft of these characteristics, which is airborne in 37 s (as the second takeoff showed), a delay in identifying the conflict may not have allowed the vehicles to vacate the runway on time.Both drivers, the COAM and the TOAM, immediately detected the conflict. Their reaction was immediate and similar: to vacate the runway as quickly as possible. The frequency was busy, which prevented them from communicating with the TWR until 25 s after the conflict began, but by then they had already taken the initiative and vacated the runway. The reaction of the SPP vehicles was fast and appropriate. Lastly, the use of English to give the takeoff instruction to the aircraft did not prevent the TOAM and COAM from understanding it. Thanks to this, they identified the conflict situation they were in and took measures that helped to mitigate the consequences of the incident. All communications between the tower and the SPP vehicles were held in Spanish, which kept the crew of the aircraft from understanding the instruction clearing the SPP vehicles to enter the runway. If this instruction had been given in English, it may have made it more likely for the aircraft crew to detect the conflict, and not just the SPP vehicle drivers....From the standpoint of the aircraft and its actions during the incident, the main conclusion is that it did not contribute to the incident. As with the SPP vehicles, the communications held with the TWR were complete and correct, and each of the aircrafts position in the airport was known by the TWR. The movements made by the aircraft were authorized by the controller, and at no point was the aircraft in an unauthorized position....There was no visual contact between the crew and the SPP vehicles, as confirmed by both the crew and the drivers. This was due not only to the gradient of the runway, but primarily to the distance separating them (in excess of 1000 m at all times).With respect to the controller the CIAIAC analysed:Since the runway is completely visible from the controllers position in single-position operations, that makes it possible to identify the vehicles on the runway, and since visibility on the day of the incident was ideal, and assuming the information on the strip board was true, there are two possibilities:- The takeoff clearance was given without looking at the strip board (that is, looking outside), or- The takeoff clearance was given while looking at the strip board (that is, looking inside).The first option would mean that the student did not visually scan the entirety of the runway (from one threshold to another), since in that case he would have seen the SPP vehicles. The second option would mean that he did not assimilate the information he was seeing on the strip board. The ATC communications showed that the takeoff clearance was issued as the aircraft was entering the runway, before lining up with the centerline. That clearance, at that moment, implies that the controller must have been looking at the aircraft. It thus seems likely that the clearance was given with the controller looking at the runway, but only focusing on the threshold....The ATC communication in the 20 minutes prior to the event showed high use of the frequency. The student controllers actions were correct (use of phraseology, acknowledgments, situational awareness and proactivity). His English level was very high, and this is not thought to have been a factor that influenced the incident.The controllers faster speaking speed as time went by was obvious in his communications, no doubt a result of the increased activity at the airport, and to offset the long time needed for clearance delivery (11 to 17 s) and the pushback and start up clearances (7 and 11 s) he had to issue, in comparison to the other clearances (taxi, line up and wait, takeoff and transfer to APP, lasting 3 to 6 s). The number of aircraft handled during this 20-minute period was 10 departing and 1 arriving aircraft, along with other activities (CECOA and SPP vehicles). The listing of tasks (section 1.9) carried out during the time the controller was on watch indicates that the activity on the frequency was high. The workload increased above what was expected when an aircraft requested to reposition, which doubled the number of communications and coordination required. The increased delay in issuing clearances (from being issued immediately at the start of the shift from being delayed 2-3 minutes) is indicative of the controllers increasing workload. Potential evidence of the increase in workload, in addition to the high use of the frequency, the faster speaking speed and the need to delay clearances, is the fact that in the takeoff clearance issued to IBK5358, the controller forgot to include wind data.To the above we must add the fact that the controller on the frequency was a controller in training, whose cognitive effort is higher than that required of a more experienced person. The student was also a perfectionist, who was in training, who had made two mistakes that the instructor had pointed out to him, one of which was the focus of the training phase he was in. The focus that the student himself mentioned on achieving the proper takeoff sequence, while ignoring the strip board and the lack of visual monitoring, could be the result not only of a lack of experience, but of the students abilities being undermined by the increase in workload.In short, there are indications that the student could have been subjected to a workload during the incident that was too high for him, which affected his ability to focus on and execute tasks that he normally carried out very meticulously....However, based on the service providers own criteria, the number of positions that should have been staffed for this expected number of movements should have been two, since it exceeded the stated capacity by 3 movements/hour and the maximum capacity by 1 movement/hour.32 These values were taken into account by the instructor when setting up the unit, and for the first ten minutes, he in fact staffed two positions. The decision to close one was due, according to the instructors statement, to the subsequent reduction in traffic and to the fact that keeping two positions open for the entire hour would not benefit the student, because the workload would be too low for him.The reality of the incident is that the amount of work in a single-position configuration was too much for the student, and while the decision may have been correct, it may have required more active oversight from the instructor.With respect to the controller's instructor the CIAIAC analysed:Because he was a controller in training, there was an instructor in the control room to help with and supervise the controllers actions. In this incident, the instructors oversight was evident in two observations he made to the student (when the SPP vehicles did not enter the runway the first time, and when he sequenced the three departing aircraft incorrectly before the incident), and when he corrected the assistants mistake when placing a strip on the bay.As his statement showed, he was tracking the sequence of events and was aware of the situation with the vehicles and aircraft, so he knew immediately what had happened when he heard PAPA6 report the event. The immediate instruction he gave the student to cancel the takeoff shows that he was perfectly cognizant of the traffic situation at the airport.However, at the last second, he did not exercise this oversight, and the incident occurred. Based on the information gathered during the investigation, this distraction was due to:- Excess confidence in the abilities of the student controller.- Lack of experience as an instructor, since it was his second day acting in that capacity.- Excessive attention to the assistant, to whom he was giving explanations at the time of the incident.- Lack of experience of the assistant, who was on his first day on the job.
A PIA Pakistan International Airlines Avions de Transport Regional ATR-72-212A, registration AP-BKX performing flight PK-580 from Karachi to Multan (Pakistan), was accelerating for takeoff from one of the runways 25, when the crew rejected takeoff due to a problem with the right hand engine (PW127) and returned to the apron.Pakistan's AIB rated the occurrence a serious incident and opened an investigation.
A UPS United Parcel Service McDonnell Douglas MD-11, registration N277UP performing freight flight 5X-61 from Seoul (South Korea) to Anchorage,AK (USA) with 4 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Seoul Incheon Airport's runway 33L at about 22:40L (13:40Z) when the crew needed to reject takeoff at high speed. The aircraft overran the end of the runway, broke through the approach lights and the localizer antenna and came to stop about 350 meters past the end of the runway on soft ground, the nose gear collapsed. The crew evacuated the aircraft, one crew member received minor injuries. The aircraft received substantial damage.On Jun 8th 2016 the FAA reported on crew remember received minor injuries when the aircraft went off the runway during a rejected takeoff and came to stop with the gear collapsed.In June 2019 South Korea's ARAIB released their final report in Korean only (Editorial Note: (Editorial note: to serve the purpose of global prevention of the repeat of causes leading to an occurrence an additional timely release of all occurrence reports in the only world spanning aviation language English would be necessary, a Korean only release does not achieve this purpose as set by ICAO annex 13 and just forces many aviators to waste much more time and effort each in trying to understand the circumstances leading to the occurrence. Aviators operating internationally are required to read/speak English besides their local language, investigators need to be able to read/write/speak English to communicate with their counterparts all around the globe). The report concludes the probable causes of the accident were:The crew rejected takeoff at high speed at/slightly above V1 due to tyre and drag brace defects at the body gear, the aircraft overran the runway.Contributing factors were:- limited time and information available to the captain to assess the situation- difficulty for the captain to determine the aircraft's in flight performance and the dynamic instability of the body gear drag brace following the defect- decline in braking performance due to the rupture of a hydraulic pipeThe aircraft was accelerating on runway 33L when at about V1 a body gear tyre burst causing damage to the body gear, at about the same time the pilot monitoring called V1 (which was not acknowledged by the pilot flying). As result the acceleration of the aircraft sharply reduced prompting the captain, pilot flying, to reject takeoff due to structural damage. About 3.3 seconds after accelerating through V1 the engines begin to spool down, the aircraft had reached a maximum of 182 KIAS and was 4635 feet before the runway end at that time (the ARAIB annotated that at the nominal V1 of 169 KIAS the distance to stop needed was computed at 5385 feet). The body gear indication changed to unlocked and unsafe. The right brakes 1R hydraulic line ruptures causing the loss of the associated hydraulic system and brakes. The aircraft overran the end of the runway and came to a stop 485 meters/1590 feet past the end of the runway. The nose gear collapsed, one member of the flight crew received minor injuries.

A Flybe de Havilland Dash 8-400, registration G-JEDU performing flight BE-1400 from Dusseldorf (Germany) to London City,EN (UK) with 77 passengers and 4 crew, was climbing out of Dusseldorf's runway 05R following a maximum takeoff power departure, the flight crew faced straight into the sun. The captain called gear up, the first officer inadvertently moved the flaps lever into the up position. The captain, pilot flying, did not notice the error, the aircraft handling appeared normal. The takeoff and climb sequence was subsequently completed normally, the aircraft climbed to FL240 and landed safely at London's City Airport.The UK AAIB released their bulletin concluding the causes of the serious incident were:The Pilot Monitoring retracted the flaps instead of the landing gear after takeoff. This may have occurred because both actions are expected during this phase of flight. Takeoff into the sun may have caused the Pilot Flying some difficulty in noticing the slip.The operator had previously found distraction to be a factor in such occurrences and believed that they were occurring less frequently than in the past. However, its standard operating procedures for flap and landing gear retraction involved the one stage selection and movement of a lever by the Pilot Monitoring in response to a call by the Pilot Flying. Retraction of the flap instead of the landing gear is a human error and is not unique to this operator, aircraft type or stage of flight. Previous occurrences have resulted in action by operators to amend relevant procedures, and the UK CAA accepted the earlier AAIB Safety Recommendation 2006-002 to encourage operators to monitor landing gear and flap mis-selections.The AAIB sumarized the sequence of events and the captain's comments:During the initial climb from Runway 05R at Düsseldorf Airport the commander called for the landing gear to be raised and the co-pilot inadvertently raised the flaps instead. The commander reported that he did not notice the flaps being selected because the sun was shining into the cockpit, making the primary flight display difficult to see. Furthermore, particularly because he had used normal takeoff power for departure, rather than a reduced power setting, the performance of the aircraft masked the effects of the flap retraction.The commander stated that he may have heard the co-pilot mention flaps at the time but because this occurred immediately after another standard operational call relating to flight guidance mode selection, he thought he had misheard. The takeoff sequence was otherwise completed normally.Commanders commentThe commander indicated that he was not immediately aware of the early flap retraction. He characterised this as a skill based error and noted that it could lead the aircraft to stall.
An Aurigny Avions de Transport Regional ATR-72-212A, registration G-COBO performing flight GR-671 from Manchester,EN to Guernsey,CI (UK), was climbing out of Manchester's runway 23L when a passenger informed cabin crew about a loud bang just as the aircraft rotated for takeoff. The flight crew stopped the climb at about 3500 feet and returned to Manchester for a safe landing on runway 23R about 15 minutes after departure.The airline reported the aircraft returned to Manchester a a precaution, an inspection revealed no obvious defects.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Manchester about 15 hours after landing back.
A Taban Air McDonnell Douglas MD-88, registration EP-TBE performing flight HH-258 from Najaf (Iraq) to Mashhad (Iran), was accelerating for takeoff from Najaf's runway 28 when the crew rejected takoff at low speed due to the failure of the right hand engine (JT8D). The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground in Najaf for 60 hours before returning to service.Iran's AIB have opened an investigation into the occurrence rated an incident.On Jun 26th 2019 Iran's AIB released their final report concluding the probable cause of the incident was:There was an internal damage in the turbine rotors, as a result of fatigue and possible back pressure resulting from stall and engine "Surged". The damage led to subsequent failures of airstream and a general failure of engine failure.The AIB analysed:Damage observed in the turbine section was consistent with a disruption in airflow from the compressor resulting in increased exhaust temperatures beyond the limits of the turbine components. Due to the mechanical damage to the engine, the origin of the engine failure and an accurate assessment of the engine condition prior to the occurrence could not be established with certainty but probably by considering effects of above factors, engine compressor stall occurred with high EGT and Vibration exponentially until they reach above their allowable limits. Engine hot zone parts was on exposure to high temperature leaded to fracture of low-pressure turbine 4th stage rotor blades at root which had been creep and elongated before. The number of turbine rotor airfoils that exhibited fatigue is consistent with significant vibratory excitement of turbine stages. Prior to the engine failure, a liberated piece of material, either just preceding or just following from HPT, could travel aft, inducing damage to subsequent turbine stages and resulting in reduced N1 and the subsequent engine failure.4th stage of low pressure turbine (Photo: Iran's AIB):
An Aerodesierto (aka Chile Airways) Boeing 737-200, registration CC-CVI performing a charter flight from Santiago (Chile) to Salvador,BA (Brazil) with 102 soccer fans, was accelerating for takeoff from Santiago when an engine (JT8D) emitted a loud bang prompting the crew to reject takeoff. The aircraft stopped safely.The soccer fans missed the match of their team Chile against Ecuador, which was played at Salvador de Bahia within the Copa America.The passengers reported the crew told them a rabbit or bird was ingested by an engine.

A Maldivian de Havilland DHC-6-200 Twin Otter on floats, registration 8Q-IAG performing a flight from Dhoores Retreat Resort to Male (Maldives) with 12 passengers and 3 crew, was accelerating for takeoff when the right hand float collided with something and bent causing the aircraft to nearly keel over coming to a stop partially submerged with the cockpit under the water level. There were no injuries, the aircraft sustained substantial damage.Maldives Civil Aviation Authority dispatched investigators on site and opened an investigation.Initial information had been the aircraft collided with an object in the water causing the right float to be bent.In a preliminary report dated March 7th 2018 Maldives CAA reported in summary:At the time of the accident, the weather at the departure point was bad. The aircraft was on takeoff roll accelerating when it struck a sea swell and bounced and struck hard on the second swell and continued to strike a third swell. On striking the second swell the crew felt that the right float got detached and on striking the third swell the crew realized that the left float also got detached pushing the aircraft nose into water. The propellers struck the floats cutting into them, damaging the propellers, and stopping the engines. The detached floats were trapped under the wings keeping the aircraft afloat with the nose immersed in water. Water then started rushing into the aircraft.All 12 passengers and three crew were able to evacuate the aircraft without physical injury. Passenger bags were removed. The aircraft was towed and secured at the floating platform.The investigation is still ongoing.On Jun 21st 2019 Maldives' CAA released their final report concluding the probable cause of the accident was:The take-off attempt was made in bad weather, not to the most appropriate direction and with unusually longer swell distances.The CAA provided following synopsis of the accident:At the time of the accident, the weather at the departure point was bad. The aircraft was on take-off roll accelerating when it struck a sea swell, bounced and struck hard on a second swell, continued and struck a third swell. On striking the second swell the crew felt that the right float got detached and on striking the third swell the crew realized that the left float also got detached that pushed the aircraft nose into water. At this point the engines were shut down by the PIC. The floats were cut and the propellers were damaged due to propellers striking the floats. The detached floats were trapped under the wings keeping the aircraft afloat with the nose immersed in water. Water then started rushing into the aircraft.All 12 passengers and three crew were able to evacuate the aircraft without physical injury. Passenger bags were recovered. The aircraft was towed and secured at the floating platform.The captain (34, ATPL, 5,899 hours total, 5,599 hours on type) was pilot monitoring, the first officer (43, ATPL, 4,974 hours total, 4,705 hours on type) was pilot flying.The CAA analysed:No abnormalities were reported during any of the previous flights of the day. Examinations carried out on the wreckage revealed no evidence of any technical defects which could have contributed to the accident.The accident occurred during the take-off run from DOR in bad weather. There were 3 or 4 different patterns of swells, which is normal in DOR. As a 90 degree cross wind take-off, parallel to the swell would have put the Island directly on the take-off path. Therefore the chosen take-off path was keeping the island to the port side (left) of the aircraft.During the take-off run, the aircraft struck a swell which was more like a small bump. The aircraft continued the take-off when it struck the second swell on the right float. The crew felt that the right float got detached when it hit the second swell. The crew tried to adjust the speed on every bounce by lowering the nose primarily to ride the swells and avoid heavy impact on the next swell. On impacting the third swell, the left float also got partially detached and the propellers cut into the floats before the aircraft came to a stop.The engine shutdown procedures and evacuation of the passengers and crew took place in accordance with the procedures laid down in the OM.8Q-IAG being secured (Photo: Maldives Aviation Daily):
A Malindo Air Boeing 737-800, registration 9M-LCK performing flight OD-301 from Bandung (Indonesia) to Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) with 114 passengers and 8 crew, was backtracking runway 29 for departure when upon turning around and line up for takeoff the aircraft went off the right edge of the runway and was disabled. The passengers disembarked normally via stairs. The airline stated: "Malindo Air OD301, a Boeing 737-800 with registration number 9M-LCK, experienced a runway excursion before take-off at 3:25p.m. (Malaysia time) today at Husein Sastranegara International Airport, Bandung, Indonesia." All passengers were safely evacuated, arrangements for their travel were being made.
A Western Air Saab 340A, registration C6-KID performing flight WST-701 from Nassau to Freeport (Bahamas) with 25 passengers and 3 crew, was cleared for takeoff from Nassau's runway 14.About 6 seconds prior to issuing the takeoff clearance to WST-701 tower cleared a private Aztec aircraft for takeoff from runway 27. The crew however taxied their aircraft onto runway 32 and commenced takeoff becoming airborne prior to the Saab, a surveillance camera showed the aircraft half way between taxiways B and D at a height of about 50 feet when it came into sight of the camera. About 12 seconds later C6-KID was observed passing taxiway E, rotated just ahead of taxiway D. By the time C6-KID became airborne the Aztec had already left the camera view, the Saab passed underneath the Aztec.Bahama's Air Accident Investigation Department (AAID) released their Short Investigation Final Report reporting it could not be determined what vertical separation existed between the two aircraft, however, both crews remained unaware of the proximity of the other aircraft. The AAID concluded the probable causes of the serious incident, a near midair collision, were:The poor decision making exercised by the pilot of aircraft Aztec in not following directions issued by ATC, despite advising he understood the instructions given, has been determined as the probable cause of the near mid-air collision.- Also contributing to this near mid-air collision was the actions of the air traffic controller by losing visual on the aircraft he issued instructions to, and the failure on the part of the crew of C6-KID for not observing that another aircraft was on the same runway at the same time before commencing their take-off roll.- The AAID believes this loss of visual contact on the aircraft by the controller, may have been as a result of distraction due to the ongoing shift change at the time, and the fact that the controller was manning two separate radio frequencies3 during a time of high traffic volume, while using a system that required additional training and frequent data input so that all systems can function properly with adequate current information.- The AAID also believes the failure to notice the aircraft by the crew of C6-KID may be the result of distractions or preoccupation with completing final checks while on the runway, before takeoff.- Pilot training, qualification and air traffic controller training, licensing and record keeping practices has been investigated and while not directly contributing to the incident were noteworthy and required action.Additional Findings of SignificanceAir Traffic Controller- Medical Certificate had expired- ATC license was not issuedBahamas Air Navigation Services DivisionAt the time of this incident and commencement of this investigation it was noted that BANSD had;- No documented process to track medical status of Air Traffic Controllers- No ATC personnel in possession of required ATC licenses.- Several ATC personnel were operating without the required current medical certificates.3 ATC management advised this practice is not unusual having one controller manning more than one frequency at a time.However, the internal review conducted have concluded that this practice is unsafe (especially at periods of high traffic volume) and have made recommendations to address this unsafe condition.NOTE: An Air Traffic Control license with associated endorsed ratings, as well as a current medical certificate is required by Bahamas Civil Aviation General Regulations (CAGR) Schedule 8, Subpart B and Subdivision IX, when exercising the privileges of any required certificate.Pilot Aztec- No record of required annual recurrent training as required by CAGR was documented.Crew C6-KID- Failed to observe other aircraft on the runway in time to abort. Possibly due to distractions or pilot duties, crew did not realize another aircraft was taking off toward them until it had passed directly overhead.- Crew continued to their destination and only after returning did they advise they needed to be relieved of duty due to the near mid-air collision incident.The AAID described the weather at the time of the occurrence: "The weather at Lynden Pindling Intl Airport at the time of the occurrence was Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). Bahamas Meteorological Department METAR Report indicated that the wind direction was 090 degrees with speeds at 04 knots. Visibility was reported at 7 nautical miles (nm). Clouds were reported as scattered at 2,000 and 22,000 feet. Temperature was reported as 81°F and Dewpoint 73°F. Altimeter was reported as 29.98 inches of Mercury (Hg)."The AAID released following safety message:Security video footage retrieved documented the takeoff and flight path of both aircraft. The exact takeoff point of the Aztec on Runway 32 was out of camera range and the aircraft came into view at approximately 50 feet above the runway heading northwest. C6-KID subsequently became airborne from Runway 14 at approximately Delta intersection, abeam the fire station. By the time C6-KID became airborne, the Aztec had already crossed over his path and was out of camera view.While the incident investigated did not find that both aircraft were airborne at the same time that would create a conflict of a mid-air collision, the seriousness of two aircraft on opposite ends on the same runway, headed in opposite directions toward each other, cannot be understated.While it was clear the pilot of the Aztec did not follow instructions as issued by ATC, and acknowledged by him, it is still incumbent on all pilots entering an active runway to be cognizant and vigilant of traffic that may be crossing a runway, exiting a runway or in this case departing from a runway.It is recommended that all traffic entering an active runway ensure all required checks are done prior to lining up for takeoff or ensure one crewmember (if multi-crew operation) is always vigilant and looking outside.Based on the investigation of this incident, it appears the crew of C6-KID may have been pre-occupied, possibly with before takeoff checks, or may have been distracted, for whatever reason, and not raising the alarm with ATC when the aircraft was lining up on the opposite end of the same runway and departing toward them.The Aztec was airborne prior to the takeoff roll of C6-KID and therefore it is unlikely that the crew would not have seen the aircraft in time to abort the takeoff, had they been vigilant and focus was outside the aircraft once on the runway in position for takeoff.Transcript of the incident reviewed confirmed the instructions issued by ATC for the Aztec to depart runway 27, the pilot acknowledged the instructions, but still failed to follow them and created a conflict that could have dire consequences had both aircraft become airborne at the same time, toward each other.It is also recommended that greater vigilance be exercised by all ATC personnel when issuing instruction to aircraft while using simultaneous runways for departure or landings, to ensure aircraft are following instructions given. It is also recommended that BANSD either increase its manpower or institute a system whereby the workload is reduced for controllers or eliminate the dual positions or frequencies by a single controller during high traffic periods.Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth based on AAID):
An Alitalia A319-100, registration EI-IMM performing flight AZ-1396 from Genoa to Rome (Italy) with 140 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Genoa's runway 10 when an engine (CFM56) ingested a bird, reportedly a sea gull, prompting the crew to reject takeoff at high speed. The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway about 1400 meters/4650 feet down the runway. The flight was cancelled, the passengers were rebooked onto other flights.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Genoa about 16 hours after the rejected takeoff.
An Austrian Airlines Airbus A320-200, registration OE-LBS performing flight OS-9404 from Catania to Palermo (Italy), was accelerating for takeoff from Catania's runway 08 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 130 knots over ground) due to a abnormal engine indication. The aircraft slowed safely and stopped on the runway. Emergency services responded and checked the brakes. The aircraft was subsequently towed to the apron.Catania Airport reported a technical problem triggered emergency procedures, the crew rejected takeoff and stopped the aircraft on the runway. Emergency services were requested, who checked the aircraft and declared the area safe. The aircraft was towed to the apron, where passengers disembarked normally. One arriving flight needed to be diverted due to the occupied runway.The airline reported a warning indication for an engine prompted the crew to reject takeoff. Emergency services responded but did not need to intervene. As a safety precaution the aircraft was towed to the apron. Technicians checked the aircraft and released it back to service later the day.The aircraft was able to depart about 6 hours after the rejected takeoff, skipped the intermediate stop in Palermo and proceeded directly to the ultimate destination Vienna.
A Corendon Airbus A320-200, registration ZS-GAL performing flight XC-3204 from Graz (Austria) to Antalya (Turkey), was accelerating for takeoff from Graz's runway 17C when the left hand engine ingested a bird and emitted a bang and a puff of smoke. The crew continued takeoff, the aircraft rotated shortly afterwards, climbed to 3000 feet and returned to Graz for a safe landing on runway 17C about 9 minutes after departure. The aircraft taxied to the apron.A replacement Boeing 737-800 registration TC-TJP reached Antalya with a delay of 4.5 hours.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Graz about 29 hours after landing back.
An Air Canada Rouge Boeing 767-300, registration C-GSCA performing flight RV-1901 from Athens (Greece) to Toronto,ON (Canada) with 189 passengers and 9 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Athens' runway 21L when upon selection of initial thrust the crew noticed a slight yaw. When the engines (CF6) accelerated to takeoff thrust a rumbling noise could be heard. When the aircraft accelerated through 80 KIAS the right hand engine began to roll back and became unresponsive to thrust commands. The crew rejected takeoff at 110 KIAS and stopped about 2000 meters/6600 feet down on the runway having become disabled as two outboard main tyres had blown. The crew declared PAN, emergency services responded.
An American Airlines Airbus A330-200, registration N288AY performing flight AA-740 from Philadelphia,PA (USA) to Madrid,SP (Spain), was accelerating for takeoff from Philadelphia's runway 27L when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 60 knots over ground) reporting a small bird in the nose gear. No assistance was needed, the crew taxied the aircraft back to the apron.Tower continued to use runway 27L, no observations of debris on the runway were reported.A passenger reported they were told a nose wheel tyre had blown.The aircraft departed Philadelphia about 4 hours later and reached Madrid with a delay of 4:15 hours.
An Easyjet Europe Airbus A320-200, registration OE-IVC performing flight U2-14 from Edinburgh,SC to London Luton,EN (UK) with 180 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Edinburgh's runway 06.An Norwegian Air International Boeing 737-800, registration EI-FJW performing flight D8-1601 from Newburgh,NY (USA) to Edinbugh,SC (UK) with 159 passengers and 7 crew, was on final approach to Edinburgh's runway 06 advised to expect a late landing clearance. The aircraft continued for the approach until the flare, when the crew received landing clearance, touched down and rolled out.The AAIB reported that by the time the landing B738 flew over the runway surface the departing A320 was still in the takeoff roll. The distance between the two aircraft reduced to 875 meters/2870 feet horizontal. The A320 became airborne 2 seconds prior to the B738 touching down.The AAIB released their final report concluding the probable causes of the serious incident were:A succession of short delays to the departure of OE-IVC and the higher than normal speed approach of EI-FJW led to the rapid closure of the gap between EI-FJW and OE-IVC. The loss of spacing went unnoticed by both the trainee controller and the On-the-Job-Training-Instructor (OJTI) until EI-FJW came out of cloud which was just before the crew prompted them by calling at 0.5 nm. At this point the OJTI made the decision that it was safer to land EI-FJW than risk having two aircraft that he could not separate visually close to each other in cloud above the airport.The crew of OE-IVC were completely unaware of the developing situation as they could not see EI-FJW nor had the trainee controller instructed them either to be ready immediate or cleared them for an immediate takeoff.The AAIB reported Edinburgh tower was staffed by a trainee controller and an OJTI (On-the-Job-Training-Instructor).The A320 had taxied to runway 06 via taxiway A and was holding short of A1. The B738 was at about 6nm from the threshold when tower cleared the A320 to line up runway 06. However, the trainee controller did not turn off the stop bar lights. Another aircraft called ready for departure and the controller talked to them for 9 seconds. Immediately after this transmission the captain of the A320 transmitted "stop bars!", the controller turned off the stop bar lights. The A320 began to taxi into position about 29 seconds after the stop bar lights extinguished.35 seconds after the A320 began to taxi into position tower cleared the A320 for takeoff from runway 06, the B738 was about 3nm from touchdown.The A320 began their takeoff run about 40 seconds after being cleared for takeoff, the B738 was just over 0.5nm from touchdown at that point. Reaching 0.5nm from touchdown the B738 called tower reminding tower they had not yet been cleared to land.The OJTI took over from the trainee controller, decided that it was safer to have the B738 continue the landing instead of having two aircraft over the airport in clouds and not being able to separate from each other visually. The B738 continued, crossed the runway threshold and wsa already in the landing flare when the OJTI issued landing clearance just as the A320 became airborne. 2 seconds later the B738 touched down, the horizontal distance between the two aircraft was 875 meters at that time, the A320 had climbed to 60 feet AGL by that time.The AAIB reported that the B738 was flown by 3 captains: a captain under supervision was occupying the left hand seat, a training captain occupied the right hand seat and was commander of the flight, and a training captain supervising the captain in the left hand seat occupied the observer's seat.The AAIB analysed:At 0945:55 hrs, the preceding aircraft landed at EDI. At this point EI-FJW was 6 nm from touchdown, which was exactly the spacing required in the EDI MATS Part 2 for gap mode.The trainee controller then preceded to give OE-IVC line up clearance as had been planned for the gap before EI-FJW landed. Due to a combination of factors, the gap rapidly closed and the departing aircraft was at only 60 ft aal when the landing aircraft touched down.Factors leading to the gap closureStop BarThe airfield was in safeguarding due to the meteorological conditions and, therefore, the Stop Bars were in use. The trainee controller did not have much experience of working in conditions similar to those of the day of the incident and had little experience of using the Stop Bars. The Stop Bar was not turned off expeditiously and, as a result, OE-IVC could not move from the holding point to line up. There are two possible explanations; the trainee controller may have forgotten to do it or may not have activated the Stop Bar controls correctly. Turning off the Stop Bar requires a controller to move a cursor using a mouse and click within a very small box, before moving the cursor to the beginning of the active runway and clicking again. During this process, the cursor may have been mispositioned or the selection may have been performed in the wrong order, leading to the Stop Bar remaining illuminated.Having been cleared to line up but with the Stop Bar still illuminated, it was natural for the crew of the departing aircraft to then question the illumination of the Stop Bar with the controller. However, before the crew of OE-IVC could do this, another aircraft on the same frequency egan a transmission. As a result, there was a 16 second delay between OE‑IVC being cleared to line up on Runway 06 and the crew asking the controller to turn off the Stop Bar so they could proceed onto the runway. This delay caused a significant part of the gap closure.Speed of landing aircraft on approachEI-FJW had been instructed by EDI approach to maintain a speed of at least 160 KIAS on the approach until 4 nm to assist with the spacing between it and the following aircraft. It would have been more usual for an aircraft on the approach to be instructed to maintain a speed of exactly 160 KIAS until 4 nm from touchdown, so the instruction given to EI-FJW permitted the aircraft to be flown at a higher speed than was normally expected. The crew complied with the instructions and were at 181 kt ground speed at 6 nm when the preceding aircraft touched down on the runway. EI-FJW complied with all the operators requirements for a stable approach, having begun to slow after they passed 6 nm from touchdown. The higher than normal speed of EI-FJW on the approach may have caught the trainee controller by surprise.Any speed control given to an approaching aircraft by the radar controller was displayed on the strip information, and the groundspeed was displayed on the radar picture display at the tower controllers station. However, the trainee controller was more familiar with being able to see the aircraft on the approach and to judge the gap visually rather than relying on the screens provided. With the weather conditions, the trainee controller was unable to see the aircraft until it was inside 2 nm from touchdown. The higher speed of the approaching aircraft combined with the less familiar need to refer to the radar display meant that the closure of the gap went unnoticed until the late stages of the approach.The OJTI, seated or standing behind the trainee controller could not see the screens in detail without making a deliberate attempt to move his position, so the developing situation may also have not been obvious to him.Time taken for the departing aircraft to take offThe crew of OE-IVC were unaware of the closing gap. They had not been instructed to expedite their line-up, nor had they been cleared for an immediate takeoff. Had either of the tower controllers issued these instructions it is likely that the training captain would have taken control of the aircraft and conducted the takeoff. The training captain estimated that this could have saved 10-15 seconds.Reaction to the closing gapEI-FJWThe crew of EI-FJW were familiar with the much busier air traffic environment of LGW, where the aircraft spacing is optimised to allow a large number of movements from a single runway. They were not concerned about the closing gap, as they did not consider it unusual. As the aircraft approached 0.5 nm from touchdown, they could clearly see the other aircraft was still on the runway. PM called the tower controller and was told to expect a late landing clearance. This confirmed in the minds of the crew that the controllers were fully aware of the position of both aircraft.The crew in EI-FJW consisted of three captains, which, for the reasons given earlier, could make the dynamics of decision making challenging especially when considering that the captain who was PM in the left seat was being assessed before completing his training.There may have been reluctance from all three pilots to voice their concerns for fear of jeopardising the assessment.The aircraft commander reported he was tired due to the overnight flight and his previous roster that included several transatlantic flights. He had had as much sleep as could be expected given his roster pattern and his flying performance was unlikely to be affected by fatigue. However, his feeling of tiredness may have made him hesitant to go around because this would extend the flight time.The phenomenon of plan continuation bias may also have added to the crews reluctance to go around even when they had not received a landing clearance at such a late stage.Plan continuation bias is an unconscious cognitive bias to continue [the] original plan in spite of changing conditions. The bias can cause people to discount cues which indicate the situation requires a different course of action and has a stronger effect on behaviour the closer someone is to the completion of their plan; for example, the closer someone is to landing at the planned destination.Overall, the above factors came together to contribute to the crew of EI-FJW not making a decision to discontinue the approach and go around.OE-IVCThe crew of the departing aircraft were unaware of the developing situation and so could not react. The absence of any indication from the tower to the contrary resulted in the aircraft departing as planned. Even after takeoff, they were completely unaware of the situation that had developed and the closeness of EI-FJW behind them.ControllersThe trainee controller was still relying on techniques more suited for use in better weather conditions. The trainee controller was using a rule-based strategy which checked the gap was sufficient as the preceding aircraft touched down and was not effectively monitoring the aircraft speeds or size of the gap as the situation progressed. All this meant that the trainee controller did not become aware of the gap closure until late and so then had little time to react. As the crew of EI-FJW called at 0.5 nm, the trainee controller responded by instructing EI‑FJW to continue the approach. This call also coincided with the RIMCAS Stage 2 visual and audible alert which would have continued in the background until cancelled. Both the 0.5 nm call and the RIMCAS Stage 2 alert may have been unfamiliar to the trainee controller. Whilst the trainee controller would have been familiar with the instructions in EDI MATS Part 2 stating that a RIMCAS Stage 2 alert requires the issue of a go-around unless it is positively known that there is no runway infringement, the trainee controller did not have the capacity or experience to immediately make that decision.The trainee controller had little or no experience of instructing a go-around. This inexperience, together with the short time period available to act after becoming fully aware of what was happening resulted in an inability to recover the situation. The lack of experience probably also caused a reluctance to intervene in such a serious situation immediately without confirmation from the OJTI that it was the correct thing to do.The OJTI was monitoring the trainee controller but had missed the developing situation. He became aware of the seriousness of the situation when EI-FJW came out of cloud a few seconds before the RIMCAS Stage 2 alert began to sound. He was startled by the suddenness of the situation and this caused a further delay in his reaction. His immediate concern was for the separation of the two aircraft. He could see both aircraft out the window and although they were close he was not concerned about them closing together.He considered that it was too late to stop OE-IVC taking off as he considered its speed was above 80 kt because it had passed the glide path aerials as specified in EDI MATS Part 2. His options were therefore to either instruct EI-FJW to conduct a go-around or allow it to land. His biggest concern was that if he instructed the go-around, he would have two aircraft, which he could see were close, disappear into cloud where he could not visually separate them. He made the decision to allow EI-FJW to land, which he did by giving them landing clearance. He considered that the decision was the safest at that point.An earlier intervention could have enabled EI-FJW to go around whilst keeping OE-IVC on the ground, preventing the risk of two aircraft in cloud without minimum separation.Had EI-FJW gone around from the approach, both aircraft would have been airborne with limited lateral separation. Given the TCAS inhibits, neither would have received an RA until reaching 1,000 ft radio altitude (737) or 1,100 ft radio altitude (A320). Whether the aircraft would have received an RA after this point would have depended on the actions of the controller to separate the aircraft, and their relative speeds and climb rates. It is not possible to model the flight paths of the aircraft accurately enough to be able to fully understand whether the TCAS RA would have been activated.Being an OJTI can be a challenging position which requires experience and sound judgement to decide when and how to intervene with a trainee. The OJTI was relatively inexperienced in the role which would have made intervention decisions more challenging. As a trainee controller progresses through the training programme, OJTIs are encouraged to intervene less and less to allow the trainee controller to develop the skills and confidence required to qualify. With the trainee controller a considerable way through the second of three parts of the training, the OJTI would have been expecting the trainee controller to perform with little or no support from him. He had also had two sessions in the days before the incident during which the trainee controller had performed well. These factors and the difficulty of reading the screens could explain why the OJTI was not monitoring the situation closely once the initial gap had been checked and thus it increased the surprise21 factor when the seriousness of the situation became clear to him....

An Indigo Airbus A320-200N, registration VT-ITF performing flight 6E-248 from Mumbai to Delhi (India) with 165 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Mumbai's runway 27 when the right hand engine (PW1127) emitted a loud bang and sparks prompting the crew to reject takeoff at low speed. The aircraft vacated the runway about 1000 meters/3300 feet down the runway and returned to the apron.A replacement Airbus A320-200 registration VT-ITD reached Delhi with a delay of 2.5 hours.On Mar 11th 2019 India's DGCA released their final report concluding the probable cause of the incident was:The stud (bolt) in the combustion chamber got liberated during engine operation which travelled through the HPT and LPT and ultimately impacted and damaged the rd s-t age LPT blades resulting in engine stall.The OEM disposition permitting an inspection interval of 375 hours after detecting a partially attached stud in the combustion chamber, is a contributory factor for the incident.The DGCA reported engines were accelerating for takeoff from Mumbai's runway 27, the thrust levers were advanced into the Flex detent. About 3 seconds later the left hand engine reduced from 80% to 37% N1 and the engine stall warning activated. The crew rejected takeoff at 73 KIAS. The aircraft returned to the apron, where passengers disembarked normally.The left hand engine sustained damage including the liberation of fan blade parts.The DGCA analysed:The neo engines were inducted into service by M/s Indigo Airlines in March 2016.However, ever since their induction, a number of component failures on the engines have been reported primarily:1. No. 3 bearing compartmental seal2. Chip detector in accessory gearbox3. Erosion in combustion chamber4. Detection of cracks/lift offs in the inner and outer liner of combustion chamber On the advice of the manufacturer P&W, the borescopic inspection were being carried out at shorter intervals to detect the failure on ground before it occurs during a flight.A number of borescopic inspections were carried out on the engine to detect any abnormality and the engine (P770139) was kept in service based on the dispositions given by the OEM to M/s Indigo Airlines.During the fourth borescopic inspection on 9th January 2017, the operator had reported that 'Stud appears partially attached to segment'. The OEM had given a disposition stating that any cracking that causes partial detachment or exposure of stud is permitted for inspection interval of 375 hours.During investigation, the combustor floatwall segments displayed coating thermal distress throughout including localized areas of parent material loss. There was a burn through hole at the 12:30 position on the combustion chamber outer liner and floatwall segment where a stud is typically located. The stud was missing and was not found during investigation.Investigation also revealed that the HPT blades and vanes were noticed to have impact damage and coating loss. All LPT 3rd stage blades were fractured above platform and within 50% of span. The likely sequence of events is that the combustor stud, nut, and washer liberated as one piece, which was ingested into the gas path of the engine and travelled through the HPT and LPT impacting and damaging the blades and vanes as it went through, and ultimately impacting and liberating the 3rd stage LPT blades.Component bench testing of the LPT 3rd blade shows the mass of the stud, nut and washer would result in significant damage to the leading edge of the 3rd stage which would reduce the fatigue capability of the blades leading to blade fracture which is consistent in this instant case.
An Ameristar McDonnell Douglas MD-83, registration N786TW performing charter flight 7Z-9363 from Detroit Willow Run,MI to Washington Dulles,DC (USA) with 109 passengers and 7 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Willow Run's 23L at about 15:40L (20:40Z) when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed but overran the end of the runway, broke through the instrument landing system and approach lighting runway 05R, the airport perimeter fence, went over a road and came to a stop about 340 meters/1120 feet past the runway end with collapsed nose gear and main gear in a ditch. One passenger received a minor injury in the evacuation, the aircraft sustained substantial damage.The aircraft was carrying Michigan's Men Basketball Team.The Basketball team reported the aircraft attempted takeoff in high winds, the takeoff was rejected, following strong braking the aircraft went beyond the runway. There were no injuries, everyone on board is safe and sound. The team is now arranging alternative travel.The FAA reported the aircraft on departure roll went off the runway into a fence, the persons on board evacuated via slides, no injuries, the aircraft sustained substantial damage. The occurrence was rated an accident.The NTSB dispatched investigators on site.On Mar 11th 2017 The Aviation Herald received information, that in addition to the collapsed nose gear both main gear struts received fractures to their upper bodies and were folded back when the aircraft went over a rise before the service road inside the airport perimeter.On Mar 12th 2017 the aircraft became briefly "flying" again with the assistance of two cranes, which moved the aircraft into a better location (see video below).On Mar 21st 2017 the NTSB reported the aircraft ran off the end of runway 23L after rejecting takeoff (reason for the rejected takeoff not mentioned). The aircraft was evacuated via emergency slides, one passenger received a minor injury. Although no post accident fire ensued the aircraft sustained substantial damage. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.On Mar 22nd 2017 the NTSB reported that the flight controls moved normally and were free to move, the elevator control tabs moved as commanded, however, the right hand elevator was jammed in a trailing edge down/aircraft nose down position and did not move, while the left hand elevator commenced a large nose up movement as the aircraft accelerated through 152 KIAS and continued in this position for 5 seconds, aircraft accelerating through 166 KIAS with no change in aircraft attitude however. The crew rejected takeoff, the aircraft reached a maximum speed of 173 KIAS. The aircraft went beyond the end of the runway and came to a stop about 1000 feet past the end of the runway. One passenger received a minor injury in the evacuation. The NTSB reported a post flight inspection found the right elevator geared tab inboard pushrod linkage damaged which restricted movement of the right elevator surface but allowed movement of the control tab. After the damaged components were removed, the elevator could be moved by hand. The NTSB reported the pilot in command was Ameristar's chief pilot occupying the right hand seat providing captain differences training to the captain occupying the left hand seat and being pilot flying. The chief pilot had accumulated 9,960 hours total with 2,462 hours on type, the captain had accumulated 15,518 hours total and 8,495 hours on DC-9 type aircraft.On Apr 11th 2018 the NTSB opened their investigation docket. The systems group reported for the right hand elevator: "A visual examination of the tab hinges and control linkages found that the inboard right geared tab links and actuating crank were damaged and in an over-centered position." The NTSB reported subsequently: "The damaged links and associated attachment hardware were removed. After the links were removed, the right elevator was free to move, by hand, within the confines of the elevator stops."On Mar 7th 2019 the NTSB released their final report, praising the crew in the comments associated with the release of the report and concluding the probable cause of the accident was:The NTSB determines that the probable cause of this accident was the jammed condition of the airplanes right elevator, which resulted from exposure to localized, dynamic wind while the airplane was parked and rendered the airplane unable to rotate during takeoff. Contributing to the accident were (1) the effect of a large structure on the gusting surface wind at the airplanes parked location, which led to turbulent gust loads on the right elevator sufficient to jam it, even though the horizontal surface wind speed was below the certification design limit and maintenance inspection criteria for the airplane, and (2) the lack of a means to enable the flight crew to detect a jammed elevator during preflight checks for the Boeing MD-83 airplane. Contributing to the survivability of the accident was the captains timely and appropriate decision to reject the takeoff, the check airmans disciplined adherence to standard operating procedures after the captain called for the rejected takeoff, and the dimensionally compliant runway safety area where the overrun occurred.The NTSB analysed:The captain, who was the PF, executed the rejected takeoff after V1 when he perceived that the airplane did not respond normally when he pulled back on the control column to command rotation. All 116 persons on board evacuated the airplane via the emergency escape slides with only one reported minor injury; however, one slide failed to inflate.FDR data showed that the airplanes right elevator was full TED (trailing edge down) when the flight crew first powered up the airplane on the day of the accident and remained there throughout the accident sequence. An airplane performance study (based, in part, on FDR data) confirmed that airplane did not respond in pitch when the captain pulled on the control column. Before the accident flight, the airplane had been parked on the ramp at YIP for 2 days near a large hangar, and the elevators (which, by design, did not have gust locks) were exposed to high, gusting surface wind conditions. Postaccident examination showed that the right elevators geared tabs inboard actuating crank and links had moved beyond their normal range of travel and became locked overcenter, effectively jamming the right elevator in a full-TED position. Thus, the NTSB concludes that the right elevators jammed condition rendered the airplane unable to rotate during takeoff....Ameristars AMM for the Boeing MD-83 included a warning that the airplane must be parked headed into the wind if gusts were expected to exceed 60 kts and a caution that a visual and physical inspection of all flight control surfaces was required if the airplane was subjected to wind exceeding 65 kts. However, none of the recorded or forecasted wind at YIP exceeded these limits during the time that the airplane was parked on the ramp (the highest reported wind gust was 55 kts and the highest forecasted gust was 48 kts). Thus, the NTSB concludes that, based on the available wind data for YIP, the flight crew was not required to perform high-wind parking procedures or request flight control inspections from maintenance personnel.The amplified normal checklist in the AOM and Ameristar training specified that a pilot must visually check the general condition of the elevators and tabs before each flight segment. The captain performed the preflight inspection and noted no visible damage. Flight crews are not required to physically move the elevator surfaces (which are about 30 ft above the ground), and the geared tab linkage is not visible from the ground. Although it is possible to see when an elevator is positioned full TED (as evident in figure 2, which shows that the accident airplanes jammed elevator was in a full-TED position), a full-TED elevator position is not necessarily indicative of an anomaly because the elevators can freely move to that position under nominal ground wind.The amplified procedures in AOM for the taxi checklist specified that a pilot must move the control column through the full range of travel to determine if the controls are free and normal. The check airman performed this check and noticed nothing unusual, and postaccident examination found that moving the control columns forward and aft resulted in the correct corresponding movement of the elevator control tabs. (Investigators noted some difficulty moving the cockpit control columns; however, this was likely due to impact-damaged airplane structure that was in contact with the control cables.) The control tabs are the only parts of the elevator system that are connected to the control column, and the control tabs were not damaged. Thus, the NTSB concludes that the flight crews preflight inspection and control check during taxi, which were performed in accordance with the procedures specified in the AOM, could not have detected the overcenter position of the right elevator geared tabs linkage or the resultant jammed elevator condition....V1 is the maximum airspeed at which a rejected takeoff can be initiated and the airplane stopped on a runway that is limited by field length. Company guidance specified that initiating a rejected takeoff even 4 to 6 kts (about 1 second) after V1 may result in a runway overrun at high speed. Although the flight crews use of the increased rotation speed to mitigate a possible windshear encounter during takeoff was appropriate, it resulted in the check airman not calling rotate until 5 seconds after the airplane achieved V1. By the time the captain recognized that the airplane would not rotate and called to abort the takeoff, 12 seconds had elapsed since V1, essentially guaranteeing that the airplane would overrun the runway.Ameristar guidance and training specifically stated that the captain was solely responsible for the decision to continue or reject a takeoff and that the no-go decision must be madeand the appropriate procedures initiatedbefore the airplane reached V1. The guidance stated that, in many cases, rejected takeoffs at high speed have resulted in far more negative or catastrophic outcomes than would have been likely if the takeoffs had been continued. For decades, pilot training has extensively emphasized that the no-go decision must be made before V1.However, company guidance also stated that a high-speed rejected takeoff should be made only for safety of flight items, such as a condition where there is serious doubt that the airplane can safely fly. Boeing guidance also stated that rejecting the takeoff after V1 is not recommended unless the captain judges the airplane to be incapable of flight.In the case of this attempted takeoff, it was not until after the airplane had exceeded V1 that the captain discovered that the airplane would not rotate in response to his control inputs. When the check airman called rotate, the captain pulled back on the control column, observed that the airplane did not respond in pitch, then added more back pressure until the control column came further back than for a normal rotation, but the airplane still did not respond. The captain called for the rejected takeoff, and the flight crewmembers applied maximum braking, but the airplane went off the end of the runway. The airplane performance study showed that, assuming the same deceleration profile as that of the accident flight, the captain would have had to start braking 4 seconds sooner for the airplane to have come to a stop on the paved surface. However, at that point in the accident flights takeoff, the captains control column input had been applied for only 3 seconds. A review of FDR data showed that, during the airplanes previous successful takeoff, at 3 seconds after control column input, the airplane had only begun to respond in pitch. Thus, the NTSB concludes that the airplanes lack of rotational response to the control column input during the accident takeoff did not become apparent to the captain in time for him to have stopped the airplane on the runway.Rarely could all of the safeguards in place to ensure an airplane is airworthy before departure (such as proper aircraft maintenance, preflight inspections, and control checks) fail to detect that an airplane was incapable of flight, as occurred with the jammed elevator on the accident airplane. Perhaps even more remarkable was that a flight crew would be placed in a situation in which the airplanes inability to fly would not be discoverable until after it had accelerated past V1 during a takeoff roll. The captain had extensive flight experience with many takeoffs, but none of them presented a scenario like the one he faced during the accident takeoff. Although the captain was relatively new to flying the Boeing MD-83, because of his prior experience in the Boeing DC-9 (a variant with an identical elevator system and controls), he correctly assessed the state of the accident airplane and quickly called for and initiated the rejected takeoff. Thus, the NTSB concludes that, once the airplanes inability to rotate became apparent, the captains decision to reject the takeoff was both quick and appropriate.Crew coordination during takeoff is essential to managing one of the most critical phases of a flight. Effective crew coordination and performance depend on the flight crewmembers having a shared mental model of each task; such a mental model, in turn, is founded on effective standard operating procedures (SOPs) (FAA 2017b). Flight crew adherence to SOPs during a takeoff, including maintaining the defined roles of PF and PM, is of paramount importance to flight safety (FAA 2017b).Although Ameristars procedures for a rejected takeoff clearly establish that the responsibility for the go/no-go decision is exclusively that of the captain, in this flight, the PM was also a check airman providing airplane differences instruction to the captain trainee; thus, the check airman was the PIC of the flight. This increased the potential for confusion as to who was truly responsible for the go/no-go decision during an anomalous situation. Instructors typically have more experience in the airplane than the pilot receiving instruction (as was the case with this crew) and are primed to assume control should the trainees actions pose a risk to the flight. Although the check airman instinctively reached toward the control column after the captains abort call out (and stated to the captain that they should not reject a takeoff after V1), the check airman did not take control of the airplane but rather observed that the captain had initiated the rejected takeoff procedures and then took action to assist the captain in executing those procedures.The flight crews coordinated performance around the moment that the captain rejected the takeoff showed that both pilots had a shared mental model of their responsibilities. By adhering to SOPsrather than reacting and taking control of the airplane from the captain traineethe check airman demonstrated disciplined restraint in a challenging situation. Had the check airman simply reacted and assumed control of the airplane after the captain decided to reject, the results could have been catastrophic if such action were to further delay the deceleration (at best) or to try to continue the takeoff in an airplane that was incapable of flight. Thus, the NTSB concludes that the check airmans disciplined adherence to company SOPs after the captain called for the rejected takeoff likely prevented further damage to the airplane and reduced the possibility of serious or fatal injuries to the crew and passengers.Related NOTAMs:03/041 - NAV ILS RWY 23L LOC U/S. 08 MAR 20:53 2017 UNTIL 09 MAR 23:59 2017.

The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The aircraft remained on the ground for about 3 hours while maintenance worked on the aircraft, then departed and reached Paris with a delay of about 3:25 hours.
A Skywest Canadair CRJ-900 on behalf of Delta Airlines, registration N549CA performing flight DL-7335 from Detroit,MI to Grand Rapids,MI (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Detroit's runway 22L when the crew rejected takeoff due to smoke on board. The aircraft stopped on the runway and was evacuated.A passenger reported the aircraft was evacuated due to a fire on board.The airline reported the aircraft suspended takeoff due to a smokey odour on board. The passengers disembarked through all doors and were bussed to the terminal.A replacement CRJ-700 registration N630SK reached Grand Rapids with a delay of about 14 hours.
An Envoy Embraer ERJ-145, registration N662EH performing flight MQ-3603 from Chicago O'Hare,IL to Birmingham,AL (USA), received clearance "fly heading 100, runway 10L at DD, cleared for takeoff", the crew acknowledged "100, 10L cleared for takeoff". Shortly after becoming airborne the aircraft turned left however into the departure path out of runway 09R.An American Airlines Boeing 737-800, registration N959AN performing flgiht AA-272 from Chicago O'Hare,IL to New York JFK,NY (USA), was climbing out of runway 09R on a different tower frequency having become airborne almost the same time as MQ-3603, a loss of separation occurred with MQ-3603.Tower 10L recognized the conflict, MQ-3603 had already turned onto a heading of about 045 degrees, and instructed MQ-3603 to stop the climb followed by an instruction "turn right heading 140 immediately". The crew stopped the climb at about 1800 feet MSL and turned right, the aircraft became clear of conflict. Both aircraft continued to their destinations without further incident.The FAA opened an investigation into the occurrence.American Airlines reported both American Airlines and Envoy are aware of the issue and are cooperating with the investigation.https://flightaware.com/live/flight/ENY3603/history/20190301/1805Z/KORD/KBHMhttps://flightaware.com/live/flight/AAL272/history/20190301/1801Z/KORD/KJFK
A KLM Boeing 747-400, registration PH-BFS performing flight KL-602 from Los Angeles,CA (USA) to Amsterdam (Netherlands), was accelerating for takeoff from Los Angeles' runway 24L when the crew rejected takeoff at lo speed. Tower asked the crew to roll down the runway passing the next exit before vacating the runway. The crew advised one of their engines (CF6) didn't spin up as much as they wanted. The aircraft returned to the apron.A passenger reported they were kept on board for about 2 hours while maintenance were working on the #2 engine (left inboard). The flight was subsequently cancelled and the passengers were rebooked onto other flights.The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground for about 49 hours, then departed for flight KL-604 of Feb 27th.
An Air Canada Rouge Boeing 767-300, registration C-FMWP performing flight RV-1712 from Toronto,ON (Canada) to Punta Cana (Dominican Republic) with 280 passengers and 8 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Toronto's runway 23 when the crew observed a bird, felt an impact and a yaw, however, engine parameters remained normal. The crew continued takeoff and levelled briefly off at 5000 feet to assess the situation, then decided to continue the flight as all indications were still normal. Enroute at FL330 about 260nm southsoutheast of Toronto the crew received indications of increasing vibrations of the left hand engine (PW4060) and decided to return to Toronto. The aircraft landed overweight but safely back on Toronto's runway 23 about 100 minutes after departure.The Canadian TSB reported based on the damage observed during inspection maintenance decided to replace the left engine.NAV Canada reported the remains of a bird of prey were found on runway 23 after RV-1712 reported a possible bird strike.https://flightaware.com/live/flight/ROU1712/history/20190214/1620Z/CYYZ/MDPC
A United Boeing 767-300, registration N648UA performing flight UA-947 from Amsterdam (Netherlands) to Washington Dulles,DC (USA) with 219 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff on Amsterdam's runway 24 when the crew reported "Tower, this is United 947, we have to go ahead and abort the takeoff here". The aircraft slowed safely, the crew advised no assistance was needed and they were able to vacate the runway. The crew subsequently was handed off to ground, on ground requested emergency services to attend to the aircraft to check the temperatures of the right hand brakes advising they had a hot brakes indication.The aircraft continued taxi about 5 minutes after arrival of emergency services and returned to the gate.The aircraft is still on the ground in Amsterdam about 11 hours later, the flight was cancelled.
A Juneyao Airlines Airbus A320-200, registration B-8236 performing flight HO-1332 from Okinawa (Japan) to Shanghai Pudong (China) with 115 people on board, was cleared to line up runway 18 and wait. The crew read the instruction back correctly, lined up but commenced takeoff.At the time a Japanese Coast Guard aircraft with 5 occupants on board was still in the process of vacating the runway after landing.The A320 became airborne and continued to Shanghai for a safe landing.Japan's Transportation Safety Board (JTSB) rated the occurrence a serious incident involving a high risk of collision and dispatched four accident investigators on site.On Feb 14th 2019 the JTSB released their final report concluding the probable causes of the serious incident were:It is highly probable that this serious incident occurred as follows: Without receiving a takeoff clearance from the Tower, the Aircraft A commenced a take-off roll on the runway where the Aircraft B, which had landed earlier, was still present on the runway; furthermore, although the Aircraft A had failed to hear the Towers instructions to stop immediately, it continued take-off roll.As for the reason that the Aircraft A commenced a take-off roll without a take-off clearance from the Tower, it is somewhat likely that the PIC failed to make mutual confirmation of whether to receive the take-off clearance among the flight crew members and made a hasty judgment that they would have received it.The JTSB analysed:Take-off clearanceIn principle, it is required that the take-off clearance should be issued in the order of the following words and terms such as wind direction and wind velocity, runway number, and Cleared for take-off. It is necessary for the flight crew member to read back the term cleared for take-off clearly.According to the ATC communications records, it was confirmed that there would be neither the take-off clearance from the Tower to the Aircraft A nor the read-back of Cleared for take-off from the Aircraft A to the Tower.The commencement of a take-off roll of the Aircraft AIt is somewhat likely that the PIC of the Aircraft A, expecting that the take-off clearance would be issued promptly, ran away with the idea from his past experience at Naha Airport that the take-off clearance had been issued at the same time when the Tower started transmitting the instructions for the cancellation of the altitude restriction; therefore, with a hasty judgment he moved the lever to increase the engine thrust and released the brakes.It was probable that the PIC should have made mutual confirmation of whether to receive the take-off clearance from the Tower among the flight crew members without fail.On the other hand, it is somewhat likely that while hearing the Towers instructions for the cancellation of the altitude restriction and seeing the PIC start to move the thrust lever in front of him, the SO perceived mistakenly that they had received a take-off clearance or he read back inaccurately to the Tower without surely grasping the contents of ATC communications.It is important for flight crews to find generally possible errors such as hasty judgments and misunderstandings and prevent them from leading up to serious consequences by complying with basic procedures stated in the standard operation procedures (SOP) regarding the read back and mutual confirmation of ATC instructions and appropriately exercising CRM skills for monitors, assertions and others.Regarding the fact that the Aircraft continued take-off rollRegarding the fact that the Aircraft A continued take-off roll even though the Tower instructed it to stop immediately, it is highly probable that the flight crew members of the Aircraft A had failed to hear the Towers instructions because at that time there were no abnormalities identified in the situation of communications of the Aircraft A, and the flight crews of the other aircraft, who were listening on the same frequency as the Aircraft A, had clearly heard the Tower giving instructions to the Aircraft A to stop immediately.As for the reason the flight crew members of the Aircraft A had failed to hear the Towers instructions, it is somewhat likely that as the Tower interrupted its transmissions to the next departing aircraft and transmitted to the Aircraft A, the flight crew members of the Aircraft A could not recognize that the Towers instructions to stop immediately were addressed to them even if the Tower called out DKH1332 repeatedly.Flight crew members must listen to the tower communications even after the take-off procedure has started, because the instructions to immediately stop from the tower controller after the take-off roll are issued to avoid the danger.ATC communications conducted in the observer seatAs the Company allows flight operations with a three-pilot system where an additional flight crew member in the observer seat is in charge of the ATC communications, on-the-job training for ATC communications is frequently conducted in the observer seat.It is probable that it would be difficult for the flight crew members to confirm that they share the communication contents when ATC communications are conducted by a flight crew member in the observer seat because the seating setups for the flight crew members are separated into the front and rear seats, which make it difficult to confirm their mutual facial expressions. In this case, it is necessary to make more proactive and reliable mutual confirmation among the flight crew members in order to ensure that they grasp the contents of ATC communications and share the information.As at the time of the serious incident, the SO in the observer seat was on-the-job training for ATC communications; therefore, it is probable that the PIC and the FO should have more carefully monitored and confirmed the ATC communications.Risk assessmentAs shown in Figure 3, the estimated separation between the Aircraft A and the Aircraft B was 1,330 m. According to ICAO Manual on the Prevention of Runway Incursions, it is certain that the severity of risk for this serious incident falls in the Category C (an incident characterized by ample time and/or distance to avoid a collision).Metars:ROAH 181100Z 13005KT 9999 FEW025 21/16 Q1016=ROAH 181030Z 14006KT 9999 FEW025 21/16 Q1016=ROAH 181000Z 13006KT 080V160 9999 FEW025 22/16 Q1016=ROAH 180930Z 13008KT 9999 FEW025 22/15 Q1016=ROAH 180900Z 13009KT 080V160 9999 FEW027 23/15 Q1015=ROAH 180830Z 15009KT 9999 SCT027 23/16 Q1016=ROAH 180800Z 14008KT 090V170 9999 SCT028 23/16 Q1016=ROAH 180730Z 13008KT 090V170 9999 FEW030 23/15 Q1016=ROAH 180700Z 14009KT 060V170 9999 FEW030 23/15 Q1016=ROAH 180630Z 15009KT 9999 FEW030 24/15 Q1016=ROAH 180600Z 14009KT 090V180 9999 FEW035 24/15 Q1016=ROAH 180530Z 14010KT 110V180 9999 FEW035 24/15 Q1016=ROAH 180500Z 12010KT 9999 FEW035 24/15 Q1017=The aircraft positions at the time the takeoff roll began (Graphics: JTSB):The aircraft positions at the time the Coast Guard aircraft had vacated the runway (Graphics: JTSB):
A Jazz Aviation de Havilland Dash 8-400, registration C-GGMU performing flight QK-8946 from Toronto,ON to Saint John,NB (Canada), was accelerating for takeoff from Toronto's runway 24R when the left hand engine outboard cowl door separated from the nacelle and struck the left wing leading edge causing damage to the de-icing boots. The crew remained unaware of the occurrence, there were no abnormal engine or other system indications nor were there any engine vibrations. The aircraft continued to destinaton for a safe landing.The Canadian TSB reported the missing door was noticed only after the aircraft had parked at the terminal. The door was found on runway 24R in Toronto. The operator's maintenance had performed a pre-flight inspection of the engine including engine oil quantity checks in the area of the missing cowl. The operator is investigating.Transport Canada's Airworthiness reported: "Another aircraft was dispatched to operate the outbound flight. Company Maintenance Personnel and a replacement Door were on the aircraft. Prior to flight, a Service Check and Oil Check were carried out by CYYZ Maintenance, the aircraft overnighted in CYYZ. The Operator inspected the door and found all latches in the locked position with no obvious damage to any of them. The door support strut was missing. CYYZ was advised about the missing strut. They confirmed they had done a full sweep and runway inspection with no sign of the strut. TSB was notified. A Service Difficulty Report (SDR) was submitted. Maintenance issued a Maintenance Safety Alert to all Maintenance Personnel. The Aircraft was returned to service following replacement of the Door and L/H Inboard Leading Edge Assembly. This is the first event of this type for this Operator; however, there have been other similar events with other operators of this aircraft Type. Additionally, Bombardier released Service Bulletin (SB) which includes installing a placard to each cowl door describing (via symbols) the procedures for properly closing the door. All Jazz aircrafts will have this SB completed if not previously done."https://flightaware.com/live/flight/JZA8946/history/20190125/1325Z/CYYZ/CYSJ
A Skywest Canadair CRJ-900 on behalf of Delta Airlines, registration N896SK performing flight OO-3863/DL-3863 from Salt Lake City,UT to Billings,MT (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Salt Lake City's runway 35 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed. The aircraft slowed safely and came to a stop about 2000 meters/6600 feet down the runway. Emergency services responded and checked the aircraft. About 6 minutes after the rejected takeoff the aircraft vacated the runway and taxied to the apron.A replacement Canadair CRJ-700 registration N641CA reached Billings with a delay of about 2 hours.A passenger reported following the rejected takeoff the captain announced they had stopped due to an aft lavatory smoke alarm. There had been some smoke, however, they would return to the apron and disembark there. The passenger added the captain had also made an announcement he didn't want to jinx the passengers, however, the aircraft had been in the hangar prior to departure, so that they were able to immediately depart without the necessisity to de-ice and thus would bypass other aircraft waiting to be de-iced.
A United Boeing 767-300, registration N646UA performing flight UA-957 from Geneva (Switzerland) to Newark,NJ (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Geneva's runway 04 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 130 knots over ground) following a bird strike into one of the engines (PW4060). The aircraft slowed safely, vacated the runway and stopped on the adjacent taxiway, emergency services responded. Two flights were instructed to go around as result of the rejected takeoff and the needed runway inspection.The aircraft was towed to the apron about 90 minutes after the rejected takeoff.The flight was cancelled.The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground in Geneva for about 29 hours, then departed as flight UA-2797 to Newark.
A GoAir Airbus A320-200, registration VT-GOS performing flight G8-338 from Delhi to Mumbai (India) with 158 passengers and 6 crew, was in the takeoff roll at about 115 KIAS out of Delhi's runway 09 when a bird struck the right hand engine (CFM56) causing vibrations and abnormal sounds. The crew continued takeoff, stopped the climb at 3000 feet, shut the left hand engine down and decided to return to Delhi. The crew subsequently recognized they had shut the wrong engine down, restarted the left hand engine and reduced the right hand engine to idle. The aircraft landed safely on runway 10 about 20 minutes after departure.A replacement Airbus A320-200 registration VT-WAF reached Mumbai with a delay of 2.5 hours.India's media are reporting the crew allegedly continued the flight following the bird strike and only returned to Delhi after 45 minutes. India's DGCA rated the occurrence a serious incident, opened an investigation against both pilots and de-rostered them.On Jun 23rd 2017 India's media changed their coverage now reporting quoting "a source" (raising the impression that the source might have been inside the DGCA), that the crew "allegedly" shut down the good, unaffected engine (CFM56) after a bird had been ingested by the other engine during takeoff. The crew soon recognized their mistake while maintaining 2000 feet, restarted the shut down engine and were lucky that the bird stricken engine had not lost thrust.Radar data show the aircraft became airborne at 11:11L (05:41Z), climbed to 3000 feet, briefly reached a maximum speed of 228 knots over ground and touched down at 11:31L (06:01Z). The aircraft was scheduled to depart at 10:45L, 45 minutes prior to the actual landing back.The occurrence aircraft resumed service about 11.5 hours after landing back.On Feb 4th 2019 India's DGCA released their final report concluding the probable cause of the incident (!!) was:Incident was caused by incorrect identification of engine affected with high vibration followed by non-adherence to recommended procedures, lack of situational awareness, poor Cockpit Resource Management and poor handling of aircraft during emergency subsequent to bird strike. The captain (64, ATPL, 23,507 hours total, 13,187 hours on type) was pilot flying, the first officer (30, CPL, 936 hours total, 730 hours on type) was pilot monitoring.The DGCA described the sequence of events:During take-off roll, crew experienced abnormal sound & vibrations. Being unsure of the reason for vibrations, First Officer enquired PIC for rejecting take-off but PIC decided to continue for take-off as he was not sure that the aircraft would stop within the available runway, if executed rejected take-off, and probably wanting to investigate the problem after getting airborne. ECAM advisory for high N1 vibration of Engine # 2 came at 05:40:32 hrs as value of N1 vibration of Engine # 2 reached above specified limit, i.e. ¡Ý 6. The vibration advisory was not called out by First Officer. Aircraft IAS was 129 knots at this stage. Values of V1, VR & V2 were calculated to be 146 knots, 146 knots and 147 knots respectively.After getting airborne, cockpit crew noticed the problem of high engine vibration but assessed the situation incorrectly. As a result, they shut down the Engine # 1 (unaffected engine) by putting its MASTER- OFF at 05:41:48 hrs and increased power to TO/GA on the Engine # 2 (affected engine).Crew declared emergency due to engine problem to ATC, Delhi at 05:41:50 hrs and requested immediate turn back to Delhi for landing, which was granted by ATC.During subsequent conversations while climbing, wherein PIC inquired about the engine vibrations, First Officer repeatedly prompted PIC about Engine # 1 vibration out of limits.The aircraft was climbing on affected engine¡¯s power varying from TO/GA to CLIMB while the unaffected engine was shutdown. On directions from ATC, aircraft stopped climbing at 05:43:13 hrs at around 3330 ft altitude. Subsequently, PIC recognized that the Engine # 2 is affected with high vibrations. Crew realized their mistake at 05:43:42 hrs about shutting down the wrong engine and decided to switch on the unaffected engine.Crew put MASTER-ON of the unaffected engine at 05:43:49 hrs and attempted to start the engine. While attempting the start of Engine # 1, the Engine # 2 power was put on IDLE at 05:44:15 hrs. At this stage, aircraft was flying at an altitude of around 3332 ft with only affected engine running on IDLE. The attempt to start Engine # 1 resulted in ¡®Start Valve Fault¡¯ at 05:44:57 hrs. Crew took appropriate action to rectify the same. Engine # 2 power was put on CLIMB again from 05:45:42 hrs up to 05:45:59 hrs.First Officer confirmed at 05:45:58 hrs that Engine # 1 is available. Engine # 2 was put to IDLE at 05:46:00 hrs and Engine # 1 put to CLIMB on 05:46:01 hrs. Aircraft was at 3024 ft altitude at this stage.As per the occurrence report, the weather, after take-off, was very turbulent and the autopilot was not holding. Autopilot was disengaged at 05:41:50 hrs and several times from 05:45:43 hrs to 05:46:44 hrs.In the process of starting Engine # 1, aircraft lost considerable amount of energy which probably combined with manual handling of aircraft, immediately resulted in activation of protective ALPHA FLOOR at 05:46:01 hrs which lasted for 28 seconds. Crew carried out appropriate action and ALPHA FLOOR got deactivated at 05:46:29 hrs at 2600 ft altitude. ECAM advisory for high N1 vibration of Engine # 2 went off at 05:46:37 hrs.Value of N1 vibration of Engine # 2 was above the specified limits (¡Ý 6) for approximately six minutes. The maximum value of N1 vibration of Engine # 2 recorded was 9.9.While in approach for the landing at 05:50:57 hrs, crew requested ATC for Go-around as they were too high on a glide. The same was granted by ATC immediately. Crew initiated Go-around at approximately 05:51:07 hrs with Engine # 1 on FLX-MCT and Engine # 2 on IDLE.In the second approach, aircraft landed uneventfully on Runway 10 at Delhi at 05:58:36 hrs with Engine # 2 on IDLE. No injury to any person was reported in the incident.While taxiing to the allocated stand for parking, not realizing their position with respect to parking stand, crew took wrong turn. Crew of Follow Me # 8 realized the same and communicated to Surface Movement Control (Ground) to ask aircraft to hold the position and switch off the engines. Aircraft held its position and switched off both the engines at 06:01:40 hrs. Subsequently, aircraft was towed to reposition it correctly on the allotted parking stand.On arrival, during physical inspection, the blood stains were observed spread on the acoustic panel of Engine # 2 & damage was observed on the tips of the leading edge of two fan blades i.e. blade # 21 & # 22.As crew were unaware about the Bird Strike, no information was given to ATC, Delhi for the same during the incident flight. Identification of species of struck bird could not be carried out as only blood stains were observed on acoustic panel of Engine # 2.Following the return the crew operated the flight on the replacement aircraft.The DGCA analysed:Operational aspects:- Both the crew members were medically fit, had adequate rest and found to be within FDTL limits before they operated flight on June 21st 2017. Medical fitness & FDTL is not considered as a factor to this incident.- Crew had completed ¡®Before Take-off checks¡¯.- Aircraft suffered with bird strike on engine # 2 while take-off roll at 5:40:29 hrs at around 115 knots IAS. V1, VR & V2 were calculated to be 146 knots, 146 knots & 147 knots respectively. Both crew observed abnormal sound & vibrations in cockpit. At 5:40:32 hrs at 129 knots IAS, ECAM Advisory with regard to N1 vibrations of Engine # 2 was displayed, which was not called out by First Officer. However, First Officer enquired PIC for rejecting take off.- PIC could have rejected take-off as speed was well below V1, but as the aircraft was in high speed range he was not sure that the aircraft would stop within the available runway, if executed rejected take-off. Having no input with regard to engine # 2 vibrations, and probable intention to investigate the problem after getting airborne, PIC continued for take-off. - During take-off roll, there was no input from First Officer regarding high engine vibrations and further there was no red ECAM warning and amber ECAM caution. PIC¡¯s decision to continue for take-off, in absence of any abnormal input from First Officer, was in line with FCTM guidelines.- Crew did not complete Take-off checks & After Take-off checks.The DGCA analysed that the left engine was relighted with the assistance of the starter, the "starter assisted relight" procedure was carried out.The DGCA analysed: "In the process of starting of Engine # 1, crew did not monitor the decreasing speed of the aircraft; resulting into considerable loss of energy under the deficiency of the power for a brief period combined with the handling the aircraft without autopilot, probably lead to activation of ALPHA FLOOR at 3024 ft and 139 knots IAS. Due to activation of ALPHA FLOOR aircraft got TO/GA thrust from both the engines as the autothrust was already engaged. ¡®TO/GA LOCK¡¯ appeared after 24 seconds of activation of ALPHA FLOOR."Example of ECAM engine display (Graphics: DGCA India):
An Alitalia Airbus A330-200, registration EI-EJN performing flight AZ-759 from Seoul (South Korea) to Rome Fiumicino (Italy), was accelerating for takeoff from Seoul's runway 34 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 45 knots over ground) due to a problem with the right hand engine (CF6), which fluctuated between 60 and 90% N1. The aircraft returned to the apron.The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground for about 44 hours, then positioned to Rome as flight AZ-8759.
A Yakutia Airlines Boeing 737-800, registration VP-BVE performing flight R3-4441 from Neryungri to Krasnojarsk (Russia) with 102 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Neryungri's runway 26 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 60 knots over ground) after the tail of the aircraft contacted the runway surface. The aircraft slowed without further incident and returned to the apron. There were no injuries, the damage is being assessed.The airline reported the crew rejected takeoff in the early stages of the takeoff due to an incorrect takeoff configuration which did not permit the continuation of takeoff.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Neryungri about 13 hours after the rejected takeoff.On Dec 12th 2018 Rosaviatsia reported the aircraft carried 102 passengers and 6 crew, 986kg of luggage, 71kg of mail and 3594 kg of cargo. During takeoff the tail contacted the runway, the takeoff was aborted and the aircraft returned to the apron. There were no injuries. A post flight inspection found damage to the tail.On Jan 24th 2019 East Siberian Transport Prosecution Office reported the captain of the flight was fined for 12500 Rubels according to administrative code due to attempting takeoff with the center of gravity (CG) outside permitted limits. The actual passenger seating was not in line with the load data computed by the crew. The states attorney said: "This was inadequate performance of duties by the flight crew." Charges have also been brought against the airline. Six officials of the airline including management have been brought to disciplinary responsibility. The tail:
A KLM Boeing 787-9, registration PH-BHH performing flight KL-606 from San Francisco,CA (USA) to Amsterdam (Netherlands), was cleared for takeoff from San Francisco's runway 01R and was accelerating, when tower cancelled the takeoff clearance. The crew rejected takeoff at low speed and vacated the runway, tower explained the company had called to cancel the takeoff clearance, obviously there was a load issue. The crew had been handed incomplete/incorrect cargo data, dispatch sent the correct data, the crew re-computed their takeoff performance and departed about 30 minutes after the rejected takeoff.
An Air Canada Boeing 737-8 MAX, registration C-FSCY performng flight AC-1049 from Palm Springs,CA (USA) to Calgary,AB (Canada) with 164 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Palm Springs' runway 31L when the crew received a Master Caution for the forward main door and rejected takeoff at about 110 KIAS. The aircraft stopped on the runway, the crew declared PAN PAN and vacated the runway. Flight attendants confirmed the forward main door appeared to be properly closed. Emergency services checked the hot brakes, the aircraft was subsequently able to return to the apron.The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground in Palm Springs for about 24 hours, then operated flight AC-2049 to Calgary.
An Air France Boeing 777-200 freighter, registration F-GUOC performing freight flight AF-6724 from Paris Charles de Gaulle (France) to Mexico City (Mexico), was accelerating for a balanced takeoff from Charles de Gaulle Airport's runway 26R when the crew detected the aircraft wasn't accelerating quickly enough and firewalled the engines. The aircraft took off without further incident, the crew discovered their takeoff weight had been programmed 100 tons below actual takeoff weight resulting in incorrect takeoff power and reference speed computations, and completed a safe landing in Mexico City about 11:15 hours later.The airline reported: "Air France confirms that a data insertion error on take-off of cargo flight AF6724 operated by a Boeing 777 F from Paris-Charles de Gaulle to Mexico on 22 May 2015 led to insufficient acceleration at the beginning of take-off. The crew, who noticed this slow acceleration, immediately reacted by applying full thrust. The aircraft took off normally and the flight continued to its destination. The crew spontaneously declared this event by ASR (Air Safety Report) and informed their superiors." The French BEA was informed.On Jun 2nd 2015 the French BEA reported in their weekly bulletin, that the crew used 243 tons of takeoff weight instead of 343 tons for computation of their takeoff performance, the resulting speeds were input into the flight management system. During rotation for takeoff the crew noticed the aircraft did not become airborne, firewalled the engines, established maximum pitch possible without tail strike, lifted off, climbed out to safety and continued to destination. The BEA rated the occurrence a serious incident and opened an investigation.On Dec 21st 2018 the BEA released their final report in French only (Editorial note: to serve the purpose of global prevention of the repeat of causes leading to an occurrence an additional timely release of all occurrence reports in the only world spanning aviation language English would be necessary, a French only release does not achieve this purpose as set by ICAO annex 13 and just forces many aviators to waste much more time and effort each in trying to understand the circumstances leading to the occurrence. Aviators operating internationally are required to read/speak English besides their local language, investigators need to be able to read/write/speak English to communicate with their counterparts all around the globe).The final report concludes the probable causes of the serious incident were:The overflight at low height of the runway end during takeoff was the result of a take-off undertaken with erroneous parameters (low take-off speeds, flap setting and insufficient thrust).The false parameters entered in the FMS and used for the take-off were the result of a performance calculation based on a mass of 100 tons less than the real mass of the aircraft. The error of 100 tons was the result of erroneous calculations by the crew as well as entering the wrong mass into their performance tool (EFB)The following elements have contributed to the absence of detection and the propagation of the error of 100 tons: - The manipulation by the crew in various formats, tools and forms for the calculation of take off data- The non-realization of orders of magnitude, partly related to the increasing use of performance tools- The procedures include various elementary checks which proved not sufficiently robust, not taking into account sufficiently the operational context and the working procedures of the crew. These procedures rely on a double calculation supposedly independent whereas a simple verbalization can default the independence. The procedures do not include a means of detection of gross errors or simultaneous checks of the three media using mass data. (Load Status, Performance Tool and FMS)- The absence of a system for detecting and preventing such gross errors and to warn the crew that the measured performance during take-off roll is insufficient, such as available on most commercial airliners, on the aircraft in question. The BEA reported the flight crew consisted of captain (63, ATPL, 21,331 hours total, 5,272 hours on type), being pilot monitoring for the departure, and three first officers. The first first officer (49, ATPL, 9,717 hours total, 1,328 hours on type) was pilot flying for departure, during departure preparation these two pilots remained in the cockpit, while the other two first officers conducted the walk around. The first officer performed mental arithmetic to compute the takeoff mass and erroneously computed 243 tons for takeoff weight. He entered the 243 tons into his electronic flight bag and derived the according takeoff paramenters.The captain correctly computed the takeoff mass at 343 tons, however, committed a typo while entering the mass into the electronic flight bag typing 243 tons.First officer and captain subsequently compared the results of their electronic flight bags, found the numbers in agreement and typed the results into the FMS.The crew prepared for a balanced takeoff using an assumed temperature of 37 degrees C, flaps 5 degrees and V1=143 KIAS. The captain expressed doubt about the speeds as they were 20 knots lower than computed by the FMS, the crew decided to postpone completing the speed data until fueling was complete.After loading was complete the first officer recomputed the takeoff mass again committing the same error and reaching 241.5 tons of takeoff mass. He then compared the performance data and found them correct.The captain compared the takeoff mass figures with the FMS and found them correctly entered into the FMS. The FMS had computed the figure from the zero fuel weight of the aircraft, which had been correctly entered, and added the fuel weight as measured by the aircraft.Once fueling was completed, the crew resumed entering the speeds into the FMS. At this stage, the reference speeds calculated by the FMS were no longer shown and the crew tried several times to get them to reappear. Nobody in the crew understood why they had disappeared. The commander and FO once again entered their weights starting with the ZFW without result. Finally, the crew entered the speeds calculated by the performance calculator (V1=143kt, Vr=152kt, V2=156kt). The flaps were set at 5°. While one of the first officers was surprised by the figures he did not question them. The aircraft taxied to runway 26R and commenced takeoff.The rotation was initiated at 154kt. Right after rotation, the crew felt the airplane sink. Five seconds after the start of the rotation, the tail-strike protection activated with maximum authority. The main gear was still in contact with the runway and the pitch established at 9° to avoid a tail strike. 8 seconds after the activation of the tail strike protection, full power was applied and TOGA announced. The airplane was at a height of 16 ft with a pitch of 13° and speed of 189kt. The airplane accelerated brusquely. The commander was concerned about the height and vertical speed. He commanded the gear to be retracted once the vertical speed reached +1500 fpm. The pitch increased to 16° and the aircraft passed the runway end at 172 ft. The stick shaker was not triggered during departure. During climb the crew started analyzing the situation. The error was found when the First Officer and pilot flying rechecked his performance tool. He was relieved of his position when the airplane passed FL200. The crew subsequently discussed a return to base but decided to continue the flight as they felt up to it. After arrival they conducted a walk around to verify there had been no tail strike. They subsequently informed the company and were relieved after the flight. The BEA analysed that the correct performance data for departure would have been: V1=167kt, Vr=175kt, V2=179kt, Flex Temp of 37°C, Flaps 15° and 98.5% N1 thrust, while the crew actually used: V1=143kt, Vr=152kt, V2=156kt, Flex Temp 58°C, Flaps 5° and 89.3%N1. When the crew changed the figures in the FMC following the receipt of the final load sheet, the FMC was not able to calculate V-Speeds for Flaps 5 as for the weight entered flaps 15 would have been necessary. Consequently the message V-SPEEDS UNAVAILABLE was displayed. This should have alerted the crew that there was a problem with the configuration but failed to do so. The BEA reasons that had the FMS displayed speeds for the weight, the crew would likely have noted the difference of more than 20 kts. The BEA analyzed that the way weight figures are calculated and handled during pre-flight procedures does not adequately rule out errors like the sequence of events which led to this incident. It points out that in recent years there have been several similar incidents of which two on the same type where errors of similar magnitude were made. The BEA annotated that there is no system available on the Boeing 777 which alerts the crew to weight discrepancies. The procedures used by Air France to cross check weight entries in the performance tool and the FMS are insufficient. The BEA issued 3 safety recommendations to Air France, one to France's DGCA and two to Boeing.On Jan 22nd 2019 the BEA released their English version of the final report.
A Jetblue Airbus A321-200, registration N929JB performing flight B6-2801 from Fort Lauderdale,FL to Los Angeles,CA (USA) with 133 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Fort Lauderdale's runway 28R when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed after receiving an unusual gear indication. The aircraft stopped safely, the crew advised no assistance was needed and they would return to the apron. The aircraft taxied to the apron.A replacement Airbus A320-200 registration N556JB reached Los Angeles with a delay of 5 hours.The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground for about 24 hours, then departed for the next day's flight B6-2801.
A Jetstar Airbus A321-200, registration VH-VWT performing flight JQ-976 from Melbourne,VI to Perth,WA (Australia), was accelerating for takeoff from Melbourne's runway 16 when the crew needed to apply nearly full back pressure on the side stick to rotate the aircraft. The aircraft climbed out to safety, the flight crew requested cabin crew to count the passengers on board and note down their seat distribution. The results were recalculated and the flight crew found, that the aircraft had been outside the aircraft's loading limits. The passengers were redistributed within the cabin to bring the center of gravity back into the aircraft's envelope. The flight continued to Perth for a safe landing.On Dec 3rd 2015 Australia's TSB rated the occurrence a serious incident and opened an investigation, the final report is being estimated for October 2016.On Jan 18th 2019 the ATSB reported that the investigation was discontinued. The ATSB argued that the organisational context within the operator had changed significantly in the last 3 years and any finding would thus no longer match the current situation.In the event summary the ATSB stated: "It was later established that passenger seating allocations had been determined using the seat map for an A320 instead of an A321." After reseating 6 passengers to the aft cabin the crew recomputed weight and balance and proceeded for an uneventful remainder of the flight.
An Emirates Boeing 777-300, registration A6-EBR performing flight EK-928 from Cairo (Egypt) to Dubai (United Arab Emirates) with 364 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Cairo's runway 05L when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 130 knots over ground) after spotting a vehicle on the runway. The aircraft slowed safely and stopped on the runway about 1650 meters down the runway and about 100 meters short of the vehicle, the crew commented they almost hit the car, a number of tyres deflated as result.Following the occurrence tower dispatched a follow me vehicle to check out the vehicle on the runway and how it got onto the runway. The vehicle was identified as the vehicle of an electrical maintenance engineer, operating without VHF radio and transponder being on the runway without required guidance by a follow me vehicle. Tower told the crew the vehicle made a runway incursion without a driver in it. In the meantime the crew requested emergency services to attend to the aircraft reporting they had hot brakes and were unable to taxi due to the hot brakes, subsequently reporting they were unable to taxi all the way to the terminal due to deflated tyres, they were able to vacate the runway and stop at a remote stand.The aircraft was able to taxi off the runway to a remote stand with emergency services in trail about 20 minutes after the rejected takeoff. The passengers disembarked at the remote stand and were bussed to the terminal.A passenger reported the aircraft was already at high speed when the brakes came on very hard. After the aircraft stopped the captain announced a number of tyres had deflated as result of the rejected takeoff, a vehicle had apparently attempted to cross the runway. Later he announced the aircraft was unable to perform the flight, a replacement aircraft was flown in to perform the flight. The captain added that the vehicle had not been crossing the runway, it had been left on the runway unattended.Egypt's Authorities opened an investigation into the occurrence.The airline reported the aircraft needed to reject takeoff at high speed due to a vehicle on the runway, a number of tyres were damaged as result. The passengers disembarked, a replacement aircraft was dispatched and departed Cairo with a delay of more than 8 hours. Authorities are investigating.A replacement Boeing 777-300 registration A6-ENX positioned to Cairo as flight EK-2619, resumed flight EK-928 and reached Dubai with a delay of 8.5 hours.
A SAS Scandinavian Airlines Boeing 737-800, registration LN-RRU performing flight SK-1323 from Alesund to Oslo (Norway), departed Alesund's runway 06 when the tail of the aircraft contacted the runway surface. The crew continued takeoff, stopped the climb at about 6500 feet and diverted to Trondheim (Norway) where the aircraft landed safely on runway 27 about 45 minutes after departure.The tail strike was described as soft, consequently the damage to the aircraft is being described as minor.The aircraft was inspected over night, the damage was limited to some scratches on the tail skid assembly, the aircraft was returned to service the following morning after about 13 hours on the ground.Metars:ENAL 131750Z 32017G27KT 9999 -RASN FEW021 BKN031 M00/M06 Q0989=ENAL 131720Z 33020G30KT 9999 FEW021 BKN031 M00/M05 Q0989=ENAL 131650Z 31014KT 9999 FEW005 SCT012 BKN022 M01/M03 Q0989=COR ENAL 131620Z 31021KT 4000 SHSN FEW010 SCT026 BKN036 M00/M05 Q0989=ENAL 131550Z 31017KT 9999 VCSH FEW009 SCT019TCU BKN028 M00/M05 Q0989=ENAL 131520Z 32015KT 9999 VCSH FEW009 SCT019 BKN028 M00/M04 Q0989 RESHSG=ENAL 131450Z 32015KT 9999 SCT030 BKN035 00/M07 Q0989=ENAL 131420Z 33011KT 290V010 9999 FEW023 SCT074 01/M05 Q0988=ENAL 131350Z 32014KT 290V350 9999 FEW023 SCT046 BKN068 00/M04 Q0988=ENAL 131250Z 33013G25KT 300V360 9999 -SHSNRA SCT014TCU BKN023 00/M02 Q0988
An Air Transat Boeing 737-800, registration C-GZEH performing flight TS-41 from Paris Orly (France) to Toronto,ON (Canada) with 2 crew, was initiating the takeoff run from Orly with the crew adjusting power to set TOGA when thick white smoke appeared in the cockpit prompting the crew to reject takeoff, the smoke dissipated as soon as the power levers were brought to idle. The aircraft vacated the runway and returned to the apron.The Canadian TSB reported the aircraft (MSN 2615, former tail number F-GZHE) was on its very first flight for Air Transat and was positioning to Toronto for delivery. The previous operator's maintenance had prepared the aircraft but had overserviced the engine oil levels of both engines. Both engine oil reservoirs were drained in accordance with the aircraft maintenance manuals and an idle run leak check was completed with no anomaly. 
A THY Turkish Airlines Airbus A330-300, registration TC-JNK performing flight TK-43 from Johannesburg (South Africa) to Istanbul (Turkey), was accelerating for takeoff from Johannesburg's runway 21R when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 130 knots over ground) due to an open cockpit window. The aircraft slowed safely, the crew declined assistance offered by tower, stopped briefly on the runway, then vacated the runway via taxiway H about 2000 meters/6600 feet down the runway and returned to the apron.A passenger reported the aircraft sustained a blown tyre and some damage to the landing gear. The passengers were taken to hotels.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Johannesburg about 18 hours after the rejected takeoff.
A Cathay Pacific Boeing 777-300, registration B-KQB performing flight CX-829 from Toronto,ON (Canada) to Hong Kong (China), was accelerating for takeoff from Toronto's runway 23 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed reporting they believed a tyre problem. Tower advised he believed something flew away from the left hand side of the aircraft. Another flight crew near runway 23 reported they believed it was a compressor stall (engine GE90) on the left hand side, tower replied he thought something like this too. The Boeing 777 vacated the runway onto runway 15L about 680 meters down runway 23. A runway 23 inspection did not find any debris on the runway. The aircraft returned to the apron.The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground for about 41 hours, then departed for the flight CX-829D to Hong Kong.A passenger reported he watched the takeoff on his monitor of the inflight entertainment system when he heard a loud bang about estimated 15 seconds after the takeoff began, a small white flash occurred at the left hand side of the screen, the aircraft jolted slightly to the left, the brakes came on and the aircraft stopped about 10 seconds later. The aircraft remained on the runway (editorial note: on runway 15L) for about 15 minutes, then taxied to the apron. The passengers were hinted the engine needed a borescopic inspection causing the cancellation of the flight.
An Ural Airlines Airbus A321-200, registration VQ-BCE performing flight U6-9785 from Ufa to Nizhnevartovsk (Russia) with 165 people on board, departed Ufa's runway 32L, the tail however contacted the runway surface. The crew continued takeoff and climbed to cruise FL350. About 40 minutes after departure, 270nm northeast of Ufa and about 60nm northeast of Ekaterinburg, the crew decided to divert to Ekaterinburg, turned the aircraft around and landed safely on Ekaterinburg's runway 26R about one hour after departure.The airline reported the commander felt a strong impact of the tail with the runway on departure. The flight was aborted and the aircraft diverted to the nearest maintenance base.A replacement A321-200 registration VQ-BOC reached Nizhnevartovsk with a delay of about 15.5 hours.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground about 18 hours after landing.Metars:UWUU 140230Z 35002MPS 3000 0400N PRFG BR NSC M08/M09 Q1025 R32L/0///60 TEMPO 0300 FZFG VV003 RMK QFE756/1008=UWUU 140200Z 33002MPS 300V360 3000 BR NSC M07/M08 Q1025 R32L/0///60 TEMPO 0300 FZFG VV003 RMK QFE756/1008=UWUU 140130Z VRB01MPS 4500 BR NSC M07/M08 Q1025 R32L/0///60 TEMPO 0300 FZFG VV003 RMK QFE756/1008=UWUU 140100Z 33002MPS CAVOK M08/M09 Q1025 R32L/0///60 NOSIG RMK QFE756/1008=UWUU 140030Z 35002MPS CAVOK M08/M08 Q1025 R32L/0///60 NOSIG RMK QFE756/1008=UWUU 140000Z 34002MPS CAVOK M07/M07 Q1025 R32L/0///60 NOSIG RMK QFE756/1009=UWUU 132330Z VRB01MPS CAVOK M07/M08 Q1025 R32L/0///60 NOSIG RMK QFE756/1008=UWUU 132300Z VRB01MPS CAVOK M05/M06 Q1025 R32L/0///60 NOSIG RMK QFE756/1009=UWUU 132230Z VRB01MPS CAVOK M06/M07 Q1025 R32L/0///60 NOSIG RMK QFE756/1008=UWUU 132200Z 01002MPS CAVOK M06/M08 Q1025 R32L/0///60 NOSIG RMK QFE756/1008=UWUU 132130Z 36001MPS CAVOK M04/M06 Q1025 R32L/0///60 NOSIG RMK QFE756/1009=UWUU 132100Z 03002MPS 9999 SCT040 M02/M06 Q1025 R32L/0///60 NOSIG RMK QFE756/1009=UWUU 132030Z 01002MPS 9999 SCT040 M03/M06 Q1025 R32L/0///60 NOSIG RMK QFE756/1009=UWUU 132000Z 35001MPS 9999 SCT040 M03/M06 Q1025 R32L/0///60 NOSIG RMK QFE757/1009=
A SAS Scandinavian Airlines Boeing 737-700, registration LN-RPJ performing flight SK-4023 from Oslo to Stavanger (Norway), was accelerating for takeoff from Oslo's runway 01L when the crew rejected takeoff due to an engine failure (CFM56). The aircraft returned to the apron.The airline confirmed the crew received indication of a technical malfunction causing an engine to fail.A replacement Boeing 737-700 registration LN-TUK reached Stavanger with a delay of 90 minutes.
A Cavok Air Antonov AN-74TK-100, registration UR-CKC performing a flight from Sao Tome (Sao Tome and Principe) to Accra (Ghana) with 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Sao Tome's runway 29 when the left hand engine (D36) ingested a number of birds prompting the crew to reject takeoff. The aircraft overran the end of the runway and went down a slope before coming to a stop on soft ground. One crew member received injuries, the aircraft received substantial damage beyond repair.Ukraine's Deputy Minister of Infrastructure Yuri Lavrenyuk reported the flight was attempting takeoff when according to preliminary information the right hand engine received a bird strike, the takeoff was rejected, the aircraft went past the runway end. All crew members received injuries.Sao Tome's Civil Aviation Authority reported the aircraft rejected takeoff for some problem at about 11:00L (11:00Z) and suffered an accident. Five of the six people on board received injuries, one of them needed surgical treatment. The aircraft suffered substantial damage. An accident investigation commission has been formed.The occurrence aircraft had operated to Sao Tome on Jul 27th 2017 from Stavanger (Norway) via Luxembourg (Luxembourg) and Ghardaia (Algeria) and was presumably departing for the return flight.On Aug 18th 2017 Ukraine's NBAAI reported in their monthly bulletin, that the aircraft was accelerating for takeoff, when the aircraft rolled through a flock of birds causing both engines to fail. The crew rejected takeoff but was not able to stop the aircraft within the runway. All five crew members received injuries, the aircraft sustained substantial damage. The occurrence was rated an accident. The NBAAI have joined the investigation led by Sao Tome.On Aug 17th 2018 Nigeria's AIB released an interim statement reporting the aircraft was about to depart for the return flight via Ghardaia and Luxembourg to Stavanger, however, was first planned to perform a tech stop at Accra (Ghana). The captain, first officer, flight engineer and two maintenance engineers on board remained unhurt, the flight navigator received injuries to his left foot and some minor bruises. A draft final report has already been sent out, comments and responses are due in 60 days.On Dec 6th 2018 Nigeria's AIB released their final report concluding the probable causes of the accident were:Causal FactorThe investigation determines that the cause of this accident as:Due to the presence of birds on the runway, the take-off was rejected at a speed above decision speed V1, which is inconsistent with CAVOKs Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).Contributory factorsThe contributory factors to this accident include but are not limited to the following:- Failure of the crew to deploy interceptors (speed brakes/spoilers).- Inadequate flight crew training on details of rejected take-off procedure scenarios.- The omission of the take-off briefing in CAVOKs Normal Operations checklist.- Poor Crew Resource Management (CRM), especially in a multi-crew flight operation.The AIB reported an engine examination by the manufacturer found feathers inside the left engine which could be matched to a dead bird on the runway. The AIB wrote in the analysis: "It might have penetrated into the left engine as a result of being overtaken by the aircraft from behind on take-off during which part of its left feather was pulled out."The AIB analysed:According to the Captain, he saw five to six eagles get off the ground of the runway which flew dangerously close to the aircraft at the beginning of the take-off roll. At a speed of 180km/h, the crew asserted that they saw ahead of them a flock of eagles which were not seen initially getting off the ground from the runway....The Captain took control of the aircraft and requested the Flight Engineer to check if the landing lights were ON and to monitor the engine parameters. The Captain further stated that he assessed the situation within 4 - 5 seconds and decided that the best option for the crew was to abort the take-off. The Captain immediately initiated a rejected take-off, instructing the Flight Engineer to apply the thrust reversers. The rejected take-off was initiated at a speed of 220 km/h, about 5 seconds after sighting the birds.The decision not to continue the take-off could have been made when the flight crew observed that the runway surface appeared to be rising as the aircraft was accelerating towards the take-off speed, before they sighted the flock of birds. The investigator believes that the pilot intended to continue the take-off despite the birds seen and the runway factor.According to the post investigation report received from Antonov State Enterprise Company, the pilot in command of the aircraft deliberately decided to abort the take-off at the speed exceeding the take-off decision speed V1, which was followed by the runway overrun, since an aircraft overrun during the take-off is obviously less dangerous than an aircraft impact at failure of two engines at the initial stage of the climb. Thus, the pilot's actions were motivated by a state of emergency and aimed at minimizing the consequences of the occurrence.However, the Captain was hesitant on the decision to discontinue the take-off. This resulted in a delayed and inappropriate response to the situation. At that time, the aircraft rotation speed was attained, the captain called for rotation initially then he reversed his rotation call out and instructed the first officer not to rotate. At about 5 seconds after Vr (200 km/h), with the fear of losing multiple engines, the Captain was certain that a reject was imminent; he took control, initiated a rejected take-off and called for reversers at a speed in excess of V1 (20 km/h > V1) which is inconsistent with CAVOKs SOP and AN-74TK-100 Airplane Flight Manual (AFM).The braking action was initiated by the Captain at a time lead of 2 seconds as against the activation of the reversers by the Flight Engineer (FE) after the captains instruction. This delay in activation of the reversers resulted in the reduction of the braking effectiveness, hence increasing the unlikelihood of the aircraft stopping before the end of the runway.During the cockpit examination following the accident, the investigators found the SPEED BRAKE/SPOILERS lever in the down detent position. This position would normally not deploy the system manually or automatically should the thrust lever be retarded to idle. Also, FDR data recordings did not physically indicate the deployment activation of speed brake/spoilers. The failure of the flight crew to activate the speed brake/spoilers during the reject procedures also increased the severity of the accident as a result of decreased effectiveness in slowing the speed of the aircraft within the shortest practicable distance. Had the flight crew used the speed brake/spoilers, it would have assisted considerably in slowing down the aircraft, therefore stopping capability would be enhanced and braking effectiveness would increase; enabling the crew to stop the aircraft before the end of the runway and also to achieve a successful rejected take-off (See Figure 15).The AIB analysed:Even with the delayed and moderate braking, and use of spoilers and speed brakes, the aircraft should have been brought to a full stop within the confines of the runway, if the RTO was initiated by V1. The combination of the reduced braking effectiveness and RTO initiation speed resulted in the runway excursion.Metars:FPST 291300Z 18013KT 9999 FEW020 OVC040 26/21 Q1014 NOSIG=FPST 291200Z 23004KT 9999 FEW020 OVC040 28/21 Q1014 NOSIG=FPST 291000Z 14013KT 9999 FEW025 SCT040 27/21 Q1015 NOSIG=FPST 290800Z 17004KT 9999 SCT025 25/20 Q1016 NOSIG=FPST 290700Z 16006KT 9999 FEW025 BKN110 24/21 Q1015 NOSIG=UR-CKC past the runway 29 end (Photos: Yuri Lavrenyuk):Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):
A Flydubai Boeing 737-800, registration A6-FEQ performing flight FZ-918 from Moscow Sheremetyevo (Russia) to Dubai (United Arab Emirates), commenced takeoff from runway 06R without takeoff clearance, tower instructed the aircraft to reject takeoff, the crew complied and rejected takeoff. The aircraft vacated the runway about 1700 meters/5700 feet down the runway and returned to the apron.The aircraft departed about 2.5 hours later and reached Dubai with a delay of 3:15 hours.Russia's Air Traffic Control Organisation reported the aircraft commenced takeoff without clearance and stopped following an according instruction by tower. The crew requested to return to the apron. The aircraft was able to depart about 2.5 hours later following an interview of the crew.
An Air Canada Airbus A320-200, registration C-FFWI performing flight AC-296 from Vancouver,BC to Winnipeg,MB (Canada) with 107 passengers and 5 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Vancouver's runway 26L when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (120 KIAS) due to the failure of the left hand engine (CFM56). The aircraft slowed, the crew declared PAN, emergency services responded. The aircraft came to a stop on the runway, the crew shut the left hand engine down, emergency services reported both left main tyres were deflated. The passengers disembarked onto the runway via stairs and were bussed to the terminal. On Nov 28th 2018 the Canadian TSB reported maintenance found bird remains in the left hand engine. The bird was identified as a Great Blue Heron. The engine sustained damage to the compressor and was replaced.
A Jet Airways Boeing 737-800, registration VT-JBG performing flight 9W-2374 from Goa to Mumbai (India) with 154 passengers and 7 crew, backtracked runway 26, lined up runway 26 and was accelerating the engines for takeoff when the aircraft continued to turn right, the crew rejected takeoff, the aircraft went off the right runway edge almost perpendicular, went over soft ground and across a road and came to a stop with the nose gear collapsed and both engines making ground contact. The aircraft was evacuated, 16 occupants received minor injuries as result of the evacuation.The airline reported due to a technical glitch the aircraft spun nearly 360 degrees while aligning the runway for takeoff, few passengers received minor injuries during the evacuation.The airport reported 15 occupants received minor injuries.India's AAIB have opened an investigation and dispatched 3 investigators on site.On Nov 26th 2018 India's AAIB released their final report concluding the probable cause of the accident was:The PIC pressed TOGA when the thrust on no.1 engine was 40% and no.2 engine was 28% in deviation from SOP, which caused the No.1 engine thrust to increase at a faster rate than no.2 resulting in aircraft yawing towards right. In the absence of timely desired corrective actions including reject takeoff, the aircraft veered off the runway and continued to move in a semicircular arc on the undulated ground resulting in substantial damages to the aircraft.The AAIB reported the crew had prepared for a flaps 5 departure, V1 had been computed at 135 KIAS, Vr at 141 KIAS and V2 at 146 KIAS. The aircraft backtracked runway 26, turned around 180 degrees to line up for departure on runway 26, when the captain pressed TOGA with the left engine still at 40% N1 and the right engine at 28% N1. As soon as the engines began to accelerate the aircraft drifted off the right and departed the paved surface within 10-12 seconds after pressing TOGA. Due to heavy bumps the crew was unable to control the aircraft despite applying full left rudder, asymmetric brakes and nose wheel steering. The aircraft impacted PAPI lights and contacted a concrete piller 92.3 meters abeam the runway center line.The aircraft sustained substantial damage including the nose gear olea buried underneath the aircraft nose, both engines, left hand engine pylon fractured, left hand fuselage. 16 people received minor injuries as result of the evacuation.The captain (36, ATPL, 5,741 hours total, 491 hours on type) was pilot flying, the first officer (33, CPL, 723 hours total, 472 hours on type) was pilot monitoring.The AAIB analysed:Runway heading for Goa runway 26 is 261. The reference take-off N1 is 95.7%. The aircraft heading on line-up was 256 and TOGA was pressed at 23:33:17.During the twelve second period from 23:33:05 to 23:33:17 both the thrust levers were advanced for take-off. The throttle resolver angle increased from idle thrust position which is 36/36and reached the position of 45/47. During this period the left brake pressure indicates 252psi and the right brake pressure 38psi.The rudder position is neutral.At time 23:33:17, the N1 parameters on both engines are not symmetrical. The fuel flow on both engines has a difference of 400lbs/hr. Fuel flow for number one engine is higher as the thrust produced by number one engine is higher. The application of thrust for takeoff is not as per the Jet Airways documented procedure for take-off which states that both thrust levers must be advanced till the N1 displayed is 40% and then TOGA must be pushed.The asymmetry in the thrust setting prior to TOGA application caused the number one engine to increase thrust at a faster rate than the number 2 engine.From time 23:33:17 to 23:33:34, as the thrust was increased there was an increase in heading from 257 to 270. There was left rudder application and constant left brake application. During this period at 23:33:20 the number 2 engine thrust increased but was lagging behind the number one engine by 46%. After a second, the number 2 engine thrust further increased but was lagging behind the number one engine by 47%. This was the maximum value in the difference of the N1 parameter between both the engines. 03 seconds later, the reference N1 was reached on number one engine and the number two engine was at 89%.During this period it can also be seen that at 23:33:25, number 2 thrust lever is moved to the idle position. There is a continuous increase in heading and constant application of the left brake. The heading increases by 34 degrees in a period of 8 seconds. When the no. 2 thrust lever is moved to idle then there is decrease in EGT, fuel flow and N1. The values consistently reduce in the period of 8 seconds. The rudder had a fixed value indicating left deflection.2 seconds later, auto-throttle is disconnected followed by an increase in right brake application. At 23:33:31, the aircraft has a ground speed of 47kts which was the maximum value of the ground speed during the accident. For 2 seconds at this point, there is an increase in application of brake pressure on both the brakes.As can be seen the procedure for reject take-off was not as per the Boeing procedure for reject take-off.At 23:33:34, there was an increase in the number one TLA by one degree and this caused the N1 to increase. There is an increase in the fuel and EGT of the number one engine. The number two engine thrust lever was at the idle position with reduction in fuel flow and EGT. The ground speed of the aircraft accordingly was reducing. The maximum value of left brake pressure recorded during the accident was 1915. The rudder position showed left deflection. Thereafter for two seconds the engine parameters of the number one engine increased though the ground speed of the aircraft reduced. At 23:33:37, there was an increase in the TLA of the number one engine by one degree and this caused the N1 to increase. The initiation of the reverse thrust for the number two engine began as there was change in the TLA. The ground speed of the aircraft continued to reduce. After 2 seconds, again there was an increase in the TLA of the number one engine by three degrees which further caused the N1 to increase. A second later TLA of the number one engine was further increased by one degree which caused the N1 to increase further. The N1 for number one engine reached 102% which was the maximum value recorded during the accident. During this period the number two engine reverse thrust sleeve was still getting deployed. EGT and fuel flow for the number two engine continued to reduce with reduction in the ground speed of the aircraft. At 23:33:43, both start levers were moved to cut-off position and the DFDR had also stopped recording.The CVR recording was downloaded and heard by the Committee. During the line up the aircraft was aligned on a heading of 256. The visual cross-check was carried out by the captain as the centre line markings passed thru the aircraft nose. The PIC did not allow the engine to stabilize as documented in the standard operating procedures prior to pressing TOGA.TOGA was pressed with the number one engine at 40% and the number two engine at 28%. Correlating the above DFDR analysis with the CVR, the PIC had a very small time frame to decide to reject to take-off. During the period of 23:33:34 till 23:33:42 the CVR clearly indicates that the PIC was not effective in controlling the aircraft. Increase in the TLA of the number one engine during this period was probably due to the fact that the aircraft was travelling over a rough surface and the PIC though tried to close the thrust levers but inadvertently moved number one forward thereby increasing the N1 on the number one engine.DFDR data also indicates that as the aircraft started turning to the right during the take-off procedure PIC tried to correct it with the application of left brake. This is indicated by continuous left brake application during the take-off roll. During the entire phase of flight the speed-brakes lever was in the down detent.Metars:VOGO 270100Z 07008KT 4000 BR NSC 21/20 Q1010 BECMG 5000 BR=VOGO 270000Z 06004KT 3000 BR NSC 21/20 Q1010 TEMPO 2000 BR=VOGO 262330Z VRB03KT 4000 BR NSC 21/20 Q1010 BECMG 3000 HZ/BR=VOGO 262300Z VRB02KT 4000 BR NSC 22/21 Q1010 BECMG 3000 HZ/BR=VOGO 262200Z VRB03KT 4000 BR NSC 23/21 Q1010 BECMG 3000 BR=Aerial overview of VT-JBG in its final position (Photos: India's AAIB):VT-JBG in its final position (Photos: Indian Navy):Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):
A KLM Boeing 777-200, registration PH-BQC performing flight KL-641 from Amsterdam (Netherlands) to New York JFK,NY (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Amsterdam's runway 36L when the right hand engine (GE90) surged prompting the crew to reject takeoff at low speed (about 70 knots over ground). The aircraft slowed safely and stopped on the runway about 1000 meters/3300 feet down the runway. The crew advised they had no fire indication, just a high temperature indication, they were able to vacate the runway and hold on the taxiway. A runway inspection found no debris on the runway. The aircraft taxied to the apron.The flight was cancelled.
An American Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8, registration N306RC performing flight AA-2666 from Boston,MA to Miami,FL (USA) with 172 passengers and 6 crew, was climbing out of Boston's runway 22L when the crew reported they thought they had a bird strike on takeoff and wanted to come back. After being handed off to departure the crew reported the bird strike was probably into the right hand engine (LEAP). The aircraft returned to Boston for a safe landing on runway 22L about 10 minutes after departure.A replacement Boeing 737-800 registration N200NV reached Miami with a delay of 2.5 hours.https://flightaware.com/live/flight/AAL2666/history/20181124/1222Z/KBOS/KMIA
An Easyjet Europe Airbus A320-200, registration OE-IZV performing flight U2-2760 from Barcelona,SP (Spain) to Milan Malpensa (Italy), was accelerating for takeoff from Barcelona's runway 07R when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 90 knots over ground) due to an engine (CFM56) malfunction. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.A replacement A320-200 registration G-EZOA reached Milan with a delay of about 2 hours.The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground for 24 hours and departed to Milan for flight U2-2760 the following day.
A Sunwing Airlines Boeing 737-800 on behalf of Thomson Airways, registration C-FWGH performing flight BY-1526 from Belfast Aldergrove,NI (UK) to Kerkyra (Greece) with 186 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Belfast's runway 07 when the crew detected problems with the acceleration of the aircraft and re-selected TOGA prior to beginning takeoff rotation. During the initial climb the crew selected max continuous thrust and power adjusted accordingly. ATC reported the aircraft had an unusually long takeoff run. The aircraft continued the flight and landed in Kerkyra without further incident.The Canadian TSB reported that a runway inspection found an approach light for runway 25 bent over. The aircraft was inspected at Kerkyra with no damage found. The UK AAIB have opened an investigation into the occurrence.The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground in Kerkyra (also known as Corfu) for about 90 minutes, then departed for the return flight BY-1527.On Sep 20th 2017 the AAIB released a special bulletin stating:"On 21 July 2017 at 1539 hrs, C-FWGH took off from Belfast International Airport with a thrust setting which was significantly below that required for the conditions of the day. Preliminary evidence indicated that, after the aircraft lifted off from the runway, one of the aircraft tyres struck a runway approach light, which was 35 cm high and 29 m beyond the end of the runway."The AAIB reported that neither UK's Civil Aviation Authority not the AAIB had been informed about the occurrence by captain, operator or tour operator although the Canadian TSB had been informed about the occurrence. ATC filed a Mandatory Occurrence Report which was not read by the AAIB until Jul 24th, as result the data off the flight fata and cockpit voice recorders were not available to the investigation as the aircraft had flown 16 sectors in the meantime and the data of the occurrence flight on both flight data and cockpit voice recorders were overwritten.The AAIB reported: "The crew were cleared for takeoff on Runway 07 from Taxiway D (Figure 1), which gave a Takeoff Run Available (TORA) of 2,654 m. During the takeoff, at around 120 to 130 kt, the crew realised that the aircraft was not accelerating normally. They estimated, during post-flight interviews, that they reached V1 1 with around 900 m of the runway remaining and rotated shortly afterwards. The aircraft was seen, by multiple witnesses, during rotation and took a significant time to lift off before climbing at a very shallow angle. ... After takeoff, the crew checked the aircrafts FMC which showed that an N1 of 81.5% had been used for the takeoff. This figure was significantly below the required N1 setting of 93.3% calculated by the operator and shown on the pre-flight paperwork."With respect to N1 settings the AAIB reported:Passing the upwind end of the runway the aircrafts ACARS sent a takeoff report, which confirmed that the engines were at an N1 of approximately 81.5%. Other ACARS messages confirmed that the correct weights for the aircraft had been entered into the FMC.The aircrafts auto-throttle BITE8 history showed two messages generated during the climbout. Both messages were consistent with the crew having manually advanced each throttle to a power setting above an N1 of 81.5% when the aircraft was approximately 800 ft aal.The Electronic Flight Bags (EFB) used by the crew to calculate the performance figures for entry into the FMC were provided to the AAIB. Initial examination of these devices indicated that the correct figures were calculated by the EFB performance software prior to the aircrafts departure.The AAIB conducted simulator tests to find out whether the aircraft would be able to climb out or stop in case of an engine failure and how such a performance of N1=81.5% could occur in the FMS. The AAIB wrote:The AAIB and operator carried out independent assessments of how the incorrect thrust setting might have been programmed into the FMC. Both assessments concluded that the only credible way to achieve a grossly low N1 setting was to enter an extremely low value into the outside air temperature (OAT) field on the n1 limit page. It was found that the takeoff N1 setting used on the flight (81.5%) would be calculated by the FMC if:a. The expected top-of-climb outside air temperature (OAT) was entered into the OAT field on the n1 limit page instead of the OAT at the airport (a figure of - 52°C as opposed to +16°C); and b. The correct assumed temperature9 of 48°C was entered into the FMC. No other combination of data entries was found which would achieve the same result.During the simulation carried out by the AAIB, the aircrafts performance was assessed following an engine failure immediately prior to V1, with the pilot making a decision by V1 to either abandon or continue the takeoff. In the simulator, the aircraft was able to stop in the runway remaining following a decision to abandon the takeoff, but was unable to climb away safely following a decision to continue the takeoff.The AAIB analysed:The aircraft took off from Runway 07 with a thrust setting significantly below that required to achieve the correct takeoff performance, and struck a Runway 25 approach light shortly after lifting off.The N1 required to achieve the required takeoff performance was 93.3% but 81.5% was used instead. Independent assessments by the AAIB and operator showed that the only credible way for this to have happened was for an error to have been made whilst entering the OAT into the FMC. If the top-of-climb OAT was mistakenly inserted into the OAT field on the n1 limit page (a figure of -52°C as opposed to +16°C), and the correct assumed temperature of 48°C was entered, the FMC would have calculated a target takeoff N1 of 81.5%. The investigation will consider how such a data entry error could have been made, and whether actual aircraft performance matched that which would be expected given the N1 power setting used.The AAIB released two safety recommendations as result of the investigation so far:It is recommended that the Federal Aviation Administration, mandate the use of Flight Management Computer software revision U12.0, or later revision incorporating the outside air temperature crosscheck, for operators of Boeing 737 Next Generation aircraft.andIt is recommended that The Boeing Company promulgates to all 737 operators the information contained within this Special Bulletin and reminds them of previous similar occurrences reported in the Boeing 737 Flight Crew Operations Manual Bulletin dated December 2014.On Nov 21st 2018 the AAIB released their final report concluding the probable causes of the serious incident were:Causal factors- An incorrect OAT was entered into the FMC, which caused the FMC to calculate an N1 setting for takeoff which was significantly below that required for the aircraft weight and environmental conditions.- The incorrect OAT was not identified subsequently by the operating crew.- The abnormal acceleration during the takeoff run was not identified until the aircraft was rapidly approaching the end of the runway, and no action was taken to either reject the takeoff or increase engine thrust.Contributory factors- The aircrafts FMC did not have the capability to alert the flight crew to the fact that they had entered the incorrect OAT into the FMC, although this capability existed in a later FMC software standard available at the time.- The Electronic Flight Bags did not display N1 on their performance application (some applications do), which meant that the crew could not verify the FMC-calculated N1 against an independently-calculated value.- The crew were unlikely to detect the abnormally low acceleration because of normal limitations in human performance.The AAIB analysed human factors:The human factors analysis in Appendix B suggested that the crew in this serious incident were unlikely to have sensed the abnormal takeoff acceleration. The physical limitations of the human sensory system mean that it is very hard for pilots to distinguish the difference between the acceleration of a normal takeoff and that experienced by the crew in this serious incident. Neither the vestibular system nor the visual system were likely to have been able to detect the difference in acceleration. This, combined with the pilots unfamiliarity with BFS Runway 07, meant that there was little or no context for the pilots to compare this takeoff with others previously experienced. It was only in the last 900 m of the runway, with the change in centreline light colours and the rapidly approaching runway end, that the crew was alerted that something was wrong.Cockpit instrumentation did not show anything to the crew during the takeoff roll which was likely to have alerted them to the abnormal acceleration. For the crew, the indications displayed were similar to every other normal takeoff and it would have been extremely difficult to perceive any abnormality from the information displayed.The response of the crew to the rapidly approaching runway end was the same as could be expected from many crews. They found themselves in a time critical situation but one for which they had no obvious explanation. Pilots are trained to make decisions based on evidence and review rather than reaction, with rapid action in ambiguous circumstances discouraged. Their training would have discouraged them from moving the thrust levers after V1 and they had no experience of moving the thrust levers to a higher power setting during a derated takeoff. Natural human reaction not to accelerate towards perceived danger may also have made increasing the thrust counter-intuitive as the end of the runway approached.The acceleration clues in this case were unlikely to have alerted the pilots that there was a problem until the visual clues of the approaching runway end became apparent. Once they realised that there was an issue, their reactions in not increasing thrust were the same as could be expected from many crews.With respect to the Electronic Flight Bag the AAIB analysed:The EFB used to calculate the takeoff data complied with the Canadian AMC document and was approved for use as a performance tool. However, there was no requirement to display the calculated N1, the parameter which defines each engines thrust and, therefore, determines the aircrafts ability to meet takeoff performance requirements. Had N1 been displayed on the EFB, it would have allowed the pilots to crosscheck the value of N1 calculated by the FMC. Had they done so, they would have noticed the significant difference between the two calculated figures and investigated the discrepancy, and this would have probably prevented this serious incident. However, whilst the aircraft manufacturer required the crews to verify the N1, there was no specified procedure to do so.An N1 crosscheck would also highlight other errors that have caused serious incidents and accidents, including selecting the wrong fixed derate and entering an incorrect assumed temperature. Such errors would not be picked up by the automated OAT crosscheck which would only identify erroneous OAT entries. However, the errors would lead to a discrepancy between the EFB‑and FMC-calculated N1 and, if the N1 figures were crosschecked by the crew, there would be an opportunity for these additional types of errors to be picked up and corrected before they led to an incident or accident. For aircraft not equipped with EFBs, a crosscheck of FMC-calculated N1 against an alternative, independently-calculated value would increase the likelihood of identifying the error.Metars:EGAA 211650Z 12014KT 9999 SCT026 16/11 Q1000=EGAA 211620Z 12015KT 9999 FEW027 SCT033 15/10 Q1000=EGAA 211550Z 12015KT 9999 SCT024 15/10 Q1000=EGAA 211520Z 13013KT 9999 FEW024 SCT030 16/11 Q0999=EGAA 211450Z 13014KT 9999 SCT025 15/10 Q0999=EGAA 211420Z 13014KT 9999 SCT025 15/10 Q0999=EGAA 211350Z 13016KT 9999 FEW023 SCT028 15/10 Q0999=EGAA 211320Z 13016KT 9999 FEW021 SCT027 15/11 Q0999=EGAA 211250Z 13015KT 9999 SCT026 15/10 Q0998=EGAA 211220Z 14014KT 100V160 9999 SCT024 16/10 Q0998=EGAA 211150Z 13016G28KT 9999 SCT022 17/12 Q0998=EGAA 211120Z 12016KT 100V160 9999 FEW021 SCT027 17/12 Q0997=
A Flydubai Boeing 737-800, registration A6-FEU performing flight FZ-724 from Odessa (Ukraine) to Dubai (United Arab Emirates), was accelerating for takeoff from Odessa's runway 16 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed. The aircraft came to a stop about 1000 meters/3300 feet down the runway. Smoke was observed from the aircraft, emergency services responded.Ukraine National Police in Odessa reported an investigate task force has been dispatched on site. It was determined that the smoke originated from the region of the landing gear.On Nov 19th 2018 Ukraine's NBAAI reported the crew rejected takeoff due to a fire indication on the right hand main gear. The passengers disembarked via stairs. The cause of the indication could not be determined.A6-FEU still seen on the runway (Photo: National Police in Odessa):

A Hawaiian Airlines Boeing 717-200, registration N478HA performing flight HA-144 from Lihue,HI to Honolulu,HI (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Lihue's runway 35 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 90 knots over ground) due to an engine (BR715) failure. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The FAA confirmed the aircraft rejected takeoff due to an engine failure.Passengers reported there was a loud bang, then the brakes came on. Some passengers reported they believed the aircraft had already begun rotation for takeoff when the takeoff was rejected (editorial note: when the brakes come on the nose gear has to take additional load during the braking. The aircraft therefore pitches down generating the perceiption the aircraft's nose must have been in the air already and was lowered onto the ground again).
A Thai Airways Airbus A350-900, registration HS-THC performing flight TG-462 from Melbourne,VI (Australia) to Bangkok (Thailand), was accelerating for takeoff from Melbourne's runway 16 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed, vacated the runway via the first high speed turnoff about 1800 meters/5900 feet down the runway and returned to the apron.A passenger reported the flight was already delayed by about 5-6 hours due to an engine (Trent XWB) problem. The aircraft subsequently taxied for departure but needed to reject takeoff and returned to the apron. All about 400 passengers needed to disembark. The aircraft was repaired and departed with about 160 passengers remaining and 27 hours delay.The aircraft was able to depart the following day about 20.5 hours after the rejected takeoff and reached Bangkok with a delay of about 27 hours.
A Piedmont Embraer ERJ-145 on behalf of American Airlines, registration N906AE performing flight PD-4952/AA-4952 from Williamsport,PA to Philadelphia,PA (USA) with 43 passengers and 3 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Williamsport's Lycoming County Airport when the crew rejected takeoff after the aircraft struck a deer on the runway. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The flight was cancelled.The airport reported the aircraft sustained minor damage but needed a thorough check after a striking a deer on the runway. The deer likely had jumped the airport perimeter fence and did not survive the contact with the aircraft.
An Air Algerie Boeing 737-800, registration 7T-VKH performing flight AH-6026 from Algiers to Constantine (Algeria) with 130 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Algiers' runway 27 when an engine (CFM56) emitted a loud bang. The crew continued takeoff, climbed to 3000 feet and returned to Algiers for a safe landing on runway 09 about 10 minutes after departure.The airline reported the engine ingested some "foreign object debris" (FOD) during "taxiing" which forced the aircraft to return to Algiers about 20 minutes after departure. The foreign object debris might include a bird strike as there is migratory season as of current.
A Malaysia Airlines Boeing 737-800, registration 9M-MXM performing flight MH-387 from Shanghai Pudong (China) to Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), was accelerating for takeoff from Pudong's runway 35R when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed due to both left main tyres bursting with pieces of the tyres penetrating the fuselage. The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway via a high speed turn off about 1800 meters/5900 feet down the runway and stopped, emergency services foamed the landing gear. The aircraft sustained substantial damage.The damage:
A Norra Nordic Regional Airlines Avions de Transport Regional ATR-72-212A on behalf of Finnair, registration OH-ATO performing flight AY-1071 from Helsinki (Finland) to Riga (Latvia) with 60 people on board, was cleared for takeoff from runway 22L and began their departure roll when snow removal equipment was still within the runway protected area. The ATR became normally airborne ahead of the position of the snow removal equipment, climbed out normally and continued to Riga for a safe landing.Finland's Onnettomuustutkintakeskus (Safety Investigation Authority Finland SAIF) rated the occurrence a serious incident and opened an investigation. The SAIF reported the snow removal equipment had already moved onto the taxiway but had not yet crossed the hold short line to leave the protected runway area, when the aircraft departed. The aircraft rotated well ahead of the taxiway.On Feb 1st 2018 the SAIF amended their statement: "TWR had earlier cleared three airport maintenance vehicles for snow removal at RWY 22L and its vicinity. TWR cleared FIN3PU for takeoff at RWY 22L when the vehicles still had a valid clearance for snow removal. TWR noticed the situation when FIN3PU was airborne. The precise distance between the vehicles and the aircraft is under investigation."On Oct 17th 2018 the SAIF released their final report in Finnish only (Editorial note: to serve the purpose of global prevention of the repeat of causes leading to an occurrence an additional timely release of all occurrence reports in the only world spanning aviation language English would be necessary, a Finnish only release does not achieve this purpose as set by ICAO annex 13 and just forces many aviators to waste much more time and effort each in trying to understand the circumstances leading to the occurrence. Aviators operating internationally are required to read/speak English besides their local language, investigators need to be able to read/write/speak English to communicate with their counterparts all around the globe). The form and content of the report, mixing up two occurrences and mixing facts, analysis and conclusion into conclusions in addition to the need to translate from Finnish make it impossible to The Aviation Herald to understand the report and create a meaningful summary. Hence we use the brief English abstract provided by the SAIF that does not even mention the conclusions or causes:The Safety Investigation Authority, Finland has completed a safety investigation on the serious incidents that took place at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport on 23 and 24 January 2018. The incidents did not result in any injuries to persons or damage to property or the environment. Safety investigation on serious incidents is done to improve the safety of aviation and to prevent incidents and accidents.In the first incident, on 23 January 2018, the Air Traffic Control (ATC) cleared a business jet to take off from a runway on and around which three runway maintenance vehicles were working. Two tractors and one brush blower were clearing snow off of runway and taxiway lights.In the second incident, on 24 January 2018, a business jet inadvertently taxied onto an active runway for which an airliner on approach was on short final. The ATC noticed the runway incursion from the ground control radar display and ordered the aircraft to stop immediately. In addition, the ATC ordered the approaching airliner to go around.The Safety Investigation Authority issues three safety recommendations to improve safety and to prevent damageThe Safety Investigation Authority recommends that Finavia and ANS Finland handle future violations of the Memorandum of Understanding signed between aerodrome maintenance and the ATC as defects. By doing so they will be properly analysed. In the first incident, which occurred on 23 January 2018, the Memorandum of Understanding for aerodrome maintenance was not followed. Proper anticipation of maintenance operations would have improved safety by reducing sudden distractions in air traffic controlling.Second, the Safety Investigation Authority recommends that ANS Finland and Finavia improve the ATC systems touch screen displays in such a manner that aircraft and land vehicles are clearly distinguishable from each other. In the first incident, which occurred on 23 January 2018, the vehicle strips on the air traffic controllers e-Strip display were not clearly distinguishable from the strips indicating aircraft and runways.In addition, the Safety Investigation Authority recommends that The Finnish Transport Safety Agency, when conducting inspections of operators, ensure that the operators taxiing procedures take into account that flight crews continuously maintain sufficient situational awareness. In the second incident, which occurred on 24 January 2018, the flight crew of the aircraft was concentrating on the before take-off checklist during taxiing, rather than paying sufficient attention to where their aircraft was going.Metars:EFHK 230920Z 29003KT 9999 BKN048 M12/M14 Q1020 NOSIG=EFHK 230850Z 27004KT 9999 BKN046 M12/M14 Q1020 NOSIG=EFHK 230820Z 24004KT 9999 BKN045 M12/M15 Q1020 NOSIG=EFHK 230750Z 25004KT 9999 BKN043 M13/M15 Q1020 NOSIG=EFHK 230720Z 23005KT 9999 BKN042 M14/M16 Q1019 NOSIG=EFHK 230650Z 29003KT 9999 SCT042 M14/M16 Q1019 NOSIG=EFHK 230620Z 30005KT 9999 SCT040 M14/M16 Q1019 NOSIG=EFHK 230550Z 30007KT 9999 FEW045 M13/M15 Q1019 NOSIG=EFHK 230520Z 30009KT 9999 FEW045 M12/M14 Q1018 NOSIG=EFHK 230450Z 29005KT 9999 FEW043 M12/M13 Q1018 NOSIG=EFHK 230420Z 30005KT 9999 FEW043 M11/M12 Q1018 NOSIG=
A PAL Philippine Airlines Airbus A340-300, registration RP-C3435 performing flight PR-117 from Vancouver,BC (Canada) to Manila (Philippines), was accelerating for takeoff from Vancouver's runway 08R when the tower controller heard a loud boom. The aircraft continued takeoff, climbed out and continued the flight. The controller closed the runway for an inspection, which found tyre debris as well as other debris on the runway. The crew was advised via ATC. The runway was closed for about 15 minutes until the debris had been cleaned up. The aircraft landed in Manila on Sep 25th (local time) without further incident.The Canadian TSB reported after landing in Manila several holes were found in the fuselage skin in the landing gear area. There was substantial damage to the belly as well as the center landing gear fairing door. The occurrence was rated an accident, however, no investigation was opened.The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground in Manila for 17 days and performed a positioning flight from Manila to Angeles (Philippines) on Oct 11th 2018.https://flightaware.com/live/flight/PAL117/history/20180924/0840Z/CYVR/RPLL
An Alitalia Cityliner Embraer ERJ-175, registration EI-RDM performing flight AZ-568 from Rome Fiumicino (Italy) to Geneva (Switzerland), was accelerating for takeoff from Fiumicino's runway 25 when just before becoming airborne the aircraft experienced excessive vibrations. The crew continued takeoff, the aircraft became airborne, the vibrations ceased and the aircraft climbed out. The crew stopped the climb at FL200 after being told tyre debris had been found on the departure runway and decided to return to Fiumicino. The aircraft landed on runway 16R about 35 minutes after departure and stopped on the runway.A passenger reported there had been extreme vibrations just before the aircraft became airborne. After the crew decided to return to Rome the cabin was prepared for a rough landing, passengers were instructed to assume the brace position for landing. The landing was "heavy" but successful, there was no need to evacuate the aircraft. The passengers disembarked normally via stairs onto the runway, were medically checked and offered water, none of the passengers indicated injuries. The passengers were subsequently bussed to the terminal, where police registered every one, which lasted about two hours, before the passengers were released to their hotels or their homes.On Oct 11th 2018 Italy's ANSV announced they have opened an investigation into the occurrence now rated a serious incident after all necessary information to correctly rate the occurrence has been obtained.The shredded tyres:
A Indigo Airbus A320-200, registration VT-IHN performing flight 6E-743 from Hyderabad to Goa (India) with 80 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Hyderabad's runway 09R when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed after the crew spotted a vehicle on the runway. The aircraft slowed safely and came to a stop about 1900 meters down the runway (about mid point of the runway). The aircraft returned to the apron.The aircraft remained on the ground for about 80 minutes, then departed again and reached Goa with a delay of 75 minutes.
A Jetblue Airbus A321-200, registration N923JB performing flight B6-178 from Las Vegas,NV to Boston,MA (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from runway 01R when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 80 knots over ground) advising they needed emergency services to verify there was no right hand engine (V2533) fire. Tower advised there was smoke coming from the right hand engine. Emergency services responded.The airline reported the aircraft experienced smoke coming off its right engine before takeoff, the smoke was quickly suppressed and the aircraft taxied back to the gate where passengers disembarked normally.
A Delta Airlines Boeing 767-300, registration N180DN performing flight DL-420 from New York JFK,NY (USA) to Accra (Ghana) with 250 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from New York's runway 13R when the crew rejected takeoff due to disagreeing airspeeds. The crew advised they didn't need assistance at this time and they were ready to return to the gate. The aircraft vacated the runway via taxiway L about 2700 meters/8900 feet down the runway and taxied via taxiway A around the terminal complex and was near the intersection of taxiways A and W when a ground observer notified ground about flames from the back of the aircraft, ground subsequently advised the Delta crew there were flames from the right main gear, at least a strong glow, emergency services had already been dispatched. The aircraft stopped near the intersection taxiways A and W. Emergency services foamed the right main gear and put the fire out. The passengers disembarked via mobile stairs after the fire was put out.

A Ryanair Boeing 737-800, registration EI-DPJ performing flight FR-4703 from Porto (Portugal) to Milan Bergamo (Italy), departed Porto's runway 17 when the crew observed an "Unidentified Nonflying Object (UNO)" on the runway. The crew continued the takeoff and the flight to Bergamo for a safe landing at the destination.The airline reported: "The crew of this flight from Porto to Milan Bergamo (25 Sep) reported an object (car tyre) on the runway after take-off. The aircraft landed normally, was inspected by engineers at Milan Bergamo and cleared to return to service."Portugese media claimed the aircraft hit a wheel on the runway on departure from Porto.
A Vim Airlines Boeing 737-500, registration VP-BVS performing charter flight NN-9945 from Riga (Latvia) to Ufa (Russia) with about 40 passengers and 7 crew, was about to accelerate for takeoff from runway 18 at about 12:00L (10:00Z) when the aircraft began to yaw right turning about 90 degrees off the runway center line, skidded sideways, departed the right hand runway edge, collided with runway signs and a RVR sensor and became disabled on the runway. There were no injuries, the right hand engine (CFM56), right hand wing leading edge and the left hand engine inlet received damage.The airport reported the aircraft skidded sideways on the runway. There were no injuries, the runway was closed for about 2 hours.The aircraft was about to carry the Icehockey Club HC Lada Tolyatti to the next match.Ground observer Aleksandrs Cubikins reported that there appeared to be a problem with the right hand engine, the aircraft veered right, went off the runway onto soft ground and subsequently managed to re-enter the runway. On Sep 27th 2018 Latvia's TAIIB released their final report concluding the probable causes of the serious incident were:Proximate CauseThe flight crew operation was not coordinated in accordance with the take-off procedure.Root Cause- The FO (copilot) didnt act upon the aircraft Flight Manual requirements in the takeoff procedure.- Insufficient training skills of the flight crew in the Standard Operational Procedures.- The flight crew didnt report of any technical failures in the previous flight.Contributing causes- Short-term technical failure of the thrust control system.- The rejected takeoff (RTO) procedure wasnt initiated immediately after the technical abnormality.- Erroneous decision to continue the moving after the run off from the runway surface.Primary causeHuman Factor in an abnormal flight situation.The TAIIB summarized the sequence of events: "The charts of FDR data after decoding show following: shortly after the takeoff was initiated, the aircraft began a slight left turn followed by a sharp right turn."Subsequently the TAIIB reported more details based on the FDR:The FDR data shows that:LH engine N1 was about 87% while RH engine N1 was about 66% therefore the difference was about 21%. The left engine N1 spooled up faster than the right engine which caused aircraft to deviate slightly right of centerline. Small amounts of left rudder were commanded to correct the heading.The crew returned the rudder to neutral position shortly before time 640 seconds. Simultaneously, reverse thrust was commanded on only to the left engine which caused the airplane to continue turning left.Taking into account the results of borescope inspection, which confirmed the impurity of both engines with mud, grit and grass, it was not possible to carry out the engines operation tests in different regimes and the comparison with the technical characteristics of the engine manufacturer's manual.The TAAIB analysed: During the early stages of the takeoff roll and well below Vmcg (Minimum control speed on the ground) the engines thrust asymmetry occurred suddenly that caused the aircraft movement to the right. The PIC [aircraft pilot] attempted to counter the right yaw with full left rudder pedal input but unsuccessfully. The pilot hadn't start immediately RTO, as a result the aircraft left the runway and after colliding with the airport navigation equipment damaged its fuselage and both engines became unserviceable....According to the CVR conversation recordings, the Pilot Monitoring hasnt undertaken his duties and hasnt warned the Pilot Flying of the abnormal engine operation, as well as in the Pilot Monitoring interview it is not mentioned about of any abnormal indications in the takeoff rolling phase.It was therefore possible that neither of the pilots had the necessary awareness of the engine thrust indications because the crew attention was directed on the aircraft deviation.This diversion of attention could be a reason why the Pilot Flying hadnt any information about the thrust asymmetry during the start of the takeoff and therefore he wasn't aware of the reason for the difficulty in maintaining of the directional control of the aircraft.From the Pilot Flying interview and CVR recordings it has been established that, the Pilot Flying believed the difficulty was based on problems with the nose wheel steering....But the FDR data and CVR recordings show that the Pilot Flying hadn't decided to start the Rejected takeoff procedure when the airplane deviated heading more than 20 degrees and the aircraft was from the runway.Metars:EVRA 171220Z 24006KT 8000 OVC006 04/04 Q1011 R18/290195 NOSIG EVRA 171150Z 24005KT 210V280 8000 OVC005 04/04 Q1011 R18/290195 NOSIG EVRA 171120Z 24006KT 210V280 9000 -RA OVC004 04/04 Q1011 R18/290195 NOSIG EVRA 171050Z 24007KT 210V270 7000 -RA OVC004 04/04 Q1011 R18/290195 NOSIG EVRA 171020Z 23008KT 5000 -RA BR OVC004 04/04 Q1011 R18/290195 NOSIGEVRA 170950Z 23007KT 210V270 8000 -RA OVC004 03/03 Q1011 R18/290195 NOSIG EVRA 170920Z 23008KT 6000 -RA OVC004 03/03 Q1011 R18/290195 NOSIG EVRA 170850Z 23008KT 9000 -RA OVC005 03/03 Q1011 R18/290195 NOSIG EVRA 170820Z 23008KT 9000 -RA OVC003 03/03 Q1011 R18/290195 TEMPO 4000 BR EVRA 170750Z 23007KT 200V260 5000 -RA BR OVC003 03/03 Q1011 R18/290195 TEMPO 4000 EVRA 170720Z 23007KT 4100 -RA BR OVC003 03/03 Q1011 R18/290195 NOSIGGround observer video, after the actual occurrence (Video: Mihails Ardasnikovs):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwYCJeMDP4wThe aircraft off paved surface (Photo: aviofoto.lv/Aleksandrs Cubikins):Leading edge of the right hand wing:The left engine inlet (Photo: Riga International Airport):The trajectory of the aircraft (Graphics: TAIIB):
An Air Malta Airbus A319-100, registration 9H-AEJ performing flight KM-100 from Malta (Malta) to London Heathrow,EN (UK), was accelerating for takeoff from Malta's runway 31 when the aircraft encountered a flock of birds causing multiple impacts prompting the crew to reject takeoff at high speed (about 100 knots over ground). The aircraft slowed safely, stopped about 2100 meters down the runway for an inspection by emergency services, then taxied to the apron about 8 minutes after the rejected takeoff.The aircraft was examined and cleaned, then departed again after about 4 hours on the ground and reached London with a delay of about 3.5 hours.The local newspaper Malta Today used a file photo of an Air Malta aircraft having encountered multiple bird strikes, that looks like as if the aircraft was suffering from measles.

The aircraft slowed safely. The passengers disembarked via mobile stairs.A replacement A330-200 registration 7T-VJV reached Dubai with a delay of about 2 hours.On Sep 20th 2018 the airline reported only an acoustic panel of the engine was damaged.The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground in Algiers for about 48 hours, then departed for flight AH-4062 of Sep 18th.
A Delta Airlines Boeing 757-300, registration N581NW performing flight DL-1658 from San Francisco,CA to Detroit,MI (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from San Francisco's runway 01R when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 123 knots over ground) due to a right hand engine (PW2043) engine fire indication. The crew requested fire trucks to be rolled while the aircraft was still slowing down. Tower reported: "it does appear your left engine is on fire." Tower closed both runways 01R and 01L and instructed approaches to runways 28L and 28R to continue their approaches without issuing landing clearances, emergency services responded to runway 01R crossing runway 01L. After it was clear the Boeing 757-300 had passed both runways 28, the approaches to 28L and 28R were cleared to land. Emergency services put the fire out and reported seeing no fire on the left hand side. The aircraft taxied to the apron about 20 minutes after the rejected takeoff.The FAA reported: "DELTA AIRLINES FLIGHT 1658 BOEING 737 ABORTED TAKEOFF DUE TO RIGHT ENGINE FIRE, TAXIED TO GATE WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT."A replacement Boeing 757-300 registration N586NW reached Detroit with a delay of 2:10 hours.

A PAL Express Airbus A321-200, registration RP-C9923 performing flight PR-2814 from Davao to Manila (Philippines), was accelerating for takeoff from Davao's runway 05 when the right hand engine (V2533) ingested birds prompting the crew to reject takeoff at high speed. The aircraft slowed safely coming to a stop about 2170 meters/7150 feet down the runway and returned to the apron.The flight was cancelled.The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground in Davao for 61.5 hours, then positioned to Manila and is still on the ground in Manila about 107 hours (almost 4.5 days) after the rejected takeoff.Passenger video, first version withdrawn, second enhanced version released Sep 2nd 2018 (Video: Sir Gregory):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5o0E5l_mxYScreenshot of video above at 1:01 into the video (Photo: AVH/Sir Gregory):
An Aeroflot Airbus A320-200, registration VP-BNL performing flight SU-1395 from Perm to Moscow Sheremetyevo (Russia) with 148 passengers, was accelerating for takeoff from Perm's runway 21 when tower instructed the crew to reject takeoff. The crew complied and rejected takeoff at about 110 KIAS. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The aircraft was able to depart later and reached Moscow with a delay of about 4.5 hours.Rosaviatsia reported a military aircraft, a MIG-31, taxied onto the runway at the end of runway. Tower instructed the A320 to reject takeoff.
A SA Express Canadair CRJ-700, registration ZS-NBG performing flight XZ-1412/SA-1412 from East London to Johannesburg (South Africa), was climbing out of East London when about 5 minutes after takeoff a loud bang was heard and vibrations could be felt. The crew stopped the climb, shut down the affected engine (CF34) and returned to East London for a safe landing about 20 minutes after departure.Passengers reported the aircraft had departed with a delay of about 100 minutes after the crew attempted to start the engine several times. The captain announced that a circuit breaker kept popping, maintenance was going to look after the issue. The captain subsequently announced the issue was fixed, the engine was started and the aircraft departed, however, 5 minutes after takeoff a loud bang was heard, the aircraft was rattling. The crew turned the aircraft out over the sea, announced that they had lost an engine and landed back about 20 minutes after departure.On Aug 24th 2018 South Africa's CAA (SACAA) released their preliminary report reporting all stage 1 high pressure turbine blades of the left hand engine (CF34) had fractured at about mid span of the air foils. Blistered shroud segments showed extreme heat and impact damage. Several stage 2 high pressure turbine blades were fractured by impact damage. The preliminary report seems to contradict itself describing the damage to the low pressure turbine (in 3.8 reporting all rotor blades of the low pressure turbine had been destroyed, in 3.9 however reporting the last stage rotor blades had remained undamaged):3.8 On the low-pressure turbine (LPT) stator vanes and blades, the destruction and debris field in the LPT were noticeable, with complete destruction of all LPT rotor blades and stator vanes.3.9 The on-site investigation revealed that there was debris of the blades inside the exhaust frame and limited damage to the tips of the stator vanes of the LPT last stage. The rotor blades of the LPT final stage were found still intact, with no signs of damage.The SACAA reported the aircraft was climbing through about 800 feet AGL when the crew felt vibrations and heard a loud bang. The crew identified the #1 engine had failed and performed the memory items for severe engine damage. 
An Iberia Airbus A319-100, registration EC-LEI performing flight IB-2101 from Barcelona,SP to Madrid,SP (Spain), was accelerating for takeoff from Barcelona's runway 25L when the left hand engine (CFM56) ingested a number of birds prompting the crew to reject takeoff at around 80 knots. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.A passenger reported the captain announced a flock of ducks had been ingested by the #1 engine. The #1 engine was shut down and they taxied back to the apron on the #2 engine. The flight was cancelled, the passengers were rebooked onto other flights.
A Red Wings Tupolev TU-204, registration RA-64050 performing flight WZ-808 from Ufa to Sochi (Russia) with 215 passengers and 7 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Ufa's runway 14R when just before rotation the left hand engine (PS90A) surged. The crew continued takeoff, stopped the climb at about 1500 feet AGL, an under cowl fire became visible through gaps in the engine cowl emitting smoke, fire and sparks, and returned to Ufa for a safe landing on runway 14R about 5 minutes after departure. The passengers were evacuated via slides, while emergency services foamed the aircraft and engine. No injuries are being reported.The airline reported the aircraft made a comfortable return to Ufa following a technical malfunction. Firefighting was in place upon landing, the aircraft was evacuated. A replacement aircraft is being dispatched to take the passengers to Sochi.Rosaviatsia (Russia's Civil Aviation Authority) reported during the takeoff run the left hand engine (PS-90A) was surging, during climb out the tower informed the flight crew about fire from the left hand engine. The crew however did not receive any fire indication and the automatic fire suppression system did not work. The crew shut the engine down and engaged the fire suppression manually. Emergency services needed to put out the fire after landing, the passengers were evacuated through the right hand (emergency) doors via slides. There were no injuries. A commission has been set up to investigate the occurrence.Volga's Transport Prosecution Office also set up an investigation into the engine fire reporting the fire broke out at about 200 meters of height (660 feet) while the aircraft was climbing out of Ufa. The aircraft returned to Ufa and was evacuated. Emergency services put out the fire. The passengers were provided with medical and psychological assistance and were supplied with drinks and food while waiting for the replacement aircraft. A replacement aircraft departed with a delay of about 6:10 hours.A replacement TU-204 registration RA-64017 reached Sochi with a delay of 6:15 hours without 58 passengers, who refused to fly following their experience.Passenger video of the engine in flight (Video: SkyWay):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8xeFcmqZ-QPassenger video of the engine after landing (Video: Cotton Wand):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKaKCKClrzg
A Lufthansa Boeing 747-800, registration D-ABYP performing flight LH-511 from Buenos Aires Ezeiza,BA (Argentina) to Frankfurt/Main (Germany), was accelerating for takeoff from Ezeiza's runway 11 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 40 knots over ground) due to a problem with the #4 engine (GEnx, outboard right hand). The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The flight was cancelled.The airline reported a maintenance team has been dispatched to Buenos Aires to check the engine.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Buenos Aires about 96 hours after the rejected takeoff.
A Korean Air Boeing 777-300, registration HL7534 performing flight KE-2708 from Tokyo Haneda (Japan) to Seoul Gimpo (South Korea) with 302 passengers and 17 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Haneda's runway 34R when unusual vibrations were felt throughout the aircraft and smoke was seen from the left hand engine (PW4098). The crew rejected takeoff at low speed and stopped the aircraft about 1300 meters/4200 feet down the runway. Large flames were seen from the left hand engine, the aircraft was evacuated. 9 occupants received minor injuries in the evacuation and were taken to hospitals.The runway was closed for about 6 hours until the aircraft was moved off the runway and evidence was collected.Japan's Ministry of Transport reported the tower controllers observed flames and smoke from the left hand engine and instructed the crew to stop. An investigation into the occurrence has been opened. On May 28th 2016 the JTSB reported debris from the engines were found about 600 meters after the begin of takeoff run, tyre marks were seen in the following 700 meters.On Jun 20th 2016 the JTSB reported that examination of the engine revealed that a turbine disk fractured and departed the engine through the engine casing. The aircraft rejected takeoff and was evacuated, 9 occupants received minor injuries. The occurrence has been rated a "critical incident".On Nov 8th 2017 the JTSB released a press release reporting that the investigation into the "serious incident" is ongoing. So far it has been established that the disk of the first stage of the high pressure turbine partially fractured causing damage to the turbine case and engine cowl. The resulting vibrations also caused cracks to other engine components, in particular the engine fuel and oil heat exchanger, which resulted in a fuel leak with fuel pouring down the engine cover. The fuel ignited causing the fire outside of the engine. On Aug 20th 2018 the JTSB released their final report concluding the probable cause of the accident was:It is highly probable that the causes of this accident were the fracture of the high pressure turbine (HPT) disk of the No.1 (left-side) engine during the takeoff ground roll, the penetration of the fragment through the engine case and the occurrence of subsequent fires. Regarding the cause for the 1st stage HPT disk to be fractured, it is probable that a step was machined exceeding the allowable limit when machining U-shaped groove on the aft side of the 1st stage HPT disk to manufacture the engine and from this step the low-cycle fatigue crack was initiated and propagated during running of engine.Regarding why the step could not be found, it is somewhat likely that defects failed to be detected at the time of the inspection by the manufacturer during the production process. And as for the cracks that were not found, it is somewhat likely that those cracks failed to be detected at non-destructive inspection on the disk by the Company at the time of maintenance of the engine in use.Regarding the fire breakout from the No.1 engine, it is probable that due to the impact forces generated by the release of the fragment from the ruptured rim part of the 1st stage HPT disk through the engine case and the engine rundown loads generated when the engine stopped suddenly, the cracks were developed in the outer case of the Fuel Oil Heat Exchanger and the fuel and engine oil leaking through these cracks contacted the hot area of engine cases of the No.1 engine to be ignited.The JTSB analysed:when this accident occurred (at around 12:38), wind blew at about 20 kt from the almost right abeam Runway 34R. Because the fire and smoke accompanying the fire breakout from the No.1 engine was blown by this beam wind to the lee side which was the left side of the Aircraft, it is probable that the fire did not cause that much effect on the Aircraft and the cabin. Furthermore, using the right side slide of the Aircraft which was at the up wind side for the emergency evacuation, it is probable that there were not much effects by the fire and smoke.However, regarding why the R5 slide at its deploying was slipped to under the Aircraft, it is somewhat likely that as described later in 3.7.5, the strong abeam wind from the right combined with the thrust still being produced by the #2 engine at the ground idle setting could have the effects.With respect to causes of the fracture the JTSB analysed:It is probable that the crack generated in U-shaped groove was propagating by the action of repetitive stress per a flight. The Company executed the FPI on the 1st stage HPT disk when disassembling the HPT module, but the crack was not found. As the result of analyzing the fractured surface, it is somewhat likely that the cracks in U-shaped groove of the 1st stage HPT disk may exist prior to the last inspection conducted at the engine repair shop on November 12, 2014. Based on these, it is probable that because the cracks were not be discovered at FPI conducted the previous inspection and due to the flight following the inspection, the cracks were propagating more to be fractured.The JTSB analysed with respect to the engine damage, that first debris was found 680 meters from the threshold of the runway. The debris was found consistent with the ejection of the fractured 1st stage HPT disk rim. The damage caused fuel and oil leaks, the fuel and oil ignited when it contacted high temperature engine case parts. In additon, the fuel oil heat exchanger showed internal cracks although there was no damage from the outside. The JTSB wrote: "Therefore it is probable that those cracks were developed, when the 1st stage HPT disk rim had been fractured and released, and struck into the turbine case, a strong shock force was generated. In addition, it is also probable that engine run down loads, which were generated when the engine No.1 stopped suddenly following the disk rupture, was the contributing factor."The JTSB analysed that the crew discharged the first fire bottle which resulted in the fire indication to extinguish for about 5-10 seconds, then the fire warning activated again, the second fire bottle was discharged, the fire warning again extinguished for 5-10 seconds then reactivated. The captain thus decided to evacuate the aircraft. The JTSB analysed that following the decision to evacuate the checklist was not immediately handy, while the first officer looked for the checklist and because the captain felt the evacuation was needed in a hurry, the captain performed the checklist items to shut the engines down from memory. The FDR showed, that the right hand engine was shut down by moving the fuel cut off lever only 54 seconds after the evacuation order was given at 12:43:45. The JTSB wrote: "And the first door being opened was L1 door and the time was 12:43:17. Based on these, instruction of emergency evacuation prior to halting of the No.2 engine positioned in the evacuating direction was given, it is highly probable that the No.2 engine was stopped about 28 seconds later after the first door was opened. The wind velocity of the engine wake air flow is 55 km/h even at the time of idle thrust and when conducting the emergency evacuation prior to the engine stopped, there are potential threat that the passengers could be blown away by the engine wake air flow and others. It is necessary for the Company to revise the education and training in order to enforce the thorough compliance to emergency evacuation procedure." The JTSB further analysed: "when deploying R5 slide, the No.2 engine was at idle thrust. According to the materials of the manufacturer of the Aircraft, the predicted jet engine exhaust velocity contours at idle thrust is 7 m wide at the rear end of the Aircraft, extends to the approximately 40 m ahead while being tapered at the level of approximate 6 m high and the wind velocity is about 30 kt. Calculating the resultant wind from the wind of the jet engine exhaust blow at setting of the heading at 335º with the wind direction 060ºand velocity about 20 kt at the time of the accident, was resulting in the wind direction 007ºand the velocity about 37.5 kt. The velocity is 1.5 times of the allowable limit which is 25 kt for the velocity to make a slide have normal deployment."The aftermath after coming to a stop (Video: Manuel A.

A Nolinor Boeing 737-200, registration C-GTUK performing flight N5-950 from Churchill,MB to Meadowbank,NU (Canada) with 76 passengers and 5 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Churchill, when the crew observed numerous Canada geese fly over the runway and rejected takeoff at about 120 KIAS. The aircraft collided with a goose and came to a stop with about 1200 feet of runway remaining. The crew set the park brake to assess the situation before returning to the apron. Upon releasing the brakes the crew noticed the brakes had seized. Emergency services were called out to inspect the landing gear and found both tyres on the left main gear had deflated due to the melting of the fusible plugs disabling the aircraft on the runway. The Canadian TSB reported the operator's maintenance replaced all 4 main tyres and brakes and performed a high energy braking inspection.NAV Canada reported runway 15/33 was closed for 10 hours.
An American Airline Airbus A321-200, registration N544UW performing flight AA-1668 from Charlotte,NC to Chicago O'Hare,IL (USA), was in the initial climb out of Charlotte's runway 36C when the crew declared emergency reporting the right hand engine (V2533) had stalled on takeoff, they had no fire indication, ground observers observed repeated compressor stalls (bangs and streaks of flame). The aircraft climbed to 3000 feet, tower offered an immediate return to runway 18C, the crew preferred to fly the downwind for 36C however. The aircraft climbed to 4000 feet, positioned for a long (20nm) approach to runway 36C and landed safely about 30 minutes after departure.A replacement A321-200 registration N981UY reached Chicago with a delay of 3 hours.https://flightaware.com/live/flight/AAL1668/history/20180815/1136Z/KCLT/KORDThe aircraft seen and heard from the ground (Video: Les Photos de JCB TV & Aviation Videos):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee_Azx82V6g
A Horizon Air de Havilland Dash 8-400, registration N449QX performing an unauthorized flight from Seattle,WA (USA) to an undefined destination, departed Seattle's runway 16C without takeoff clearance with tower trying to query callsign and authorization at 19:35L (Aug 11th 02:35Z). The aircraft was subsequently seen in what appeared to be aerobatics or uncontrolled flight, two F-15 fighter aircraft were dispatched on scene at supersonic speed (and creating sonic booms). The Dash 8 crashed into a forest at Ketron Island,WA (USA), about 22nnm southwest of Seattle Tacoma Airport, about one hour after departing Seattle.Pierce County,WA Sheriff's Office reported a 29 year old employee of Horizon Air stole the aircraft and performed an unauthorized takeoff. Two F-15 fighter aircraft were dispatched creating sonic booms. The Dash 8 crashed at Ketron Island,WA about one hour after the unauthorized takeoff. The 29 year old was the only person on board and died in the crash. FBI, NTSB and FAA are investigating, the FBI have now taken the lead into the criminal investigation.Alaska Airlines, parent company of Horizon Air, initially reported the aircraft involved was N449QX but later removed the tail number from all their reports. The chairman confirmed one of their aircraft was involved in the occurrence, the thoughts are with the family of the deceased and their entire Horizon/Alaska Airlines family.The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) reported the FAA requested assistance by the Department of Defence (DoD) due to a stolen aircraft a Seatac Airport, two F-15s were dispatched and were working to redirect the Dash out over the Pacific Ocean when it crashed. Neither of the fighter aircraft fired on the Dash 8. The further handling was passed to local rescue and law enforcement.Alaska Airlines Fleet Update stated: "I can confirm the crashed plane was certainly #N449QX, as all other repainted Q400s are either currently parked at another airport or are in flight. It was the second of two planes delivered to Horizon Air in 2012."No Mode-S or ADS-B were transmitted from the aircraft (suggesting its transponder was off) at the time of the departure or the subsequent hour until impact.On Aug 13th 2018 the FAA reported, N449QX "CRASHED ON ISLAND NEAR PUGET SOUND", the sole pilot on board died.The FBI reported they have recovered the flight data recorder and components of the cockpit voice recorder.On Aug 14th 2018 the NTSB stated: "The investigation of this event is being conducted under the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The NTSB provided requested technical assistance to the FBI, and any material generated by the NTSB is under the control of the FBI. The NTSB does not plan to issue a report or open a public docket." The NTSB reported: "On August 10, 2018, about 2043 Pacific daylight time, a De Havilland DHC-8-402, N449QX, was destroyed when it impacted trees on Ketron Island, near Steilacoom, WA. The non-certificated pilot was fatally injured. The airplane was registered to Horizon Air Industries Inc. and operated by the individual as an unauthorized flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed in the area at the time of the accident, and no flight plan was filed. The airplane departed from the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Seattle, Washington, about 1932 for an unknown destination. Horizon Air personnel reported that the individual was employed as a ground service agent and had access to the airplanes on the ramp."Various Ground Observer videos (Video: PHP):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeYVtVg6aGsMap (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):

A British Airways Boeing 777-200, registration G-VIIO performing flight BA-2276 from Las Vegas,NV (USA) to London Gatwick,EN (UK) with 157 passengers and 13 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Las Vegas' runway 07L when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed and stopped the aircraft about 800 meters/2600 feet down the runway, an arrival to the parallel runway 07R was instructed to go around. After coming to a stop the crew radioed "Mayday, Mayday, need fire services", tower replied fire services were already on their way, the crew advised they were evacuating, they had a fire, they were evacuating. One person received serious and 5 people minor injuries in the evacuation, two of them were taken to hospitals. Smoke and flames were seen from the left hand engine (GE90), emergency services responded and put the fire out about 4 minutes after the aircraft rejected takeoff. The aircraft received substantial fire/heat damage to left hand inboard wing and fuselage.Las Vegas Airport reported flames were spotted at 16:14L (23:14Z), the fire was put out by 16:18L. Two occupants were taken to hospitals for minor injuries, a total of seven needed medical attention.Emergency services reported a total of 13 occupants required medical treatment.The FAA reported on Sep 9th 2015 that the left hand engine caught fire during the departure roll, aircraft stopped on the runway and was evacuated via slides, 5 persons received unknown injuries. The aircraft was substantially damaged, the occurrence was rated an accident.Passengers reported there was a loud bang from the left hand side, the brakes came on, then there was enormeous heat, that appeared to melt down a couple of passenger windows, smoke entered the aircraft. They evacuated down the slides and were taken to the terminal. Later the captain joined the passengers at the terminal and told them, that they had suffered a catastrophic failure of the left hand engine.A planespotter from Salzburg (Austria) visiting Las Vegas reported, that he was watching aircraft at Las Vegas Aerodrome at East Sunset Road, below the approach path to runways 07. He took notice of the Boeing 777-200 when it taxied towards the holding point runway 07L because there were not many heavies around. The Boeing appeared to be taxiing rather slowly, lined up normally, engines accelerated normally and the aircraft was about 200-300 meters/600-1000 feet into the departure roll when a large streak of fire and dense smoke was emitted by the left hand engine, without any noise. The aircraft slowed and came to a stop, dense black smoke rising from the aircraft.The airline reported: "The aircraft, a 777-200 experienced a technical issue as it was preparing for take-off from McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas. Our crew evacuated the aircraft safely and the fire was quickly extinguished by the emergency services at the airport. 157 customers were on board the flight, along with three pilots and 10 cabin crew. A small number of customers and our crew have been taken to hospital." The passengers were taken to hotels, hotlines have been opened for friends and relatives of those on board.The NTSB have dispatched three investigators on site.The runway was closed for 4 hours, the FAA issued ground stops for a number of flights inbound to Las Vegas. On Sep 10th 2015 the NTSB reported first preliminary findings. The NTSB reported that there were multiple breaches of the engine case in the area of the high pressure compressor, several pieces of the high pressure compressor spool were found on the runway. The engine, engine pylon, fuselage structure and the inboard left wing were substantially damaged by fire. A number of occupants received minor injuries, mainly abrasions, in the evacuation. Cockpit Voice, Flight Data and Quick Access recorders have been taken to the NTSB Laboratory and are being downloaded. On Sep 15th 2015 media reports started to surface claiming that the FAA had made links between an Airworthiness Directive (AD) FAA-2010-1024 issued by the FAA in 2011 concerning a weld joint between 9th and 10th stage of the HPCR spool 8-10, where cracks had been discovered during examination of an engine, the FAA rated that condition as potentially unsafe and required additional inspections of GE90-76B, GE90-77B, GE90-85B, GE90-90B and GE90-94B engines. General Electric states however, that the BA B772 was equipped with different parts, for which this AD FAA-2010-1024 is not applicable.On Oct 2nd 2015 the NTSB released their preliminary report reporting that there was one serious and 5 minor injuries as result of the evacuation following an uncontained #1 engine failure resulting in a fire damaging the #1 engine, inboard left wing and portions of left and right fuselage.On Oct 6th 2015 the NTSB reported that first examination of the engine revealed that the stage 8-10 spool in the high pressure compressor (HPC) had failed liberating fragments that breached the engine case and cowling. Additional pieces of the HPC were found inside the engine and sent for metallurgic examination. The fracture began in the stage 8 disk web.On Apr 12th 2017 the NTSB opened their public docket. The documents available suggest that the crew reacted within one second after the left hand engine's N2 dropped from stable 113% to 98% with increasing fuel flow. The #1 engine fuel cut off lever was moved to off within one second, the right hand engine's thrust lever was brought to idle at the same time. 6 seconds after the N2 dropped the engine fire warning became active followed by a engine #1 overheat warning. The aircraft came to stop, the crew radioed their were stopping and initiated the engine fire checklist. The crew announced to the passengers to remain seated. 26 seconds after the captain called "STOP" the crew radioed Mayday and requested fire services. Smoke was observed on board of the aircraft, however, it was believed for some time the fire had gone out. 150 seconds after N2 dropped the captain instructed the cabin to evacuate right hand side, 4 seconds later the crew informed ATC about the evacuation. 192 seconds after N2 dropped a forward cargo smoke warning became active. The crew discussed engine shut down checklists and evacuation checklists and read the evacuation checklist (until end of CVR recording).The powerplant group reported in their chairman's report:The pieces of the high pressure compressor recovered on site were first sent to the NTSB material laboratory for initial metallurgical examination. The received pieces accounted for less than 50% of the stage 8 outer rim. One of the recovered pieces with the dovetail slot and forward seal teeth still attached exhibited a hemi-elliptical shaped flat-fracture region that initiated in fatigue on the aft face of the web and transitioned circumferentially in both directions. A field emission scanning electron microscope was used to examine the surface in greater detail and the fracture region revealed an intergranular appearance near the initiation site and striations in the transgranular region of the fracture where striation density measurements could be taken to estimate the number of flight cycles from initiation/detection to failure. The NTSB materials laboratory estimated the number of flight cycles from detection to separation to be approximately 5,400 cycles. The last inspection of the event high pressure compressor spool was conducted by GE Wales 3,943 cycles prior to the failure.After the initial examination of the high pressure compressor stage 8 pieces by the NTSB materials laboratory, they were sent to the GE Aviation Material Laboratory for further evaluation along with the stage 8 disk that was removed during the engine disassembly. Over several weeks, persons from the NTSB and FAA participated and oversaw much of the additional examination and testing. With all the recovered parts of the high pressure compressor stage 8 disk put together, it appeared that the entire disk rim and web was accounted for. GEs analysis of the stage 8 disk concluded: 1) the crack initiation propagated with intergranular features with local variations consistent with hold-time, high-alternating stress, low cycle fatigue (hold-time low cycle/sustained-peak, low cycle) consistent with the NTSB finding, 2) no microstructural anomalies or detrimental species in the grain boundaries were found near the fracture origin, 3) the material composition, hardness, and grain structure were as specified, 4) multiple secondary cracks were found, but only within 0.016 inches radially of the fatigue region, 5) just like the primary fracture, no microstructural anomalies were found at the secondary crack locations, and 6) the shot peening appearance on the forward web face had more pronounced peening dimples than the web aft face. GE also performed their own striation density calculation and they estimated the number of flight cycles from detection to separation to be between approximately 5,000  5,700 cycles, consistent with the NTSB finding.In order to better understand how the crack could have initiated in the web of the stage 8 disk, GE performed a series of additional hardware testing (for example residual stress and strain distortion), computational analysis (reevaluated the LCF lifing based on the actual event hardware, including all the material review board accepted allowable deviations and under the worst material property conditions) and operation mission profile review (verify stresses during taxing time, takeoff thrust rating, shutdown, core speeds and temperatures, ambient takeoff temperature, etc.). All the predictive calculations that GE performed could not close on the event crack location at the number of cycles it was thought to have initiated the crack; however, the striation density curves that were developed for the event spool match well with the analytical predictive crack propagation rate.Based on this event, GE developed and incorporated into the engine maintenance manual a set of unique non-destructive inspections for the HPC stage 8-10 spool focusing on the event crack location. These inspections can be performed at the piece part, rotor and module levels, as well as on-wing. Along with the addition of the engine manual non-destructive inspections, GE released three separate service bulletins (SB 72-1145, SB 72-1146, and SB 72-1151) to inspect all the GE90 HPC stage 8-10 spools with part number 1694M80G04 (failure event spool part number) and a selected number of spools part numbers 1844M90G01 & G02. The Federal Aviation Administration mandated those inspections by issuing airworthiness directives AD 2015-27-01 and AD 2016-13-05.On Jun 20th 2018 the NTSB released their final report concluding the probable cause of the accident was:The failure of the left engine high-pressure compressor (HPC) stage 8-10 spool, which caused the main fuel supply line to become detached from the engine main fuel pump and release fuel, resulting in a fire on the left side of the airplane. The HPC stage 8-10 spool failed due to a sustained-peak low-cycle fatigue crack that initiated in the web of the stage 8 disk; the cause of the crack initiation could not be identified by physical inspection and stress and lifing analysis. Contributing to this accident was the lack of inspection procedures for the stage 8 disk web.The NTSB analysed that a "bang" sound was heard in the cockpit followed by an aural announciation "engine fail" via the EICAS. The captain moved the thrust levers to idle at about 77 knots, two seconds after the bang, and rejected takeoff bringing the aircraft to a stop 15 seconds after the bang. The NTSB wrote: "Thus, the captain made a timely decision to reject the takeoff and performed the maneuver in accordance with company training and procedures."The NTSB analysed that the engine manufacturer predicted the aft web face would endure about 30,000 cycles before crack initiation than the actual engine, which had accumulated 11,459 cycles, the cracks causing the accident had developed over about 5400 cycles starting at about cycle 6000. The NTSB wrote: "GE was unable to determine why a crack initiated via sustained-peak low-cycle fatigue in the disk web. GE has not previously experienced environmental cracking under the operational conditions to which the stage 8 disk web was subjected and GE's postaccident inspections of additional HPC stage 8-10 spools did not find any cracks in any other disk webs. Further inspection of the accident stage 8 disk did not find additional cracks in the web (other than secondary cracks in the immediate area of the crack that led to the disk failure). The disk web was not an area that required routine inspections, so the crack on the accident disk went undetected."With respect to the evacuation the NTSB analysed:While the airplane was decelerating to a stop, the fire warning bell sounded. When the airplane came to stop, the captain called for the engine fire checklist. The third item on the checklist was to move the fuel control switch on the affected side (in this case, the left side) to the cutoff position, which shuts down the respective engine. The spar valve terminates fuel flow to an engine after it is shut down. Flight data recorder (FDR) data showed that about 28 seconds elapsed between the start of the engine failure and the time of the spar valve closure, and Boeing estimated that about 97 gallons of fuel had spilled onto the runway during this time. FDR data also showed that 22 seconds elapsed between the time that the captain initially called for the engine fire checklist and the time of the spar valve closure. (Thirteen seconds had elapsed between the time that the captain repeated his call for the engine fire checklist and the time of the spar valve closure.) If the left engine had been shut down sooner, there would have been less fuel on the runway to feed the fire. The flight crew informed the passengers and flight attendants to remain seated and await further instruction, which was consistent with the flight crew's training and procedures if an evacuation was not going to immediately occur. The cabin crew reinforced the flight crew's expectation by instructing passengers to remain seated. As part of the flight crew's evaluation of the situation, the relief pilot left the cockpit and entered the forward cabin so that he could look outside a window. Before the relief pilot returned, the CVR recorded the captain's statements indicating that the airplane should be evacuated. The relief pilot returned to the cockpit shortly afterward and informed the captain of the need to evacuate on the right side of the airplane because of the fire. The captain then commanded the evacuation, and a flight crewmember activated the evacuation alarm. When the relief pilot went into the cabin to assess the situation outside of the airplane, a flight attendant told him that she had been trying to call the flight crew. The CVR recorded a sound similar to an interphone call from the cabin to the flight deck, but the flight crewmembers most likely did not answer the call because they were focused on securing the left engine and deciding whether to evacuate. After the captain's evacuation command, the flight attendants assessed their areas and opened the doors that they deemed usable. Five of the eight door exits were initially blocked by flight attendants, which was appropriate given the hazards associated with the smoke, fire, and unusual attitude of two slides. A sixth door, which was initially opened, was blocked once a flight attendant saw flames on the runway, which was also appropriate. Although only two of the eight door exits were used throughout the evacuation, the passengers and crewmembers were able to evacuate before smoke and fire encroached the fuselage. The captain commanded the evacuation (step three in the evacuation checklist) before calling for the evacuation checklist and performing the first two steps in the checklist. Step two of the evacuation checklist instructs the captain to shut down both engines. The left engine was shut down as part of the engine fire checklist, but the right engine continued operating for about 43 seconds after the captain's evacuation command. The unusual attitude of two slides (the 3R and 4R slides) resulted from the jet blast coming from the right engine while it was operating.The captain did not use the QRH to read and do his evacuation checklist items. The right engine was shut down after the relief pilot noticed EICAS indications showing that the engine was still running. Also, the captain's call for the evacuation checklist occurred after the relief pilot stated that the checklist needed to be performed. (The first officer had stated, just before the relief pilot, "we haven't done the engine checklist," but he most likely meant the evacuation checklist.) Because the captain did not follow standard procedures, his call for the evacuation checklist and the shutdown of the right engine were delayed. With respect to passengers carrying their carry ons during evacuation the NTSB analysed:During a group debriefing by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch, the flight attendants stated that some passengers evacuated with carry-on baggage; however, the flight attendants thought that carry-on baggage retrieval did not slow the evacuation. They thought that most passengers who retrieved baggage did so after the airplane came to a stop and before the evacuation was commanded and that the flight attendants' assertive commands limited further retrieval. The flight attendants at the two most-used exits (doors 1R and 4L) recalled seeing very little baggage at their exits, and neither cited carry-on baggage as a problem. However, the NTSB notes that the accident airplane was only 55% full. Although not a factor in this evacuation, the NTSB remains concerned about the safety issues resulting from passengers evacuating with carry-on baggage, which could potentially slow the egress of passengers and block an exit during an emergency. The NTSB previously addressed carry-on baggage in a June 2000 safety study on evacuations of commercial airplanes and issued Safety Recommendation A-18-9 in February 2018 as part of its final report on the American Airlines flight 383 investigation.ABC News coverage including onboard passenger video, seconds 32-50 (Video: ABC News)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMZp8iP6isEVideo of a passenger on another flight (Video: Ravi S):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stsMzxKrr6QVideo of a passenger in the terminal (Video: Balaji Rajgiri)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Ecr5h_Y-MThe NTSB monitoring removal of the engine on Sep 16th 2015 (Photo: NTSB):The aircraft just before evacuation began (Photo: Andy Woodfield):The aircraft after the fire had been extinguished (Photo: AFP/L.E.

A Globus Airlines Boeing 737-800 on behalf of S7 Sibir Airlines, registration VP-BDF performing flight GH-173/S7-173 from Moscow Domodedovo to Novosibirsk (Russia) with 129 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Domodedovo's runway 32R when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed due to smoke in the cabin. The aircraft slowed safely and came to a stop about 2000 meters down the runway, the crew initiated an emergency evacuation via slides. 18 passengers requested medical assistance, however, there were no injuries, the passengers were taken to the terminal. The aircraft was towed to the apron.A replacement S7 Sibir Airlines Airbus A320-200 registration VQ-BDF (Editorial note: only second letter of registration different!) reached Novosibirsk with a delay of 3:40 hours.Passengers reported the crew hinted de-icing fluid might have gotten into the engines (CFM56) and probably caused the smoke.Rosaviatsia opened an investigation into the occurrence.On Jun 13th 2018 Rosaviatsia reported the serious incident was the result of maintenance and technical personnel's failure to comply with the requirements of the procedures to conduct an engine compressor wash.Rosaviatsia reported that during taxiing out for departure an unpleasant odour developed on board which was identified as anti-icing fluid that entered the air conditioning system during treatment of the aircraft. While accelerating for takeoff heavy smoke apppeared in cabin and cockpit prompting the crew to reject takeoff at 100 KIAS. The crew brought the aircraft to a stop and initiated an emergency evacuation through all emergency exits including all overwing exits and all forward and aft doors. The investigation determined that during the previous night an engine compressor wash had been carried out, however, the procedure had not been carried out in full, the engine inlet had been purged at low engine power in violation of the manual's requirements. The engine should have been run between 60 and 80% N1 for the purge with absence of any odour or evaporation products.Rosaviatsia's investigation commission thus concluded the most probable cause of the serious incident was the evaporation of cleaning fluid 20K-27, which remained in the bleed air system after the engine compressor wash, caused the smoke and the subsequent evacuation of the aircraft due to the failure to fully implement AMM 72-00-00 Maintenance Manual. 
A Nordica Canadair CRJ-900 on behalf of LOT Polish Airlines, registration ES-ACB performing flight LO-8173 from Tallinn (Estonia) to Amsterdam (Netherlands) with 42 passengers and 4 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Tallinn when the crew rejected takeoff due to a smoke detector warning. The crew slowed the aircraft safely, stopped on the runway and performed a rapid disembarkation onto the runway. The passengers were taken to the terminal.A replacement CRJ-900 registration ES-ACL reached Amsterdam with a delay of 3 hours.The airline reported the aircraft rejected takeoff just prior to rotating the aircraft when the captain reacted to an aft lavatory smoke detector signal. All passengers were evacuated onto the runway and bussed to the terminal. The cause of the smoke detector activation is under investigation.
A Pegas Fly (also known as Ikar) Boeing 767-300, registration VP-BOZ performing flight IK-435 from Zhukovsky (Russia) to Jinan (China), was accelerating for takeoff from Zhukovsky's Airport's (also known as Moscow Ramenskoye Airport) runway 12 when the crew observed a number of birds ahead shortly followed by a brief vibration of the right hand engine (PW4062), all other parameters remained normal and the vibrations ceased again prompting the crew to continue the flight. The aircraft landed safely in Jinan without further incident.Rosaviatsia reported a post flight inspection of the right hand engine revealed remains of a bird in the core of the engine and damage to a number of fan blades as well as sound absorbing panels.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Jinan about 46 hours after landing.
A Lufthansa Airbus A321-200, registration D-AIDK performing flight LH-612 from Frankfurt/Main (Germany) to Baku (Azerbaidjan), was rotating for takeoff from Frankfurt's runway 18 when the right hand engine (V2533) emitted a loud bang and streaks of flame. The crew climbed the aircraft to 3000 feet and declared emergency. ATC immediately assigned runway 25C for landing and began to keep the runway sterile sending other arriving aircraft to 25L or 25R and kept communication with LH-612 to an absolute minimum telling them "it was all yours" (meaning speed and altitude) and to approve the turns onto downwind and base. The aircraft landed on runway 25C about 14 minutes after departure.A replacement A321-200 registration D-AIDN reached Baku with a delay of 5:15 hours.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground about 9 hours after landing back.The aircraft seen departing (Photos: @crowded.sky):

A TAP Air Portugal Airbus A319-100, registration CS-TTK performing flight TP-552 from Lisbon (Portugal) to Munich (Germany), was accelerating for takeoff from Lisbon's runway 03 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 30 knots over ground) and returned the aircraft to the apron.A passenger reported the crew rejected the takeoff about 15 seconds after the engines spooled up. The aircraft taxied to a remote location on the apron. The captain explained they had received a warning indication and therefore rejected takeoff. TAP maintenance was on their way to the aircraft to take care of the problem, in about 20 minutes more information would become available. About 45 minutes later the captain announced that the problem, a defective pump, was taking quite some time. They would therefore arrive in Munich past night curfew, the flight therefore needed to be cancelled. The passengers were rebooked onto other flights, some onto flights on May 11th only.The occurrence aircraft returned to service about 13 hours later.

A Saratov Airlines Yakovlev YaK-42D, flight 6W-9532 from Saratov to Surgut (Russia) with 107 passengers and 7 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Saratov when the crew rejected takeoff due to an engine indication. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.A replacement Yak-42D registration RA-42326 reached Surgut with a delay of about 13 hours.The airline reported the crew received an indication for one of the three engines and rejected takeoff. Examination of the aircraft revealed no damage to the engine or aircraft, the condition of the aircraft is being assessed. The passengers were taken to hotels and provided with hot meals.Following the crash of Saratov's AN-148 in Moscow, see Crash: Saratov A148 at Moscow on Feb 11th 2018, lost height after departure, pitot heatings off, Russia's Ministry of Transport had issued instruction to the Civil Aviation Authority to suspend all operations on all aircraft types operated by Saratov Airlines and check the compliance with airworthiness on AN-148s of other operators. The Civil Aviation Authority however suspended only the AN-148 operations by Saratov Airlines and limited the validity of the Air Operators Certificate until April 27th 2018 permitting the airline to continue operate their Yak 42s and Embraer ERJ-190s. The airline thus announced that they had a valid air operators certificate and were operating their Yak 42s and E190s.
A UTAir Boeing 737-500, registration VP-BFW performing flight UT-382 from St. Petersburg to Moscow Vnukovo (Russia) with 109 passengers and 5 crew, was cleared for takeoff from St. Petersburg's runway 10L, the crew was accelerating the engines for takeoff, when tower cancelled the takeoff clearance. The crew rejected takeoff and held the position. The aircraft departed a few minutes later.Rosaviatsia reported a bird control vehicle was still on runway 10L when tower cleared the aircraft for takeoff, tower subsequently cancelled the takeoff clearance.
A Transavia Boeing 737-800, registration PH-HSG performing flight HV-5952 from Lisbon (Portugal) to Amsterdam (Netherlands) with 175 passengers and 6 crew, lined up Lisbon's runway 21 at intersection U5 and was accelerating for takeoff with the captain being pilot flying when both flight crew noticed just prior to V1 that their takeoff run was longer than expected. The crew continued takeoff, rotated at Vr and the aircraft became airborne 430 meters/1400 feet short of the runway end. The flight continued to Amsterdam for a safe landing without further incident.The Dutch Safety Board released their final report in English and Dutch combining this occurrence as well as another occurrence in Groningen, see Report: Transavia B738 at Groningen on Sep 18th 2014, insufficient takeoff performance concluding:In both incidents, the flight crew did not select additional thrust after realizing the take-off roll was longer than usual. Other investigation reports of performance incidents show that additional thrust is not selected in the majority of the cases. The selection of additional thrust during the take-off roll in performance incidents is not trained in flight simulators. This lack of training makes it less likely that flight crews select additional thrust in a time critical situation, such as a take-off made with an erroneous take-off performance calculation.Direct causesIn the Lisbon incident an incorrect runway and take-off position selection in the EFB performance tool by the flight crew caused the insufficient thrust setting.The errors could propagate because there were no adequate crosschecks in place to detect the errors. A crosscheck regarding the TOW on the bugcard was lacking in the Groningen incident. Contributing factors of the selection error in the Lisbon incident were:- the large number of data entries and transfers;- the ergonomics of the EFB performance module;- the ambiguous runway take-off position naming system at the airport.- the large variation in take-off parameters due to the performance optimization of the EFB, which decreases the chance for flight crews to develop a feel for the values of take-off performance parameters.The DSB analysed:The aircraft departed from runway 21 position 3 (U5 intersection) as it was the preferred departure position with runway 21 in use. The runway length from this position was 2,410 m. This is sufficient for take-off with a Boeing 737-800 under normal conditions.However, the take-off performance was erroneously calculated for a take-off from runway 03 position 3, from which the available TODA was 1120 m longer. As a consequence the available runway length was less than anticipated in the performance calculation and the subsequent thrust setting was not sufficient to meet the required safety margins. The fact that the remaining runway length at lift-off (430 m) was 211 m more than the calculated distance according to Boeing can be attributed to the fact that the calculations use conservative assumptions.The runway selection errorIn the EFB take-off performance module, both pilots inadvertently selected position 3 on the first page of the runway/identifier selection field. This was take-off position 3 of runway 03 instead of take-off position 3 of runway 21.Runways often have multiple intersections available for take-off that pilots have to choose from. After selecting the correct runway, the identifier is the final criterion which determines the correct take-off position. The runway-identifier combination is a single selection in the EFB. At most airports the identifier field contains a unique character/ number combination (e.g. the runway intersection designator). Therefore it is likely that, in selecting the runway-identifier combination, the pilots in this case focused on the identifier instead of the runway number. Also, as was stated by one of the pilots, the layout of the selection window draws the focus to the identifier, as it clearly stands out with the blank spaces around the identifier. At Lisbon Airport, the runway identifiers were identical for both runway 03 and runway 21. There were a position 1, 2 and 3 for runway 03 as well as a position 1, 2 and 3 for runway 21. These positions marked different intersections. This made the flight crew susceptible to making a selection error.The EFB displays the runway numbers and identifiers in a sequential order. As the selection field can only display a maximum of five runway-identifier combinations, the only PSN3 on this page was position 3 of runway 03. The pilots needed to scroll down to view the remaining options. As they saw the first PSN3 in the list, it is likely they thought that the this PSN was the correct one. In addition to this, pilots stated during interviews that runway 21 was rarely in use. Runway 03 was the runway both pilots usually landed and took off from at Lisbon Airport.Contributing factors to the runway selection errorTake-off position identifiersThe EFB airport data file uses the airport data from the national AIP as source. Therefore the take-off position identifier names in the EFB were also ambiguous. Although ICAO Annex 14 Aerodromes does not provide requirements for the naming of take-off positions, most airports use a logical and unique naming system for aerodrome manoeuvring areas, such as taxiways and ramps.The fact that the same position numbers are used for take-off positions on different runways in Lisbon increases the chance for errors, as proven by this incident and a previous incident with an Airbus A319. During this investigation, Lisbon Airport changed the intersection names. The revised take-off intersection names are not conform the recommendations of the ACI Runway Safety Handbook. Furthermore, the revision of the take-off intersection names did not result in a unique naming of the take-off intersection positions. At present, a PSN M is available for runway 03 as well as runway 35. Therefore, there still is a potential for selecting the wrong runway in the take-off performance calculation in the EFB.Fatigue No indications have been found that fatigue has been a contributing factor in the calculation error.EFB operation and workloadThe EFB in use by the operator requires a number of manual data entries and data transfers, not only for operational, but also for administrative purposes. Pilots have to check, amongst others, crew data, flight sector data and aircraft data and make corrections where necessary. Passenger and load information has to be entered for the load and balance calculation. The input of airport and weather data is required for the take-off performance calculations. The data output has to be transferred to the bugcard and the FMC (see Figure 8 for a visualisation of the workflow).Some information entered in the EFB is already available in the computer systems of the operator (e.g. catering information, flight type, additional equipment), however this information does not get automatically uploaded or transferred. The first officer stated during an interview that he often had to postpone non-essential tasks, which are of an administrative nature, until after take-off because of time pressure. This disrupts the regular workflow for which the EFB has been designed. The captain stated during an interview that because he had only recently been promoted to captain he felt susceptible to time pressure. The turn around time at Lisbon was scheduled to be 35 minutes. During a large portion of this time one member of the flight crew is required to be outside to supervise refuelling of the aircraft. This leaves only a short period of time where both pilots are on the flight deck doing preparations for the following flight.Although the EFB reduces the number of calculations compared to the manual load and trim procedure (as in the Groningen incident), it still requires a large amount of manual data entries and data transfers. The operator is planning to incorporate a further integration of these functions in the next phase of the EFB, which will decrease the number of data entries.Error propagation and crosschecking proceduresCrosschecking procedures The main barrier against errors in the performance calculation is the crosscheck between the outcome of the two independent performance calculations as described in the FCOM and the FCTM, see paragraph 2.4.2. As both pilots made the same input error, the output was the same as well. For that reason the existing crosscheck on the output parameters was not adequate to detect this type of input error.A small deviation in the input parameters, such as for instance the wind component, can make a substantial difference in the output. According to the flight crew, pilots tend to communicate the input parameters before entering them in the EFB to facilitate crosschecking at the end of the performance calculation. This increases the chance of common input errors being made and as such it reduces the effect of the crosscheck after completion of the performance calculation.Once the performance calculation is completed, the performance module is closed and the EFB is used for different purposes. During taxi-out, the airport map or departure page of the Lido chart module is usually selected on the EFB. Due to the different software modules, the performance calculation results are not readily available during taxi as the EFB is then showing navigational charts. Therefore, it is not convenient for pilots to open the performance module for reference during taxi.The EFB take-off performance calculation page incorporates a print button. However, in contrast to its name, the print button only stores the calculated data, it does not send any information to the onboard printer. A printed copy would make the performance calculation data readily available for crosschecking or reference purposes prior to take-off.During the interviews the pilots mentioned that they have developed their own crosschecking strategy after the incident. This includes paying extra attention to the runway designator during the performance calculation process and a review of the performance data prior to take-off, including the runway/intersection used for the performance calculation. The manuals and procedures do not describe a particular crosscheck to this extent. The fact that pilots stated they developed their own crosschecking strategies when using the EFB is indicative that the existing company crosschecking strategies at the time of the incident were inadequate.Experience and exposureThe EFB take-off performance calculation is not based on the concept of a balanced field take-off as used in the TL-tables and uses excess runway length for an improved climb performance whenever feasible. The software adjusts the decision speeds to achieve the maximum thrust reduction/maximum assumed temperature to conserve engine life. Under seemingly similar circumstances, the take-off configuration and or decision speeds can differ considerably. As a consequence pilots awareness and feel for numbers is reduced and a deviation from standard values will not easily be noticed. For instance, the awareness of the relation between the most relevant performance parameter values; TOW, thrust reduction, and TODA, is reduced.
A Transavia Boeing 737-800, registration PH-HZD performing flight HV-143 from Groningen to Rotterdam (Netherlands) with 173 passengers and 6 crew, lined up Groningen's runway 05 at intersection S3 and was accelerating for takeoff with the captain being pilot flying when the captain noticed above 80 knots that the acceleration was not as expected. The captain assessed that insufficient runway was available to reject takeoff and continued the takeoff. The first officer suggested to rotate early, the captain rotated the aircraft at Vr, the aircraft became airborne 60 meters/200 feet short of the runway end. The flight continued to Rotterdam for a safe landing without further incident.The Dutch Safety Board released their final report in English and Dutch combining this occurrence as well as another occurrence in Lisbon, see Report: Transavia B738 at Lisbon on Dec 3rd 2015, insufficient takeoff performance concluding:In both incidents, the flight crew did not select additional thrust after realizing the take-off roll was longer than usual. Other investigation reports of performance incidents show that additional thrust is not selected in the majority of the cases. The selection of additional thrust during the take-off roll in performance incidents is not trained in flight simulators. This lack of training makes it less likely that flight crews select additional thrust in a time critical situation, such as a take-off made with an erroneous take-off performance calculation.Direct causesIn the Groningen incident, the insufficient thrust setting was the consequence of a miscalculation on the bugcard.The errors could propagate because there were no adequate crosschecks in place to detect the errors. A crosscheck regarding the TOW on the bugcard was lacking in the Groningen incident. Contributing factors to the calculation error in the Groningen incident were:- the large number of calculations, data entries and data transfers;- the lack of guidelines regarding which source should be used for the weight in the take-off performance calculation.- lack of guidelines regarding the purpose of the bugcard, leading to it being used for a calculation whilst it is meant solely as a reference chart.The DSB analysed:The performance calculation was based on a TOW that was 10 t lower than the actual TOW of 62.9 t and a wind component of 0 kt. The actual take-off thrust, resulting from the performance calculation, was therefore less than the required take-off thrust setting. As a consequence none of the required safety margins were met. An engine failure at V1 would have resulted in a runway excursion. Even without an engine failure, the available runway length was 68 m too short for the required take-off run distance according to aircraft manufacturer Boeing. Boeing calculated the take-off distances for the same thrust setting and conditions as the incident flight. The fact that the aircraft became airborne approximately 60 m before the end of the runway can be attributed to the fact that these calculations use conservative assumptions.The take-off speeds were calculated for the correct take-off weight as they were derived from the FMC, which was programmed with the correct weight figures. However, the erroneous assumed temperature of 60 degrees Celsius was also programmed into the FMC.From the pilots perspective intersection S3 of runway 05 was a valid choice for take-off. Their performance calculation, using the erroneous 10 t low takeoff weight, showed that both a take-off from the beginning of the runway and from the intersection were possible with the same thrust reduction. Taking-off from the intersection saved time and improved the flow of traffic, as no back track was required on the runway.The weight used for the performance calculation was the weight as written on the bugcard, which was 52,9 t. Performance penalties for the use of bleed air and a lower than standard QNH were correctly applied to this weight. Hence, the weight used in the performance tables was 55,5 t. The flight crew used the zero wind column in the performance tables to find the maximum assumed temperature at which the engines would provide sufficient thrust for a safe takeoff. This showed a temperature of 60 degrees Celsius, which was the maximum temperature noted in the performance tables. When entering the performance tables with the correct takeoff weight, adjusted for performance penalties to 65,5 t, the tables show an assumed temperature of 30 degrees Celsius. The thrust setting corresponding to an assumed temperature of 30 degrees Celsius is significantly higher than the thrust setting corresponding to an assumed temperature of 60 degrees Celsius and would have been sufficient for a safe takeoff in windless conditions.The wind, according to the ATIS, was from direction 100 degrees with a steady component of 5 kt, but variable in direction between 060 and 170 degrees and variable in wind speed between 3 and 11 kt. This means that wind from direction 170 degrees with a speed of 11 kt was possible. As runway 05 was in use there was a possibility of a 120 degree angle between the runway heading and the wind direction. At a wind speed of 11 kt this would create a tailwind component of 5,5 kt. Entering the performance tables for a 5 kt tailwind component and the erroneous 55,5 t takeoff weight shows a maximum assumed temperature of 52 degrees Celsius. When entering the performance tables for a 5 kt tailwind and the correct weight of 65,5 t, the performance tables show a temperature of 8 degrees Celsius. As the outside air temperature was 24 degrees Celsius, a takeoff would then not have been possible from intersection S3. A takeoff from the beginning of runway 05 would then have been required. The operators performance manual does not accurately describe which wind direction and speed should be taken into account in case of a variable wind direction and speed.The ACMS take-off data (Appendix C, Figure 1) shows that groundspeed and calibrated airspeed during the take-off roll were the same, or that calibrated airspeed was higher, indicating no wind or headwind. Just before rotation, between 43 and 47 seconds into the event, the calibrated airspeed is lower than the groundspeed by approximately 4 kt. This indicates tailwind. Although this period is short, a tailwind does negatively influence the performance of the aircraft. The effect of the short period of tailwind however, is minor compared to the effect of the erroneous take-off weight used for the performance calculation.Contributing factors to the calculation errorAlthough the bugcard is not designed as a chart on which calculations are to be completed, there is no description of the exact purpose of the bugcard as a reference chart on which only results of calculations are to be noted in the manuals of the operator. The TOW on the bugcard can be calculated by adding the take-off fuel weight to the ZFW33 or can be transferred directly from the LTS. Choosing to make a TOW calculation on the bugcard is unnecessary, as it has already been calculated on the LTS, and it presents an extra possibility to make a calculation error. Nevertheless this method could be used because of the lacking procedures describing the use of the bugcard. Furthermore, the FMC also displays the TOW after the ZFW as calculated on the LTS has been entered into the FMC. This value could also have been transferred onto the bugcard.Neither the manuals (FCOM, FCTM), nor the operator, prescribe which TOW source should be used as the source for the performance calculation. In interviews the flight crew stated that pilots develop personal strategies with respect to which TOW is being used for the performance calculation. In this case the pilots used the incorrectly calculated TOW of 52.9 t from the bugcard as source for the performance calculation. Both pilots stated they were instructed to use the TOW from the bugcard for the performance calculation during their initial training with the operator.Completing the weight and balance, performance calculation and FMC procedures required over twenty manual entries, data transfers and calculations to be performed by the flight crew. At each individual step there was a potential for making an error. The large number of steps, performed during the flight preparation process, increases the chance for errors.No indications have been found that flight crew fatigue has been a contributing factor in the calculation error.
A Piedmont Airlines de Havilland Dash 8-100 on behalf of US Airways, registration N815EX performing flight PDT-4206/US-4206 from Harrisburg,PA to Philadelphia,PA (USA) with 20 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from when the aircraft went through a flock of geese and received a number of bird strike resulting in damage to the right hand propeller and a broken passenger window. The aircraft rejected takeoff. A replacement Dash 8-100 registration N814EX reached Phildelphia with a delay of 50 minutes.The FAA reported: "US AIR EXPRESS FLIGHT 4206 DE HAVILLAND DH8A AIRCRAFT ON DEPARTURE, STRUCK A FLOCK OF GEESE AND SUSTAINED A BROKEN WINDSHIELD." The occurrence was rated an incident.Photographic evidence shows the aircraft received damage to the right hand propeller and a passenger window adjacent to the right hand propeller as well as a dent in the fuselage skin and additional panels protecting the fuselage from ice separating from the propellers.On Oct 28th 2017 (!), more than 3 years after the occurrence, the NTSB released a preliminary information stating they have opened an investigation into the occurrence rated an accident. A docket has not yet been opened.On Mar 10th 2018 the NTSB released their brief final report (a docket was not opened) concluding the probable cause of the accident was:the airplanes collision with geese during the takeoff roll.The NTSB described the events:The captain was the pilot flying and the first officer was the pilot monitoring. According to the flight crew, about 15 seconds into the takeoff roll and prior to V1, the captain observed a large group of geese flying from right to left in front of the airplane. He immediately initiated a rejected takeoff as the airplane impacted multiple geese on the front windshield and the right engine propeller, which caused a severe vibration. The flight crew shut down the right engine as the airplane slowed and returned to the gate. Examination of the airplane indicated damage to the right propeller, a broken passenger window, and damage to the fuselage skin and stringers near the broken window.The propeller damage:The broken passenger window:
A Braathens Regional Avro RJ-100, registration SE-DSU performing positioning flight TF-9805 from Stockholm Arlanda to Stockholm Bromma (Sweden) with just crew on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Stockholm's runway 01L at 12:58L (11:58Z) but veered right off the runway at low speed and rejected takeoff. The aircraft came to a stop off the right edge of the runway about abeam of the PAPIs about 340 meters/1100 feet down the runway.A SAS Airbus A330 had already lined up runway 01L behind the departing RJ-100, subsequently taxied past the Avro to runway 01R, where the A330 finally departed.SE-DSU had earlier diverted to Stockholm's Arlanda Airport while on flight TF-125 from Malmo (Sweden) to Stockholm Bromma.Related NOTAM:A0156/18 NOTAMNQ) ESAA/QMRLC/IV/NBO/A /000/999/5939N01755E005A) ESSA B) 1802271400 C) 1802271600 ESTE) RWY 01L/19R CLOSED BTN Y1 AND Y2Metars:ESSA 271350Z 03016KT CAVOK M12/M17 Q1043 R01L/520168 R01R/720166 R08/////// NOSIG=COR ESSA 271320Z 04016KT CAVOK M12/M17 Q1043 R01L/520168 R01R/720166 R08/////// NOSIG=ESSA 271250Z 04015KT 9999 FEW011 M12/M18 Q1043 R01L/520168 R01R/720173 R08/////// NOSIG=ESSA 271220Z 06016KT 9999 VCSH FEW018 M12/M16 Q1043 R01L/520168 R01R/520173 R08/////// NOSIG=ESSA 271150Z 05017KT 9999 -SN FEW010 SCT022 M13/M17 Q1042 R01L/520168 R01R/520173 R08/////// NOSIG=ESSA 271120Z 04018KT 9999 FEW015 M12/M17 Q1042 R01L/520168 R01R/420171 R08/////// NOSIG=ESSA 271050Z 03020KT 9999 FEW015 M12/M17 Q1042 R01L/520168 R01R/720171 R08/////// NOSIG=ESSA 271020Z 04018KT 5000 FEW018 M13/M17 Q1042 R01L/520168 R01R/720171 R08/////// NOSIG=ESSA 270950Z 03019KT CAVOK M13/M17 Q1041 R01L/520168 R01R/720171 R08/////// NOSIG=ESSA 270920Z 04018KT 9999 NSC M13/M17 Q1041 R01L/520168 R01R/720171 R08/////// NOSIG=The SAS A330's passenger photo (Photo: Axel Öberg):
An Air India Airbus A321-200, registration VT-PPL performing flight AI-607 from Mumbai to Bangalore (India), was accelerating for takeoff from Mumbai's runway 27 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 100 knots over ground) due to severe engine (CFM56) vibrations. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The airline reported the crew rejected takeoff due to an engine glitch.A replacement Airbus A320-200N registration VT-EXG reached Bangalore with a delay of 3.25 hours.
A Delta Airlines Airbus A330-300, registration N814NW performing flight DL-259 from Amsterdam (Netherlands) to Boston,MA (USA), was cleared for takeoff from Amsterdam's runway 09 and was accelerating for takeoff.An Easyjet Airbus A319-100, registration G-EZIO performing flight U2-7976 from Rome Fiumicino (Italy) to Amsterdam (Netherlands), was on final approach to Amsterdam's runway 06 cleared to land on the runway, when the crew elected to go around from low height (about 100 feet AGL) due to the approach in gusting winds having become unstable.Due to the late go around tower needed to cancel the takeoff clearance of DL-259, the crew rejected takeoff at low speed and vacated the runway at the first high speed turn off about 1300 meters down the runway.The A319 landed safely on their second approach about 12 minutes later. The A333 positioned back the holding point runway 09, departed about 30 minutes after the rejected takeoff and reached Boston with a total delay of 100 minutes.Metars:EHAM 011255Z 08021KT 050V110 CAVOK M02/M13 Q1007 NOSIG=EHAM 011225Z 08022G34KT 040V110 CAVOK M02/M13 Q1007 NOSIG=EHAM 011155Z 07023KT CAVOK M03/M13 Q1007 NOSIG=EHAM 011125Z 08021KT 050V110 CAVOK M03/M13 Q1008 NOSIG=EHAM 011055Z 08024KT 050V110 CAVOK M03/M13 Q1008 NOSIG=EHAM 011025Z 08025G35KT 050V110 CAVOK M03/M13 Q1009 NOSIG=EHAM 010955Z 08022G34KT 040V110 CAVOK M04/M13 Q1009 NOSIG=EHAM 010925Z 09021G32KT 050V120 CAVOK M05/M13 Q1010 NOSIG=EHAM 010855Z 08023KT 050V110 CAVOK M05/M13 Q1010 NOSIG=EHAM 010825Z 08021KT 040V110 CAVOK M06/M13 Q1010 NOSIG=
An Iberia Airbus A340-600, registration EC-IQR performing flight IB-6400 from Mexico City (Mexico) to Madrid,SP (Spain), was accelerating for takeoff from Mexico City's runway 05R when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 70 knots over ground) due to an engine (Trent 556) indication. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.A passenger reported the captain announced there was a malfunction in one of the engine performance indicators, the system needed to be reset. The aircraft departed about 90 minutes after the rejected takeoff.The occurrence aircraft departed Mexico City about 80 minutes after the rejected takeoff and reached Madrid with a delay of 70 minutes.
An Air Canada Airbus A330-300, registration C-GHLM performing flight AC-879 from Zurich (Switzerland) to Toronto,ON (Canada) with 268 passengers and 11 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Zurich's runway 16 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 53 knots over ground) reporting the left hand engine (Trent 772) had stalled. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.A replacement Boeing 787-900 registration C-FGDX was dispatched from Toronto to Zurich as flight AC-7064 but was called back to Toronto while enroute at FL410 overhead Newfoundland when it became clear the aircraft would not make it into Zurich before the night curfew.The occurrence aircraft was repaired, departed the following day and reached Toronto with a delay of 23.5 hours.
A Thomson Airways Boeing 737-800, registration G-FDZJ performing charter flight BY-2453 from Malta (Malta) to Manchester,EN (UK) with 136 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Malta's runway 13. After reaching Vr the captain (39, ATPL, 9,699 hours total, 782 hours on type) applied normal backpressure on the control column, however, the aircraft did not rotate. The commander applied more back pressure until the control column was deflected about 75% of its maximum travel, then the aircraft began to slowly rotate and became airborne about 300 meters before the end of the runway. Once the aircraft had settled in the climb, the captain trimmed the control forces out and the aircraft continued to Manchester for a safe landing.The AAIB released their bulletin concluding the probable cause of the serious incident was:The aircraft took off with incorrect stabiliser trim set because an incorrect MACTOW was shown on the load sheet. This occurred because the seating position of the passengers was not passed to the handling agent. The handling agent assumed an even distribution of passengers within the cabin, when the actual loading created a forward bias.The AAIB reported the aircraft was conducting an intersection takeoff from taxiway F departing with flaps 10, V1 was computed at 141 KIAS, Vr at 142 KIAS and V2 at 145 KIAS. The stabilizer trim had been set to 4.5 units based on the load sheet information. Following takeoff the commander trimmed the aircraft to 7 units.The loadsheet had computed a takeoff weight of 65.6 tons and the MAC for takeoff at 23.4%.The flight was a charter flight on behalf of cruise ship organisation. The passengers were allocated their seats by the cruise ship operator, who then reported the passenger loading details to the handling agent in Malta, including number of male and female passengers and infants, however, without seat allocation as the flights usually are full. The handling agent assumed an even distribution, however, this assumption was incorrect as the actual passenger seating produced a forward bias. Using the actual passenger distribution the investigation determined the MAC was at 17% instead of the 23.5% resulting from an even distribution.
A Westjet Boeing 737-700, registration C-GWBX performing flight WS-2755 from Nassau (Bahamas) to Toronto,ON (Canada) with 124 passengers and 5 crew, had been cleared for takeoff from Nassau's runway 14 and was accelerating for takeoff when the crew spotted another aircraft entering the runway without clearance. The crew rejected takeoff at low speed and informed tower.The Canadian TSB reported WS-2755 was re-cleared for takeoff once the conflicting traffic was clear of the runway.
An Air Canada Airbus A330-300, registration C-GFAJ performing flight AC-833 from Brussels (Belgium) to Montreal,QC (Canada) with 179 passengers, was accelerating for takeoff from runway 07R when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 90 knots over ground). The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway via taxiway C1 about 2200 meters down the runway before becoming disabled after a number of right hand main tyres deflated. The airline reported the aircraft sustained damage to its wheels when it rejected takeoff. On Feb 7th 2017 the Canadian TSB reported the crew heard a loud bang and received a BRAKE ECAM message, rejected takeoff at 82 KIAS, declared PAN. Deceleration did not occur as expected due to one thrust reverser not deploying as result of the loss of green hydraulic system. The aircraft vacated the runway via taxiway C1. Debris was found scattered along the full length of the runway including intersection with runway 01, the forward outboard right hand main wheel had failed and separated. There was damage to the #1 engine nose cowl, the right hand main wheel bogie needs to be replaced. On Feb 10th 2017 the Belgium AIB reported the crew rejected takeoff at 82 KIAS after a loud bang was heard and an ECAM Brakes warning activated. The deceleration did not occur as expected due to the right hand thrust reverser not deploying as result of the failure of the green hydraulic system. The forward outboard right hand wheel had separated. The occurrence happened shortly before another aircraft, a KLM aircraft diverting from Amsterdam to Brussels due to weather conditions in Amsterdam, declared PAN PAN due to being short on fuel. The occurrence was rated a serious incident and is being investigated by Belgium's AIB.On Feb 5th 2018 the Belgian AIB released their interim report stating that the outboard roller bearing of wheel #4 had failed. The AIB wrote:The forward right wheel of the RH Main landing gear was missing, remained only the axle and the brake. A separated half of a half wheel rim was still present. The hydraulic lines were cut, and fluid was leaking.The first part found on the ground was the axle cover. It was found on taxiway Zulu, more or less at the same point the airplane was taxiing when smoke was first spotted. (turn between OUT 10 and Zoulou).Small parts, including some coming from the bearing (rollers,..) were found on Runway 07R, from the start of the runway up to H. From that point, further towards the half length of the runway, bigger parts were found, including a half wheel rim between intersection C3 and C2.The tyre was found nearly intact in the grass located right side of runway 01 north of F2.The AIB reported the crew noticed that they had to apply more power than usual for line up, however, the terrain is uphill. During the takeoff run between 60 and 100 knots the crew heard a loud bang and immediately after released an ECAM warning "brake release", the captain ordered to reject takeoff. The braking was not as effective as expected, the crew deployed the thrust reversers, the right hand thrust reverser did not deploy.

An Air Canada Airbus A320-200, registration C-FDQV performing flight AC-221 from Calgary,AB to Vancouver,BC (Canada), had been cleared for takeoff from runway 29 and was accelerating through 100 KIAS when the crew spotted a Swearingen SA-226 crossing the runway. As the SA-226 was already more than half across the runway, the A320 crew continued takeoff and continued to destination without further incident.The Canadian TSB reported the SA-226 had been cleared to cross the runway when the A320 was about 2200 feet into the takeoff roll. The Canadian TSB opened an investigation into the occurrence rated "risk of collision".On Feb 5th 2018 the TSB released their final report concluding the probable cause of the serious incident was:Findings as to causes and contributing factors- The runway incursion occurred after the combined ground controller cleared C-FGEW to cross Runway 29 while Air Canada flight 221 was departing on Runway 29.- Due to a strong habit intrusion error, the combined ground controller reverted to the frequently practised routine of instructing the aircraft to cross Runway 29 without prior coordination with the combined tower controller.- The infrequent use of Runway 29 during the day, together with the absence of relevant training scenarios or simulation of Runway 29 operations, meant that controllers rarely encountered situations where the need to coordinate prior to executing crossings of Runway 29 was reinforced.- The runway jurisdiction system did not provide a sufficiently compelling cue to ensure that the combined ground controller did not revert to the well-practised routine of clearing aircraft across Runway 29 without coordination.Findings as to risk- If proposed safety actions are not tracked to completion, there is an increased likelihood that identified safety risks will not be effectively mitigated.The TSB analysed:The combined ground controller was aware that the tower controller had jurisdiction of Runway 29, and that arrivals and departures were taking place on that runway. In the 15 minutes preceding the occurrence, the combined ground controller had received a transfer-of-position-responsibility briefing, prompted by the change in runway configuration. The combined ground controller had issued taxi instructions for ACA221 to proceed to Runway 29, and had provided taxi instructions to 2 other aircraft that had already landed on Runway 29.The combined ground controller intended to coordinate with the combined tower controller prior to clearing C-FGEW to cross Runway 29. However, at the time when C-FGEW was approaching Runway 29, the combined ground controller automatically instructed the aircraft to cross without coordinating with the combined tower controller.Since the introduction of the parallel runway operation, Runway 29 has been used infrequently for daytime operations. It is usually under the jurisdiction of ground controllers, and aircraft frequently cross it. As a result, controllers have developed a strong schema for automatically clearing aircraft across without coordination. Further, in the moments before clearing C-FGEW to cross Runway 29, the combined ground controllers attention had been devoted to ensuring that there would be no conflict between C-FGEW and the CRJ900 at the intersection of taxiways A and J.All of the criteria for a strong habit intrusion error were present. The controller was carrying out a well-practised task in familiar surroundings, he intended to depart from routine, and to do so, he had to overcome a strong schema for the usual pattern of actions.29 In addition, the controllers attention was devoted to another aspect of the task at the moment when an attentional check should have been expected. Due to a strong habit intrusion error, the combined ground controller reverted to the frequently practised routine of instructing the aircraft to cross Runway 29 without prior coordination with the combined tower controller.While this type of error is common, it is also predictable and can be prevented. Potential mitigations include memory aids that ensure that attentional checks are conducted at the appropriate time, and training that reinforces the alternate schema through practice.
A Croatia Airlines Airbus A319-100, registration 9A-CTG performing flight OU-470 from Zagreb (Croatia) to Paris Charles de Gaulle (France), was accelerating for takeoff from Zagreb's runway 05 when the crew rejected takeoff due to an engine (CFM56) indication. The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway at taxiway C about 1000 meters/3300 feet down the runway.A replacement A319-100 registration 9A-CTI reached Paris with a delay of 2.5 hours.Avioradar reported ADS-B data suggested 9A-CTG reached 96 knots over ground before slowing down again.The airline reported the aircraft rejected takeoff due to an indication of a technical failure in one of the engines.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Zagreb about 13 hours after the rejected takeoff.
A Brussels Airlines Airbus A330-300, registration OO-SFO performing flight SN-247 from Freetown (Sierra Leone) to Brussels (Belgium), was accelerating for takeoff from Freetown when the left hand engines (CF6) surged prompting the crew to reject takeoff.

A Fastjet Embraer ERJ-190, registration 5H-FJI performing flight FN-148 from Mwanza to Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) with 83 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff at about 21:05L (18:05Z) when the crew noticed a person in the middle of the active runway, attempted some limited evasive maneouver and continued takeoff. Climbing out of the airport the crew informed ATC, who confirmed a seriously injured person on the runway. After safe landing in Dar es Salaam the crew received information that the person on the runway in Mwanza had succumbed to the injuries. The aircraft did not receive any damage.The airline confirmed the accident advising their passengers that an investigation has been opened into the accident, the aircraft remains unavailable due to the investigation forcing a number of flight cancellations on Jan 18th. Fastjet wrote: "Fastjet would like to extend its sincere condolences to the family and friends of the dead."Tanzania's Airport Authority reported a male, unknown identity, has died when he hit the departing aircraft on the runway. All security procedures had been followed. However, the long-term lack of a fence due to building and aerodrome enhancements works might have contributed to the person getting onto the runway.

A Brussels Airlines Airbus A330-200, registration OO-SFZ performing flight SN-552 from Toronto,ON (Canada) to Brussels (Belgium) with 251 passengers and 10 crew, was climbing out of Toronto shortly after takeoff, when a number of passengers and cabin crew located in the aft cabin began to feel unwell, no odour, fumes or visible smoke were detected. Cabin crew reseated the affected passengers into the forward cabin, the affected cabin crew were administered oxygen and recovered. The flight continued to Brussels for a safe landing. Medical services awaited the aircraft and examined the affected passengers and crew. Cabin crew reported they suffered from nausea, palpitations, headache and abnormal blood pressure, they felt a metallic taste.The Aviation Herald learned of the occurrence on Nov 30th 2017 and contacted the airline. A first reply on Dec 1st indicated that more time was needed, the airline reported past the weekend on Dec 4th, that 5 passengers and 4 cabin crew in the aft cabin, only a few seat rows were affected, felt unwell shortly after departure as if there was lack of fresh air, no (oil) smell or fumes were present in the cabin. Cabin crew reseated the passengers in those seat rows in the front of the cabin, where no such air flow issue existed the passengers recovered. The cabin air flow rate was increased as well. A doctor examined the affected after arrival in Brussels, all passengers continued their journeys. The crew were sent to an aviation medical service for examination, tests were conducted. The aircraft was examined involving Airbus into the troubleshooting, it was concluded the lack of air flow was probably the result of a temperature sensor in the cabin that malfunctioned due to dust in its surrounding (air supply filters). Due to the wrong measurement as result of the dust the sensor instructed the air conditioning system to reduce the air flow. There had been a similiar occurrence in another (non Brussels Airlines) aircraft before.Belgium's Mobility (AAIB) have so far not responded to an inquiry by The Aviation Herald.The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground for 31 hours, then returned to service.

A short time later the aircraft was cleared for takeoff runway 15 from intersection D2, departed and landed safely in Paris.The French BEA reported on Oct 19th 2017, that the crew did not receive any explanation as to why the takeoff clearance was cancelled, however, observed another aircraft landing on crossing runway 11. After the landing they were cleared for takeoff from intersection D2. The crew also was not aware runway 11/29 was open. Poland's PKBWL rated the occurrence a serious incident and opened an investigation.
A Eurowings Airbus A320-200, registration D-AIPW performing flight EW-79 from Leipzig to Cologne (Germany), was accelerating for takeoff from Leipig's runway 26R when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed due to a bird strike and stopped on the runway. Emergency services responded, the aircraft was subsequently towed to the apron with the fire engines in trail.Following maintenance the aircraft was able to depart about 2 hours later and reached Cologne with a total delay of 100 minutes.
A Provincial Airlines de Havilland Dash 8-300, registration C-GYCV performing flight PB-907 from St. John's,NL to Saint Anthony,NL (Canada) with 35 passengers and 4 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from runway 29 when the left hand engine (PW123B) experienced an overtorque condition due to an uncommanded feather of the left hand propeller. The crew rejected takeoff, shut the engine down and stopped the aircraft on the runway. The crew subsequently backtracked the runway and vacated the runway via runway 16 about 900 meters/3000 feet down runway 29.A replacement Dash 8-100 reached Saint Anthony with a delay of 2:15 hours.The Canadian TSB reported maintenance replaced propeller, the propeller auto-feather controller and the engine torque sensing unit in accordance with manufacturer's instructions.
An American Airlines Boeing 737-800, registration N879NN performing flight AA-994 from Managua (Nicaragua) to Miami,FL (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Managua's runway 10 when a vulture impacted one of the engines. The crew continued takeoff, climbed the aircraft to 5000 feet and returned to Managua for a safe landing on runway 10 about 10 minutes after departure.Passengers reported there was suddenly a deafening noise while the aircraft was still in the takeoff roll, which ceased shortly after the aircraft had become airborne. Shortly after the captain announced they were returning to Managua due to an engine failure, it may have been possible that the engine was damaged by a bird strike. After landing the crew confirmed that a vulture was found, the engine was severly damaged.
An EAT Leipzig Airbus A300-600, registration D-AEAF performing freight flight QY-2197 from Amsterdam (Netherlands) to Leipzig (Germany), was accelerating for takeoff from Amsterdam's runway 24 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 125 knots over ground) reporting they suspected they had hit something or had burst a tyre. The crew requested emergency services to attend the aircraft. The aircraft came to a stop about half way down the runway, emergency services reported seeing nothing unusual, no burst tyre, no fire or smoke from the landing gear. The crew subsequently taxied the aircraft off the runway back to the apron.The occurrence aircraft departed about 3 hours later and reached Leipzig.

An Aircraft Sales and Services Ltd Pakistan Beech 1900D, registration AP-BII performed a charter flight from Karachi to Sui (Pakistan) with 18 passengers and 3 crew (two flight crew and one engineer in the passenger cabin), was accelerating for takeoff from Karachi's runway 25L, V1 had been computed at 104 and V2 at 106 KIAS. The captain (58, ATPL, 2,885 hours total, 717 hours on type) was pilot flying, the first officer (49, ATPL, 3,614 hours total, 245 hours on type) was pilot monitoring, the first officer was actually rated qualified captain on the Beech 1900D too. Both engines were set to maximum power and accelerated to 1691 respective 1699 rpm and developed 3401 ft/lbs respective 3211 ft/lbs torque. About 5 seconds after both engines had reached their maximum power the aircraft accelerated through 80 KIAS, the right hand engine at this time began to decrease its rpm while increasing its torque. Over the next 11 seconds the rpm fell to 709 rpm and the torque reached 3896 ft/lbs, then started to fluctuate. At the same time the torque of the left hand engine began to reduce to 2288 ft/lbs without any significant change in rpm which subsequently recovered to 3549 ft/lbs. The aircraft was now at 95 KIAS and not accelerating with the #2 rpm dropping, the first officer announced the aircraft was drifting to the right, the captain replied "continue ... continue". The speed increased to 96 KIAS, when the captain applied left rudder to turn left the airspeed fell to 94 KIAS. Both crew did not recognize that BOTH engines had developed problems and they were still below V1, so that takeoff should have been rejected. The first officer called the power on the left engine should be increased, the aircraft accelerated through 98 KIAS, the captain glanced onto the instruments and wanted to voice concern over the loss of power when the first officer called "V1, rotate" at 101.4 KIAS. The aircraft rotated and became airborne at 102 KIAS, the left engine was produced 1692 rpms and 3540 ft/lbs torque, the right hand engine was producing 800 rpms and 3422 ft/lbs torque. After becoming airborne the airspeed dropped to 101 KIAS, the aircraft continued to drift towards the right. The first officer took control of the aircraft. The airspeed continued to decrease, while decreasing through 98 KIAS the first officer called to select the landing gear up, the gear was selected up by the captain. At that time the right hand engine torque remained near the maximum, but the left hand engine was fluctuating. The aircraft reached 39 feet AGL when the captain called speed and the first officer lowered the nose, the airspeed settled at 100 KIAS. The first officer called to select the flaps up, the flaps were selected up. The aircraft began to immediately lose height but picked up speed. Engine #1 was producing 1692 rpm and 3409 ft/lbs torque, the right hand engine produced 933 rpm and 4699 ft/lbs torque. Descending through 10 feet AGL the aircraft increased through 105 KIAS. The first officer concluded the aircraft was unable to sustain flight and decided to put the aircraft back down on the remaining runway. The aircraft touched down very hard with its belly, the gear had already retracted, about 9000 feet past the runway threshold in the right half of the runway, skidded towards and past the right hand edge of the runway, after travelling around 600 feet past the right hand edge the aircraft returned onto the runway and came to a stop 1050 feet short of the runway end. The captain and a passenger sustained serious backbone injuries, the first officer shut the aircraft down and initiated an evacuation of the aircraft. The captain and the passenger as well as the first officer were taken to a hospital.Pakistan's Safety Investigation Board (SIB) released their final report concluding the probable cause of the accident was:Some internal malfunction of the Propeller Governor Part No. 8210-410 Serial No. 2490719 was the cause of experienced uncommanded auto feather. However, exact cause of the occurrence could not be determined.Continuing take off below V1 speed (104kts) after encountering engine malfunction and after takeoff raising flaps below recommended height (400ft AGL) lead to decrease in lift and unsustainability of flight.The SIB reported: "Due to the hard impact of the aircraft with ground, the captain and one passenger received serious injuries. Both seriously injured persons backbones were fractured necessitating prolonged hospitalization and lengthy treatment involving surgical procedures. Immediately after the accident, the Cockpit Crew (Captain and First Officer), were taken to hospital and necessary medical evaluations were conducted. The results of pertinent medical evaluation were within normal limits." The SIB analysed:At 0323:44 UTC when the aircraft was crossing 96.75 kts of speed during takeoff roll, the PM asked PF to turn left and apply left rudder. From this moment onwards the aircraft speed started to decrease gradually for next six seconds i.e. till 0323:50 UTC and reached 94.82 kts.The cockpit crew could not realize at this stage that there was a problem with both engines and they were still below V1 which, as per pre flight calculation / planning, was 104 kts. The applicable procedure given in Pilot Checklist (B1900 Emergency Procedures) for Engine Failure During Takeoff at or below V1 was not followed which mentions to abort takeoff. Their decision to continue take off with one engine not providing sufficient power at aircraft speed below V1 was not correct.The SIB further analysed with respect to landing the aircraft back:According to First Officers statement, at this time he observed the aircraft not climbing (losing height) and sluggish controls response (due low airspeed) and there was no option other than to make the aircraft land on the remaining runway. So, he attempted to land the aircraft and in that bargain hit the runway surface hard approximately 9000 ft from runway 25L beginning in right half. The aircraft continued to drag on the runway while continuously drifting right for 800 ft before departing towards right side on fair weather strip.After travelling approximately 600 ft on fair weather strip, the aircraft veered towards left and came to final stop on the runway 1050 ft short from end of runway.As the Captain was seriously injured, the First Officer brought Fuel Control Levers, Propeller Levers and Power Levers back; put Battery and Generators Off after the aircraft came to halt. An immediate evacuation of the passengers was carried out.The SIB reported that "The fuel samples from aircraft and oil samples from both engines were drawn and submitted to Perac Research and Development Foundation (PRD) Karachi for analysis. The PRD reports did not reveal any abnormality with fuel and oil of the mishap aircraft."The SIB further reported that although pitot leak tests could not be carried out as the pitot static lines had been damaged in the crash landing it could be determined that both ASIs were generally underreading by 3 knots around takeoff speeds.The SIB analysed:The NTSB FDR report and FDR tabular data file was shared with Pratt & Whitney (PWC) Canada. The PWC report concluded that :FDR data was characteristic of an un-commanded propeller feathering event of No. 2 engine as shown by the sharp propeller speed reduction being concurrent with the torque increase.The SIB analysed:Study of the Propeller Pitch Change Mechanism showed that uncommanded feathering may take place because of Loss of oil pressure, Auto-feather system malfunction or Malfunction of propeller governor.The No. 2 engine was examined by Vector Aerospace Australia. The examination report concluded that there was no anomaly with the engine which could ontribute to the experienced un-commanded auto-feather. The over torque sustained was within limits and no maintenance action was required as per Maintenance Manual. No apparent damage to the engine was found as consequent to the crash landing.The Primary Propeller Governor and Overspeed Governor of No. 2 engine were examined by Woodward Inc, USA. This examination report ascertained that there was no anomaly found which could cause the reported event of un-commanded auto feathering. Although few anomalies were observed at the IDLE settings, however, same cant cause the auto feathering as it had occurred at Max Power Settings of Take Off.Components of Auto Feathering System comprising of two switches (Pressure Switch High and Pressure Switch Low) were subjected to Shop check at M/s PIAC Component Overhaul Shop and found with no discrepancy or anomaly which could contribute towards the reported incidence.The operator was operating the aircraft since November, 2008. The authorized Release Certificate FAA form 8130-3 showed that Propeller Governor Part No. 8210-410 Serial No. 2490719 was overhauled and recalibrated in accordance with Woodward Manual 61-20-35 Rev (10/98) and Woodward SB 33531 was complied with. The Overhaul was performed by International Governor Services, Broomfield, USA on 14th July, 2008.The Woodward finding that Propeller Governor Serial No. 2490719 was serviced by a facility other than Woodward and its several operating parameters were found away from the Woodward specifications indicated that the last servicing of the governor was improper but had no contribution towards the reported event of auto feathering.The investigation therefore concluded that some internal malfunction of the Governor of No. 2 engine propeller may have caused uncommanded auto feather. However, exact cause of the occurrence could not be determined.
A United Boeing 737-800, registration N76516 performing flight UA-621 from San Diego,CA to San Francisco,CA (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from runway 27 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed following the failure of the left hand engine (CFM56).

A Wizz Air Airbus A321-200, registration HA-LXD performing flight W6-3211 from Bucharest Otopeni (Romania) to Billund (Denmark), was accelerating for takeoff from Otopeni's runway 08L when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 45 knots over ground) due to a right hand engine (V2533) anomaly. The aircraft slowed safely, vacated the runway and stopped on the adjacent taxiway where emergency services inspected the aircraft.The runway was closed for about 15 minutes as result.Passengers reported the right hand engine emitted sparks.On Sep 19th 2017 the airline reported: "The incident occurred due to a misalignment of engine power. The right engine started to spool up from a lower idle speed, therefore the left engine reached the takeoff thrust while the right one was still speeding up. This caused an asymmetric thrust which resulted in the aircraft veering to the right at low speed. The airline denies the passenger report."

The aircraft slowed and taxied to the apron. While taxiing a fire was observed from both left hand main wheels prompting the crew to stop on the taxiway and initiate an evacuation of the aircraft. One occupant received minor injuries in the evacuation. Emergency services reported the fire extinguished about 18 minutes after being alerted.The airline commended their pilots for the swift action to evacuate the aircraft stating the cause of the wheel fire is being investigated with the assistance by ATR. The crew had rejected takeoff due to a fluctuating engine oil indication, while taxiing back to the apron the wheel fire broke out. All occupants were safely evacuated with one minor injury.The Philippines Civil Aviation Authority (CAAP) reported the crew rejected takeoff due to oil pressure fluctuations of the #1 engine. While taxiing to the apron on taxiway J fire was observed from #1 and #2 main wheels. The occurrence was rated a serious incident and is being investigated.The CAAP reported in a preliminary note that the inboard left main tyre had caught fire while turning off the runway onto taxiway J, the fire spread to the outboard tyre and the landing gear fuselage fairing immediately above. In addition the left hand fuselage above the gear as well as the right hand landing gear fairing showed soot.

The aircraft veered to the right, the crew rejected takeoff at high speed and the aircraft came to a stop with all gear on soft ground off the right hand edge of the runway near the end of the runway about 1700 meters down the runway. The aircraft was evacuated. There were no injuries.Honduras' Agencia Hondurena De Aeronautica Civil (AHAC) have opened an investigation into the incident.Passengers reported the right hand engine caught fire.On Aug 22nd 2017 Honduras' AHAC released their final report in Spanish concluding the probable cause of the serious incident was:the vibrations and the configuration warning that the crew felt and saw was caused by the burst of tyre #1 of the left main gear, that was observed worn, and the brake which was found outside limits and in a condition not acceptable for use (flush) as required by the aircraft maintenance manual [cause].The configuration warning was caused by the vibration of the aircraft before V1 [cause].The maneouver by the crew to turn the aircraft by 180 degrees caused the aircraft to depart the runway [contributing factor].The AHAS reported that the crew had determined V1 at 122 KIAS, Vr at 127 KIAS and V2 at 128 KIAS. The captain (43, ATPL, no hours provided) was pilot monitoring, the first officer (39, CPL, 5,523 hours total, no hours on type provided) was pilot flying. The aircraft was cleared for takeoff from runway 02. While accelerating through 110 KIAS the crew felt a vibration of the airframe and received a CONFIG warning. The captain assumed control of the aircraft and rejected takeoff using brakes and maximum reverse, however, sensing very poor deceleration insufficient to stop the aircraft before the end of the runway decided to attempt to turn the aircraft around by 180 degrees (ground loop the aircraft), the aircraft went off the right side of the runway as result. After the aircraft came to a stop the engines were shut down. There were no injuries.The aircraft sustained damage to the left main tyres (with #1 burst) and damage to the right hand propeller.Right hand propeller damage (Photo: AHAC):Ground tracks left by the aircraft: Mud covering the fuselage:TG-BJO being towed to the apron (Photo: Policia Honduras):TG-BJO being recovered (Photos: Radio America Honduras):All propeller blades still attached to right hand propeller (Photo: eljampedrano):Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):

A Eurowings Airbus A319-100, registration D-ABGO performing flight EW-2924 from Stuttgart (Germany) to Antalya (Turkey), was accelerating for takeoff from Stuttgart's runway 07 when the left hand engine ingested a bird and failed, the right hand engine failed almost at the same time. The crew rejected takeoff at high speed, turned off the runway about 1,900 meters/6,230 feet down the runway and stopped clear of the runway.The Aviation Herald received information stating, that the left hand engine ingested a bird causing severe damage to all fanblades. Fragments of the fan blades accelerated forward impacting the engine inlet as well as the slats/flaps and forward fuselage. Fragments also flew over to the right hand side and were ingested by the right hand engine resulting in fan blade damage of the right hand engine, too. The left engine inlet received several punctures, the fan case, slats/flaps and forward fuselage several dents.Germany's BFU receiving this description of the occurrence as outlined above reported, they have been informed about this occurrence and are currently collecting further information to determine the classification of the occurrence.In the following days the aircraft was seen in a maintenance hangar with the left hand engine off the pylon for being replaced and the right hand engine wide open being worked upon.On Aug 18th 2017 the BFU added, that there was a single sided bird strike resulting in an instant power loss, however, not a failure of the engine. The takeoff was rejected. Subsequently minor damage was found to the fuselage and the other engine. The occurrence was not rated accident or serious incident, an investigation has not been opened.One of the engines:The aircraft seen in the maintenance hangar:

A Jazz de Havilland Dash 8-400, registration C-FSRY performing flight QK-8875 from Toronto,ON to Windsor,ON (Canada), was cleared for takeoff from Toronto's runway 33R and was accelerating for takeoff, when the crew got sight of a towed Boeing 737-700 crossing the runway shortly before becoming airborne. The 737 and tow truck cleared the runway edge just before the Dash passed. The Dash continued for a safe landing at Windsor.The Canadian TSB reported ground control cleared the tow truck, towing a Westjet Boeing 737-700, to cross runway 33R at taxiway S about 1460 meters/4800 feet down the runway before tower cleared the Dash for takeoff. The Dash began the takeoff roll when the towed aircraft was in the middle of the runway. The runway has a slight crest with the threshold area slightly lower than the center disabling the crew of the Dash to see the crossing traffic. The Runway Incursion Monitoring and Collision Avoidance System (RIMCAS) had been turned off for runway 33R shortly before the occurrence after a persistent false target produced frequent alarms.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/JZA875/history/20170703/0255Z/CYYZ/CYQG
An Air Canada Airbus A330-300, registration C-GHKR performing flight AC-83 from Tel Aviv (Israel) to Montreal,QC (Canada) with 232 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Tel Aviv's runway 26 when the crew received a F/CTL PITCH TRIM / MCDU / CG DISAGREE message and rejected takeoff at low speed (about 50-60 knots). The aircraft vacated the runway, stopped on a taxiway for preparation of another takeoff attempt and departed about 30 minutes after the rejected takeoff. The aircraft landed safely in Montreal about 30 minutes past schedule.The Canadian TSB reported that prior to departure the fuel provider notified the crew that due to the outside air temperature of 34 degrees C the planned fuel configuration for the main tank could not be met. The fuel configuration was recalculated and the exceedance was loaded into the trim tank. The takeoff configuration check was successful, however, the increased fuel burn following the application of takeoff thrust moved the Center of Gravity slightly out of limit.

A KLM Boeing 737-800, registration PH-HSD performing flight KL-1385 from Amsterdam (Netherlands) to Kiev (Ukraine), had been cleared for takeoff from runway 18L and was accelerating for takeoff.A KLM Boeing 777-200, registration PH-BQI performing flight KL-31 from Amsterdam (Netherlands) to Toronto,ON (Canada), had been instructed to line up runway 24 and wait by the outgoing tower controller.A controller change took place. Another aircraft reported ready for departure from runway 18L and was instructed to line up runway 18L and wait by the incoming tower controller.Immediately after this instruction the incoming controller cleared KL-31 for takeoff, the crew of KL-1385 immediately reported they were still departing conflicting with KL-31's jet blast, the controller immediately cancelled takeoff clearance for KL-31 and instructed them to hold position, the aircraft had not yet moved.KL-31 departed about 2 minutes later, both aircraft reached their destinations without further incidents.On Jun 28th 2017 Netherland's LVNL (ATC provider) reported that the controller immediately after issuing the takeoff clearance on runway 24 and the readback by the crew cancelled the takeoff clearance. When the departing aircraft on runway 18L went past the intersection with runway 24 the Boeing 777 was still lining up from taxiway S6 and was not yet in position. After the departing Boeing 737 had passed the runway intersection the controller issued another takeoff clearance to the Boeing 777. The crew of the Boeing 737 did not call on frequency that they were in the takeoff. The LVNL rated the occurrence in the lowest possible category.Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):
An Egypt Air Boeing 737-800, registration SU-GEF performing flight MS-757 from Cairo (Egypt) to Amsterdam (Netherlands) with 95 passengers, was accelerating for takeoff from Cairo's runway 05C when the right hand nose tyre blew. The aircraft climbed to FL240 and entered a hold, then the crew decided to return to Cairo. The aircraft entered another hold at 5000 feet to burn off fuel. The aircraft landed safely on runway 05R about 70 minutes after departure.The Aviation Herald received information that the first officer of the flight had discovered a cut in the right hand nose tyre during the walk around, maintenance determined the cut was within acceptable limits and released the aircraft to flight. During departure the tyre blew causing damage to the nose gear doors and nose wheel well. During landing the right nose wheel was worn down to the rim.
An Iberia Express Airbus A320-200, registration EC-ILQ performing flight IB-3843 from Santa Cruz de la Palma,CI to Madrid,SP (Spain), departed Santa Cruz de la Palma's runway 01 when the left hand engine (CFM56) ingested a number of birds. The aircraft continued takeoff and climbed out, the crew stopped the climb at FL110 and decided to divert to Las Palmas,CI (Spain), where the aircraft landed safely on runway 03L about 45 minutes after departure.A ground observer at Santa Cruz de la Palma became aware of the aircraft just as it became airborne and reported the engine sound of the aircraft had changed, the aircraft sounded like a turbo prop instead of a jet. The airline reported the aircraft encountered a flock of birds and diverted to Las Palmas for technical reasons. The engines are being overhauled. The passengers were rebooked onto other flights.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Las Palmas about 30 hours after landing.
An Air Europa Airbus A330-200, registration EC-LNH performing flight UX-25 (scheduled dep Oct 16th, actual dep Oct 17th) from Madrid,SP (Spain) to Santa Cruz (Bolivia) with 267 passengers and 12 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Madrid's runway 36L at 00:37L (Oct 16th 23:37Z) when the crew noticed the presence of unusual lights. The crew inquired with tower about the origin of those lights, tower reported they were aware of the lights. When the aircraft went past the lights the crew noticed a vehicle at the left edge of the runway speeding off the paved area. The aircraft became safely airborne and continued for a safe landing in Santa Cruz.Spain's CIAIAC reported on Dec 18th 2014 that an investigation was opened into the occurrence.In an interim statement released on Oct 26th 2015 the CIAIAC reported that deviations from standard procedures regarding aerodrome maintenance were identified during the course of the investigation, which contributed to the presence of a vehicle on runway 36L. The airline took immediate safety action to instruct their crews to reject takeoff, provided the aircraft was still below V1, as soon as a possible threat to the safety of the aircraft is being identified. The investigation is continuing and assessing the performance of air traffic control with respect to the detection/non-detection of the vehicle on the runway.On Jun 22nd 2017 Spain's CIAIAC released their final report in Spanish concluding the probable cause of the serious incident was:The loss of situational awareness by the driver of the vehicle of an auxiliary company resulting in the vehicle transiting the runway in service at the same time when a takeoff occurred.Contributing factors were:- the driver's attention deficit at work- the lack of adequate training and lack of promotion of safety culture at the auxiliary company- Inaction by tower after the obstacle on the runway was identified- Inconsistent reaction by the crew during the runway incursion- Lack of reassessment of the operations safety surveillance plan in due periods of time as well as lack of verification of conduct of initial training by AENA AirportsThe CIAIAC reported that flight UX-25 received takeoff clearance from runway 36L. At the same time a vehicle was on the runway about 2670 meters down the runway, and began to travel the runway in opposite direction (towards the threshold). Soon after the A330 crew noticed unusual lights and queried tower, who however did not know the origin of those lights. About 1875 meters past the runway threshold the aircraft crossed the vehicle, which had turned the lights off and was speeding off the paved surface of the runway to the left. The aircraft continued the takeoff, the vehicle left the runway without informing anyone.A reconstruction company was contracted o carry out maintenance work in several areas of the aerodrome including runway 36R. The vehicle was dispatched to take supplies to runway 36R, the operator of the company was supposed to follow the service road around runway 36L to proceed onto runway 36R. After starting at point A (see map below) the vehicle followed the service road to point B, then turned right and followed taxiway ZW4 and after entering runway 18R/36L at point C turned left to the north (runway 36L), but about 2670 meters down runway 36L at point D turned around and now headed south in opposite direction to runway 36L coming to a stop and then speeding off the runway at point E, where the aircraft passed the vehicle. Just before the vehicle reached point D and turned around to drive the runway in opposite direction the aircraft began its takeoff roll.The CIAIAC analysed that the vehicle was not carrying a transponder. When the controller issued the takeoff clearance to UX-25 he checked the ground radar. The vehicle at that time was still moving northwards and a primary target was not presented to the controller on the radar screen, probably due to filtering, attenuation or because of reflections. The controller, with the position of the control tower near the threshold runway 36L, only saw the rear lights of the vehicle more than 2000 meters away, in addition he did not expect a vehicle on the runway and thus did not consider the lights to be on the runway. However, when the crew queried the controller about the presence of unusual lights on the runway, the controller could see the headlights of the vehicle. The controller's reaction therefore could have been improved.The CIAIAC analysed that the captain is responsible for the safe operation of his aircraft. When the crew spotted unusual lights and became unsure suspecting the presence of "something" on the runway, they should have rejected takeoff. At this time the aircraft was travelling at 89 KIAS, well below V1.The vehicle was not supposed to operate on any of the maneouvering areas of the aerodrome, hence was not required to carry transponder, a rotating beacon or a radio. Runway 36R was closed and therefore was not part of the maneouvering area. The driver of the vehicle had actually not been on duty and was called in to replace a collegue, supposedly he improvised in order to achieve the work required. Training had not been included regarding the signage and beacons of the aerodrome, the beacons for runway 36R were operated in "Revision" mode while the beacons for runway 36L were operating normally, the lack of traffic on runway 36L at that time as well as uncertainty about the own position may have led the driver to enter active runway 36L instead of closed runway 36R. After he realized his mistake seeing the lights of the aircraft and sped off the runway to avoid a collision, he then drove away without telling anyone of his company or the airport, also showing lack of responsibility and lack of safety culture within his company.As an immediate safety action the airline issued an urgent recommendation to their crews: "during takeoff phase, whenever doubts arise about a possible runway incursion regardless of vehicle, other aircraft or any other element, or when the slightest suspicion arises that the runway is not clear for takeoff, takeoff below V1 should be rejected". The CIAIAC considered this safety action adequate in view of the crew performance.Path of the vehicle (Graphics: CIAIAC):

An American Airlines Boeing 737-800, registration N896NN performing flight AA-2408 from Dallas Ft. Worth,TX to Atlanta,GA (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Fort Worth's runway 35L when an Embraer 505 business jet crossed the runway downfield. The B738 flight crew continued takeoff and the flight landing safetly in Atlanta.On Jun 2nd 2017 the NTSB reported that the closest distance between the aicraft was 2800 feet when the Boeing was just at 120 KIAS. Visual meteorologic conditions prevailed, the occurrence was rated an incident and is being investigated.
A Vietnam Airlines Airbus A330-200, registration VN-A371 performing flight VN-780 from Melbourne,VI (Australia) to Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam) with 180 passengers and 13 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Melbourne's runway 27 when the right hand engine (PW4168) failed causing the crew to reject takeoff at high speed (89 knots). The aircraft slowed safely and came to a stop on the intersection between runways 16 and 27 (3000 feet/1000 meters down the runway), emergency services responded, debris from the engine was found on the runway.The airport was closed for about one hour until the aircraft was moved off the runways.Passengers reported hearing a pop sound like a tyre had blown and seeing streaks of flame out of the engine. The crew braked hard and stopped the aircraft. Ground observers reported seeing lots of smoke from the aircraft and believed an engine fire had occurred.The airport reported there had been an engine failure, debris of the engine was found on the runway. There had been no engine fire however, the smoke came off the tyres and was the result of hard braking by the crew.The airline confirmed an "engineering malfunction" before takeoff.On Dec 22nd 2014 the Australian Transportation Safety Board (ATSB) reported that the loss of power of the right hand engine was the result of blade failures on the 4th stage of the low pressure turbine. The ATSB stated: "One of those turbine blades was found to exhibit a fracture surface that appeared to be different to the remaining blades" and followed up stating that this blade was found to have fractured as result of high cycle fatigue cracking. The area of the crack initiation however could not be examined due to being obscured by rotational contact marks between blade and 4th stage nozzle guide vane clusters. Now the investigation "will focus on determining whether the turbine blade failed due to the failure of other upstream engine components or as a result of a defect within the blade itself."On Jun 1st 2017 the ATSB released their final report concluding the probable causes of the incident were:Contributing factors- The engine failure was initiated by the failure of a blade in stage four of the low-pressure turbine due to high-cycle fatigue cracking, which originated at the aerofoils leading edge.- Cascading fracture and release of stage four turbine blades resulted in perforation of the low-pressure turbine front case and damage to the airframe from debris exiting via the exhaust duct.Other findings- The flight crews handling of the rejected take-off reduced the risk of a runway excursion, preventing further damage to the aircraft and/or injury to passengers or crew.The ATSB described the damage: "The engine cowls contained liberated LPT fragments that exited the engine radially via a 38 cm perforation in the LPT front case. There was no other damage associated with the LPT case rupture. LPT debris exited the exhaust duct and damaged the right inboard and outboard flaps, flap fairings, and the No. 2 spoiler. This damage did not affect the operation of any aircraft systems."The ATSB analysed (quoted in full):IntroductionAt 89 kt during the take-off roll, the aircrafts right engine failed. The flight crew responded appropriately, successfully bringing the aircraft to a stop on the runway. Although the failure was uncontained, debris that exited via the low-pressure turbine (LPT) front case perforations was retained within the engine cowls. Debris exiting via the exhaust duct, damaged several flight control surfaces, however, this did not affect their operation.This analysis will consider the engine failure sequence and the possible origins of the fatigue cracking in the stub of turbine blade 120 in stage four of the LPT. In addition, the high-cycle fatigue (HCF) cracking identified with 19 of the engines other stage four LPT blades will be discussed.Engine failureTurbine blade 120 failed as a result of HCF crack initiation and progression from the blades leading edge, to the point where the remaining material failed in overstress. The crack origin could not be examined for material anomaly or damage due to clashing damage from a number of stage four vane clusters. However, metal smearing over the HCF crack surface indicated that the cracking preceded the clashing damage. Despite being unable to determine the factors contributing to the cracking of blade 120, the extent of the cracking indicated that it was most likely the first blade to be released in the failure sequence.The ATSB and Pratt and Whitney were not able to conclusively determine why the vane clusters contacted the fourth stage LPT blades. The case tear resulting from the failure of blade 120 was in the same location as the vane clusters that were identified as being loose and disengaged. It is possible that distortion and damage to the structure retaining the stage four vane clusters resulted in their contact with the rotating blades of the stage four LPT rotor. However, it is also possible that the vane clusters were displaced by an unidentified mechanism resulting in contact with the stage four blades and the initiation of HCF fatigue cracking in blade 120. In this scenario, further aft movement followed, resulting in the metal smearing observed on the fracture surface of blade 120.In addition to blade 120, HCF cracking was found in 19 other stage four LPT blades. These blades exhibited minor cracking when compared to blade 120 but also exhibited similar clashing damage as sustained by blade 120. Less oxidisation on blade 18, compared to blade 120, indicated that the blade 18 fracture surface was exposed to the gas stream for less time than blade 120. Further, the HCF fracture surface on blade 18 was less advanced at the same distance from the blades leading edge compared to blade 120. This supports the cracking in blade 18 occurring later in the engine failure sequence than the cracking in blade 120, probably after the clashing commenced. It was therefore considered that the most likely initiator of the minor fatigue cracking in the 19 other blades resulted from their contact with the fourth stage vanes.The ATSB did not identify any other similar failures that would indicate a systemic issue with the Pratt and Whitney PW4168A engines. No anomalies with the previous maintenance and repair of the LPT module or blade 120 were identified.Crew actionsRecorded aircraft data indicated that the flight crews preparation of the aircraft for take-off was appropriate. During the rejected take-off, the flight crew responded effectively and communicated with the control tower and attending emergency services.The low pressure turbine case (Photo: ATSB):Engine outlet and turbine blades (Photo: ATSB):The fractured blade (Photo: ATSB):
An Air Nelson de Havilland Dash 8-300 on behalf of Air New Zealand, registration ZK-NED performing flight NZ-8275 from Kerikeri to Auckland (New Zealand), was accelerating for takeoff from Kerikeri when the crew rejected takeoff and brought the aircraft to a stop. The aircraft subsequently returned to the apron for checks.A passenger reported the captain announced a hare (rabbit) had crossed the runway prompting them to reject takeoff. As a precaution the aircraft would be checked. In the meantime airport staff was seen zigzagging the runway, however, the rabbit wasn't found.Following checks the aircraft taxied out again and was again accelerating for takeoff when the crew rejected takeoff again. The passenger reported this time the captain announced they had seen two rabbits.The aircraft now lined up for takeoff in opposite direction and succeeded takeoff delivering the passengers to Auckland with a delay of 35 minutes.The airline reported the captain returned the aircraft to the apron after suspecting they might have hit a hare on the runway. The inspection revealed there had been no hit and the aircraft departed.
An Egypt Air Airbus A330-200, registration SU-GCI performing flight MS-955 (scheduled dep May 14th, actual dep May 15th) from Cairo (Egypt) to Beijing (China) with 211 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Cairo's runway 05C when the crew rejected takeoff at about 60 knots over ground due to the failure of the left hand engine (Trent 772). The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway about 1200 meters/4000 feet down the runway and stopped clear of the runway. Following checks by emergency services the aircraft returned to the apron, passengers disembarked normally.The engine failure had caused a large hole in the cowl at the engine inlet up to fan section of the left hand engine.A replacement Airbus A330-200 registration SU-GCG reached Beijing with a delay of about 3 hours.On May 25th 2017 Egypt's AIB reported the aircraft suffered an uncontained engine failure followed by a rejected takeoff. The occurrence was rated a serious incident and is being investigated.The engine seen after the occurrence:
A Spicejet Boeing 737-800, registration VT-SGK performing flight SG-622 from Surat to Delhi (India) with 151 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Surat Gujarat's runway 04 in darkness at 19:06L (13:36Z) when three stray buffalos entered the runway. One of the buffalos was hit by the aircraft's left hand engine (CFM56), the crew rejected takeoff at about 80 knots after the collision and brought the aircraft to a safe stop about abeam the airport terminal, half way down the runway. The passengers disembarked onto the runway via stairs and were taken to the terminal. No injuries occured to humans, the buffalo was killed, the aircraft sustained substantial damage to left hand engine and left hand fuselage including damage to a static port and punctures to the fuselage skin.A replacement Boeing 737-800 registration VT-SPK positioned to Surat and reached Delhi with a delay of 4.5 hours.The airline confirmed their aircraft collided with a buffalo that had entered the aerodrome through a hole in the airport fence. The buffalo was invisible against the dark background. The airline suspended operations to Surat Gujarat as result of the accident.India's Ministry of Civil Aviation have ordered an investigation into the occurrence and a review of all airports in India to ensure that such an occurrence does not re-occur. The Airport Authority of India have received order to dispatch review teams to all airports within a month to check the safety of aerodromes and take remedial action to any such safety concern within three months.On May 24th 2017 India's DGCA released their final report concluding the probable causes of the accident were:The accident was caused as the aircraft during its initial take-off roll hit an animal (buffalo) standing on the runway, resulting in damage to its engine.The animal entered the operational area and the runway because of several breaches in the boundary wall.The DGCA reported that the aircraft backtracked runway 04 for departure, turned around to line up for departure and was departing runway 04 about one meter to the left of the runway center line in darkness when about 350 meters into the takeoff roll the left hand engine collided with a buffalo prompting the crew to immediately reject takeoff, present speed 78 KIAS. The aircraft slowed safely, in the absence of abnormal parameters the crew requested to return to the apron. A visual inspection at the apron revealed substantial damage to the engine cowl and holes at the side of the engine. The passengers were disembarked.The DGCA reported: "Fire Station in the mean time called up ATC to confirm whether there is any problem with Spicejet aircraft and asked for permission to enter runway. ATC instructed fire personnel not to enter runway. It was also informed that all operations are normal and it was an animal hit. CNS operational jeep requested ATC to cross runway for which the ATC granted the permission. CNS Jeep reported to ATC Tower that there are two Buffalos on runway one is dead and other is roaming on the runway. The runway was immediately closed for operations. After removal of the dead buffalo and inspection of runway it was declared operational."With respect to ATC procedures the DGCA analysed:As per the records available with Surat Aerodrome the procedures laid down in the AAI Ops Circular 05 of 2011 and Operational Manual of Surat were not being carried out in timely manner. As per the conversation between tower and fire staff on walkie  talkie just before the departure at 1310 they had withdrawn two bird chasers posted near Glide path and in between taxiway A & B. There was no inspection carried out as per departure procedure before the aircraft was cleared for take-off. Only inspection which was carried out was at watch opening time at 0530 hrs UTC.It is therefore inferred that Non-adherence to the standard procedures is a contributory factor to the accident.With respect to the Aerodrome the DGCA analysed that the airport had been properly inspected and licensed in 2011, no breaches of the perimeter had existed at that time. An inspection for renewal of the license was carried out in 2013 and the license was renewed. After the accident a number of breaches of the aerodrome perimeter were found. The DGCA wrote:There were several breaches found during the aerodrome inspection postaccident which further reveals that the laid down procedures were not followed. Hence Non-adherence to the above mentioned standard procedures is a contributory factor to the accident.With respect to whether the buffalos were already on the runway when the aircraft comenced takeoff or entered the runway while the aircraft was already accelerating the DGCA analysed:It is amply clear that the aircraft hit a buffalo during take-off roll at around 78 knots. This is also clear that the animals entered and were entering the airport through the breaches in the boundary wall or because of absence of secured boundary wall. The relevant question remains or comes to mind is that, Was the buffalo already on the runway or it came on the runway after the aircraft started take off roll.Whatever photographs were made available to the Committee indicate that the location of the aircraft where it had hit the animal lied on the inner side of the engine i.e. towards the fuselage roughly between 7 & 8 O clock position. Further the photographs also indicate that this was the only impact damage and had transmitted longitudinally (to the aircraft axis).The photographs of the aircraft vis a vis the animal hit by the aircraft and the damage to the engine and its location indicates that the animal was on the runway at the time of initiation of take-off roll. The CVR and ATC transcripts indicate that the take-off roll was probably initiated in continuation to the lining up on the runway.Light is absorbed in the pigments of the retinal neural receptors of the eye i.e. rods and cones. If the ambient light is below cone threshold light intensity, a blind spot 5 to 10 degrees wide develops in the center of the visual field and an object viewed directly at night may not be detected because of this night blind spot. Since rods are much more sensitive to light than cones, objects can be detected by an eccentrically fixation, i.e. looking at the objects under an angle of 17-20 degrees to one side, above or below. This might have resulted in nonspotting of the animal during take-off roll.Damage to left hand engine cowl:Damage to left hand engine:
A Vueling Airbus A320-200, registration EC-LRE performing flight VY-3912 from Barcelona,SP to Palma Mallorca,SP (Spain), had lined up runway 25L and was waiting for takeoff clearance when the brakes locked disabling the aircraft in position. The crew needed to shut the aircraft down, maintenance subsequently managed to unlock the brakes and the aircraft was towed to the apron.The runway was closed for about 45 minutes causing delays to other flights due to the unavailability of the runway.A replacement Airbus A320-200 registration EC-HQL reached Palma Mallorca with a delay of about 4 hours.
A British Airways Airbus A321-200, registration G-EUXK performing positioning flight BA-9272 from Basel/Mulhouse (Switzerland/France) to London Heathrow,EN (UK), was rotating for takeoff from Basel's runway 15 when the right hand engine (V2533) began to emit a series of bangs as result of compressor stalls prompting the crew to stop the climb at 5500 feet, shut the engine down and return to Basel for a safe landing on runway 15 about 13 minutes after departure.The aircraft had been scheduled to perform flight BA-751 earlier but had needed to return to the gate while taxiing out for departure due to a technical problem.
A Malaysia Airlines Boeing 737-800, registration 9M-MXV performing flight MH-127 from Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) to Perth,WA (Australia), was accelerating for takeoff from Kuala Lumpur's runway 14R when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 110 knots over ground) suspecting a tyre had burst. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The airline reported the captain decided to discontinue takeoff in the interest of passenger safety suspecting a tyre had burst. The passengers were taken to hotels, the flight was postponed to the following day.
A United Boeing 737-900, registration N69819 performing flight UA-72 from Honolulu,HI to San Francisco,CA (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from runway 08R when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 50 knots over ground) due to a door indication. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The aircraft was able to depart about 2.5 hours later and reached San Francisco with a delay of 2:20 hours.A passenger reported the crew advised they had received a warning light regarding the main passenger door. They now needed to check the door and the brakes. 
A JetKonnect Avions de Transport Regional ATR-72-212A on behalf of Jet Airways, registration VT-JCZ performing flight S2-2654/9W-2654 from Delhi to Bhopal (India) with 67 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Delhi's runway 29 when fire was observed from the left hand engine (PW127) prompting the crew to reject takeoff at high speed (about 110 KIAS). The aircraft slowed safely.The airline reported the crew performed a precautionary rejected takeoff due to a right hand engine fire warning, all passengers deplaned safely and were taken back to the terminal.On Aug 26th 2014 the French BEA reported in their weekly bulletin quoting the India's Accident Investigation Board (IAIB), that fire was observed from the #1 engine during takeoff, takeoff was rejected at 110 knots. There were no injuries. The IAIB rated the occurrence an incident and is investigating the occurrence.On May 18th 2017 India's DGCA released their final report concluding the probable cause of the serious incident was:The fire warning during takeoff roll was because of fire to the fuelwhich leaked from fuel nozzles due to loose B-nuts of fuel nozzles.The DGCA reported that the night before the occurrence a fuel nozzle on the left hand engine was replaced on schedule. Following the replacement a wet motoring was carried out with no fuel leaks observed. Idle power runs were conducted, slight wettings at the #6 fuel nozzle was observed, the nozzle was torqued, another ground run showed no leak. The aircraft was released to service, the next scheduled flight, the occurrence flight, was to depart about one hour later.Soon after the takeoff roll commenced and below V1 the crew received a left engine fire warning, the fire alarm activated. The captain immediately took control of the aircraft and rejected takeoff. The related checklist was worked, fire agent was discharged into the engine, ATC was notified with a Mayday Call and cabin crew was notified. The fire warning extinguished after the second fire bottle was discharged. The aircraft was shut down and towed to the apron.There were no injuries, the damage was limited to the #1 engine including heat damage.The DGCA reported the engine examination:On-wing preliminary external examination of the involved engine was carried out and leakage was observed at the #1 fuel nozzle position. To duplicate on-wing initial findings, #1 nozzle fuel manifold nut was un-torque to align marker ink marks as marked out on wing. Nitrogen leak check was then carried out observed #1 nozzle with sign of leaking. Torque check was performed on all fuel nozzles B-Nuts -- observed #2, 4 and 5 to be under torqued with #2 nozzle observed to be loose on the secondary fuel manifold.All fuel nozzles B-Nuts were re-torqued to 260 lb.in and another nitrogen leak check was performed. During second nitrogen leak check leak from #2 and #4 nozzles B-Nut was observed.As per the P&W report, the fire occurred on the engine external only. The cause of fire may be attributed to under-torque of fuel nozzles on the right hand side of the engine.- Evidence of heat damage and fire was observed on the right hand (RH) rearward of the engine after the fuel nozzles.- Soot deposit observed aft of the fuel nozzles, from the #1 fuel nozzle position to the #7 fuel nozzle position. Fuel flow Divider observed to be intact.- #1 to #4 fuel nozzles and manifold observed with soot deposit.- #1 fuel nozzle observed with nil sign of leak in as-received condition.- #1 fuel nozzle observed with sign of leakage after marker ink (marked out on- wing) was aligned.- Torque check carried out on all primary and secondary fuel manifolds observed undertorque on secondary manifold at #4 and #5 position.- #2 nozzle manifold connection observed to be loose.- Post re-torque of fuel nozzle manifold nuts to 260 lb.in observed signs of leakage at #2 and # 3 position on the secondary fuel manifold interface.- #4 fuel nozzle position observed conical seal on secondary manifold with signs of deformation on the conical surface as well as on the legs.- #5 fuel nozzle position observed conical seal on secondary manifold with signs of scoring.- #1 to 5 fuel nozzles were inspected for signs of anti-seize observed threads to be dry and shiny.- #1 to 5 fuel nozzles were installed with new conical seals on the secondary manifold and nitrogen leak check carried out observed zero sign of leakage.- #13 and #14 fuel nozzle manifolds disconnected at the secondary side observed threads to be dry with grey deposit indicate possible use of anti-seize at last installation.The DGCA analysed:On investigation, it was found that fuel nozzles #2, 4 and 5 were under torqued.The DGCA analysed the airline took following safety actions:The airline in order to avoid the recurrence of such incidents in the future has issued instructions in the form of circular which emphasis on the safety steps to be ensured while carrying out replacement of nozzle. In this quality circular i.e. ATR Fuel Nozzle Installation- Leak Checks and Best Practices it is highlighted that Fuel Nozzle change is a critical task and should be carried with due attentiveness to all the steps given in the latest task card. Salient steps emphasized are- Before engine wet motoring check, perform Nitrogen leak test to detect leaks from B-Nuts of fuel nozzles, flow Divider, Dump Valve and fuel manifold. Failure to do so may result in leaks going unnoticed.- Use leak check fluid to aid in the detection of leaks from the connections.- Perform engine ground run at 80% torque, minimum for 2 minutes.- It is mandatory to carry out duplicate inspection for the following+ Final torque of the B-nuts of the flexible manifold with the fuel nozzle adaptor connections.+ Nitrogen Leak test.In addition the occurrence and the preventive actions have also been put on the e-learning portal of the operator for the information and learning of the concerned personnel.Fuel Nozzle #2 (Photo: DGCA):Fuel Nozzle #3 (Photo: DGCA):
A Helvetic Airways Fokker 100 on behalf of Swiss, registration HB-JVH performing flight LX-724 from Zurich (Switzerland) to Amsterdam (Netherlands), was accelerating for takeoff from runway 32 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 100 knots over ground) reporting indication problems due to disagreeing airspeeds. The aircraft slowed safely, backtracked the runway to vacate the runway and returned to the apron.A passenger reported the crew reported one the air speed indicator at the first officer's side showed no airspeed.A replacement A320-200 registration HB-JLP reached Amsterdam with a delay of 2 hours.The occurrence aircraft rejected another takeoff about 11.5 hours later, see Incident: Helvetic F100 at Zurich on May 14th 2017, rejected takeoff due to disagreeing airspeed, and returned to service the following day about 24 hours after the first rejected takeoff.
A Jet2.com Boeing 757-200, registration G-LSAB performing flight LS-271 from Leeds,EN (UK) to Alicante,SP (Spain), was accelerating for takeoff from Leeds' runway 14 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 40 knots over ground) reporting an engine (RB211) fire indication, slowed safely, shut the engine down and discharged a fire bottle. Emergency services checked the aircraft with no findings and followed the aircraft to the apron.The airline reported the crew received a technical fault indication.A replacement Boeing 737-300 registration G-GDFM reached Alicante with a delay of 2.5 hours.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground 14 hours after the rejected takeoff.
An Allegiant Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-83, registration N407NV performing flight G4-436 from Las Vegas,NV to Peoria,IL (USA), was preparing for departure with a delay of almost 4 hours. The aircraft was accelerating for takeoff from runway 25R, when the nose wheel lifted off prematurely and without pilot input at about 120 KIAS. At that time tower cleared the next departure to maintain visual separation to the departing Allegiant MD83 and for takeoff from runway 25R, a few seconds later tower cancelled that takeoff clearance when the crew of the Allegiant MD-83 rejected takeoff at high speed, the nose gear touched down again and the aircraft slowed safely. The crew indicated that no assistance was needed and taxied to the apron.The FAA reported: "The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating an incident that occurred on Aug. 17 when a McDonnell Douglas MD-83 operated Allegiant Airlines experienced a flight control problem while taking off from Las Vegas McCarran International Airport. The crew reported that the nose wheel lifted off of the runway prematurely during the takeoff roll. The captain discontinued the takeoff and returned safely to the gate. The airline reported the incident to the FAA. A preliminary investigation found that a nut on a component that moves the left elevator had fallen off, causing the control surface to become jammed in the up position."The airline reported the left elevator boost actuator of N407NV had become disconnected. A fleet wide examination of MD-80 aircraft was conducted with no further anomaly found.The NTSB told The Aviation Herald they are investigating the occurrence, subsequently amending the note to: "Or, more accurately, we are in contact with the company about the incident."The rotation G4-436/G4-437 was cancelled.The occurrence aircraft resumed service about 62 hours after the rejected takeoff.On May 12th 2017 the FAA accidentally sent their unredacted investigation report to the Tampa Bay Times, however, without any photos mentioned in the file. The report states, that the maintenance service provider to Allegiant, AAR Aircraft Services Incorporated, had performed maintenance on the aircraft on May 23rd 2015 by installing an overhauled left elevator boost control cylinder Serial Number SRT001. Following the incident the FAA inspector verified, that the unit then installed on the aircraft and following the incident removed from the aircraft was the same that had been installed on May 23rd 2015. As part of that maintenance task it was also necessary to perform a weight and balance on the left hand elevator, "which required that the left elevator (and tabs) be removed and reinstalled, which was found to also affect the rod end for the elevator power control boost cylinder, as the castellated nut must be removed from the elevator power control boost cylinder rod end in order to remove the elevator."The inspector further established: "The mechanic confirmed that the access panel that gives access to the elevator boost cylinder rod end nut is normally a sealed panel and was sealed prior to him opening it for access to the rod end. If a cotter pin had fallen out of the castellated nut due to being improperly installed it would have been retained in the immediate enclosed area. A castellated nut and washer that fell off the rod end were located but a cotter pin in that area was not found, this indicates a cotter pin had not been installed."The investigation found: "when the nut and washer fell off, the rod end came out of the orifice, and the elevator rod end wedged on the structure. Pictures provided show evidence that the rod end had been loose withinthe rod end orifice, as was determined by the wear on the threads."The investigation concluded that the elevator boost cylinder rod end nut had been incorrectly installed without being recorded as being incomplete and returned the aircraft to service contrary to requirements. This further led to non-inspection of these portions of the left elevator, that were required inspection items. This omission of inspection was identified as a causal factor into the serious incident.The FAA analysed that the failure to document and perform maintenance steps violated both FAA regulations as well as AAR's own quality control manual.The FAA described the legal fall out of the investigation: "Aircraft N407NV flew a total of 261 revenue flights (See IOP #26) before the nut backed off of the elevator power control boost cylinder rod end and caused the loss of pitch control that resulted in the aborted takeoff on August 17, 2015. Had the nut fallen off while the aircraft was actually flying, or had the crew not aborted the takeoff, the maintenance and inspection complacent actions performed by AAR Aircraft Services personnel would have resulted in an aircraft flying without the ability to control its pitch attitude, as evidenced by the aborted takeoff flight control response experienced by the crew on N407NV. Deliberate acts of noncompliance by company personnel resulted in improper maintenance that endangered numerous lives and properties during 261 subsequent flights following its return to service by AAR Aircraft Services, Inc., caused an unacceptable safety risk to safety and caused the airline to be in violation of 14 CFR. Part 121.369(b)(1)." Following the receipt of a response by AAR stating that the maintenance steps had been completed including the last steps 28 and 29, the FAA thundered: "This confirms that they are even now, still not familiar or do not intend follow the Allegiant Air GMM procedures for documenting Forms M301 and M302 specifically requires maintenance personnel to enter partial work to be entered in the Partial Work Accomplished sections of the form as indicated in GMM Page 21.2.19.1Section B items 4 and 5 (See IOP 21B), which the repair station is required to follow. Additionally, in the response from AAR Aircraft Services, Inc., on page 3 paragraph 2, they state and admit that they have had the same quality escape two other times. This shows these quality lapses are likely systemic, and yet the repair station shows angst over not being allowed to self-disclose a recurring concern."The FAA continued to thunder: "There are deliberate and systemic acts of noncompliance with the airline procedures, repair station procedures and Federal Aviation Regulations by personnel at the AAR Aircraft Services, Inc., which indicates lack of management oversight. It is evident that the corrective actions plans to previous noncompliance events by the repair station overlook the complacency of management, complacency of Quality Assurance and acts of deliberate omissions by the maintenance technicians and the inspection department that are written off as human factor issues, instead of identifying them as deliberate actions of noncompliance with Federal Aviation Regulations, the Repair Station Quality Control Manual procedures and the airlines GMM procedures that company personnel must comply with for safety of the flying public. This shows lack of management oversight or training by AAR Aircraft Services and is shown to be an unacceptable risk."The FAA concluded: "This violation was deliberate. While there was no mal intent by the company personnel it is evident that several deliberate and cognizant actions can be identified that were made by the maintenance technicians and the inspection personnel at AAR Aircraft Services, Inc., and includes a strong likelihood of lack of managerial oversight as is discussed below." The FAA investigator thus made following recommendation: "I recommend maximum sanction be imposed for each FAR violation identified, in addition I recommend that a sanction be added for each of the 216 flights that were flown in violation as AAR Aircraft Services, Inc , was causal to the flights flown in an unairworthy condition."
A United Boeing 777-200, registration N774UA performing flight UA-1858 from San Francisco,CA to Denver,CO (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from San Francisco's runway 01R when the crew rejected takeoff at about 80 KIAS when the first officer's airspeed did not agree with the other airspeed indicators. The aircraft slowed safely, vacated the runway and returned to the apron.A replacement Boeing 777-200 registration N773UA reached Denver with a delay of 9:40 hours.
A LATAM Brasil Airbus A320-200, registration PR-MHG performing flight JJ-3392 from Sao Paulo Congonhas,SP to Brasilia,DF (Brazil), departed Congonhas' runway 17R but suffered an engine failure leaving debris on the runway. The crew continued takeoff, climbed to about 7000 feet and diverted to Sao Paulo's Guarulhos Airport for a safe landing on runway 09R about 20 minutes after departure.The runway at Congonhas Airport remained closed for about 150 minutes.The airline reported the aircraft collided with a bird and diverted to Guarulhos.A replacement A320-200 registration PR-MYT reached Brasilia with a delay of 2.5 hours.A source told The Aviation Herald that no bird strike had occurred, there was no visible damage to fan blades (front of engine) or turbine section (aft outlet section of engine). However, a bleed air tube at the 14th stage compressor had fractured causing damage to the engine and prompting the engine electronic control to automatically shut the engine down.Engine damage:
A Japan TransOcean Boeing 737-400, registration JA8938 performing flight NU-610 from Ishigaki to Okinawa (Japan) with 44 people on board, was on final approach to Okinawa's runway 18 at about 13:20L (04:20Z), another aircraft was in the takeoff roll (see: Incident: ANA B738 at Okinawa on Jun 3rd 2015, rejected takeoff on ATC instruction due to runway incursion, when tower instructed the departing aircraft to stop and instructed NU-610 to go around. The crew continued the landing and touched down on the runway still occupied by the departing B738 having stopped on the runway about 1650 meters down the runway short of the first high speed turn off. The B734 rolled out without incident, reached taxi speed about 400 meters short of the B738 and vacated the runway via taxiway E4 (90 degrees intersection) about 1600 meters down the runway.Japan's Transportation Safety Board rated both occurrences, the runway incursion forcing the rejected takeoff as well as the continuation of landing despite instruction to go around, as serious incidents each and dispatched three investigators on site.Japan's Ministry of Transport reported the captain was aware of the other aircraft on the runway but thought it would pose no problem for landing.On Apr 27th 2017 Japans's TSB (JTSB) released their final report concluding the probable causes of the two serious incidents were:It is certain that this serious incident occurred as follows: when the Aircraft B rejected a takeoff on the runway 18 due to the Aircraft A crossed over in its front, and the Aircraft C landed on the runway 18 before its vacating.It is probable that the Aircraft C landed on the runway was because the PIC, recognizing the existence of the Aircraft B on the runway when the FO started flare, as it had been issued the landing clearance by the aerodrome control tower, although he could not confirm the trend of the Aircraft B, based on his experience at the airport and on the same type of aircraft and the landing performance, it was judged by the PIC that it could land safely. It is also somewhat likely that the judgment is related to the fact the PIC could not confirm the trend of the Aircraft A which had crossed over the runway.Regarding the Aircraft C landed on the runway although the aerodrome control tower of the aerodrome control facility instructed it to execute a go-around, it is probable that it had already landed on the runway and the reverse thrust operation was started when the PIC and the FO were recognizing the instruction. In addition, it is probable that it was involved that the instruction of executing a go-around had missed the timing.It is highly probable that the reason why the Aircraft B rejected take-off is that, while the PIC was in the situation that he was not able to determine the flight direction of the Aircraft A approaching its departure course after the take-off of the Aircraft A and because the PIC of the Aircraft B felt a serious danger in the continued take-off; therefore, he decided to reject the take-off. Besides, it is highly probable that, regarding the take-off of the Aircraft A, its pilots misunderstood the take-off clearance for the Aircraft B as the clearance for their aircraft, as well as the Pilot and the Load-master carried out external visual checks; however, it was due to delay in noticing the Aircraft B that commenced a take-off roll.Moreover, regarding the fact that the pilots of the Aircraft A misunderstood the take-off clearance for the Aircraft B as their take-off clearance, although they could not accurately hear what was transmitted to them by the Tower, it is probable that they did not make confirmation of the contents of the transmission. Besides, it is probable that the pilots of the Aircraft A did not notice misunderstanding the take-off clearance, as there was nothing pointed out from the Tower to the wrong read-back of the Aircraft A.It is probable that because the Aircraft A was not pointed out from the Tower to the wrong read-back, as the Tower was not able to hear its read-back. About this matter, it is probable that because the characteristics of the VHF receiver used for air traffic control communication was involved.The JTSB labelled the helicopter as aircraft A, the ANA Boeing 737-800 Aircraft B, that rejected takeoff, and the landing TransOcean Boeing 737-400 Aircraft C.The JTSB analysed that weather had no role into both serious incidents.The JTSB analysed that the principles of how VHF transmitters/receivers work, in particular overlapping readbacks by both Aircraft A (helicopter) and Aircraft B (B734) both acknowledging the previous takeoff clearance to the B734, the brief readback by the helicopter crew could not be heard by tower, who thus remained unaware that the helicopter had incorrectly assumed the takeoff clearance for them and thus no correction of the false readback occurred. The JTSB wrote: "It is somewhat likely that in the current state of the VHF radio telephone receiver of the present ATC facilities, when two or more aircraft simultaneously transmit signals to the ATC facilities at the same frequency, the weaker signal transmission form an aircraft is suppressed when received by the receiver of the ATC facilities and there is a possibility that a phenomenon that the control agency cannot perceive the received signal perceive at all in the future. When aircraft transmit on the same frequency at the same time, it is desirable that CAB inform the persons involved ATC communications that the air traffic controllers might be unable to recognize the situation."The JTSB analysed that the helicopter pilot, seated in the right hand seat of his helicopter, departing in takeoff direction to the right of the runway could not see the landing and departing traffic on the runway. The pilot instructed his loadmaster to look out for landing and departing traffic on the runway, however, it was likely the loadmaster looked at the approach path mainly and therefore did not report the aircraft on the departure roll timely.The JTSB analysed that the copilot of the helicopter doing radio communications was puzzled by being instructed to stand by when requesting takeoff clearance but being given hovering clearance shortly followed by an "IMMEDIATE TAKEOFF" clearance. The co-pilot did not fully understand the callsigns though but knowing the congestion of the aerodrome assumed they were cleared for immediate takeoff. The JTSB wrote: "In the case where the Pilot could not hear contents of ATC communication even partly or uncertain of it, it is considered necessary to make basic correspondence to request for confirmation from the ATC facilities. In addition, as described in 2.1.2(1) and (2), it is considered to be an effective means for the ATC communication that does not occur misunderstanding to determine a procedure in order to securely understand the contents of the ATC communication. As described in 2.1.2 (2), the Co-pilot, when being instructed to stand-by with the call "STAND BY" from the Tower in response to the take-off request made by himself, read back the instruction and requested for a clearance of hovering, it was required to understand the meaning of the "STAND BY" specified in the standards for ATC Operational Procedure described in 2.14.7."The JTSB analysed that the captain of the departing ANA B738 observed the helicopter departing along taxiway A-5 but was unsure about the aircraft's trajectory. The captain also was aware of the risks involved rejecting takeoff at high speed. Being unable to determine the trajectory of the helicopter he felt a serious danger in the continued takeoff and therefore called "Reject", which the pilot monitoring, the first officer, promptly radioed to tower.The JTSB analysed that the captain of the B734 was aware of the previous departure and, when they received landing clearance, observed the B738 in the departure roll. Shortly afterwards he observed the helicopter crossing the runway, focussed on the departing Boeing and did not notice any slow down. The first officer, seeing the helicopter flying away to the west, thought the Boeing would continue takeoff, both pilots therefore concluded a go around was not necessary and continued the approach.Just when the first officer of the B734 was about to initiate flare for landing the captain realized the B738 was still on the runway, took control of the aircraft and, judging from his experience of aircraft performance on both aircraft types, concluded they could continue landing safely, they were cleared to land, they could not fully determine the flight trajectory of the helicopter and therefore continued landing.The JTSB analysed that the captain had already engaged thrust reversers when tower instructed the go-around. With the thrust reversers deployed regulations and FCOM required a full stop landing to be completed, the FCOM stated the aircraft can not fly safely after the thrust reversers were deployed.The JTSB analysed that 570 meters of separation remained between the two Boeing Aircraft. As such they rated the category of risk of collision as C (An incident characterized by time and/or distance to avoid collision).Metars:OAH 030600Z 21014KT 9999 FEW014 BKN/// 28/25 Q1009 RMK 1CU014 A2981ROAH 030530Z 20013KT 9999 FEW014 BKN/// 29/26 Q1009 RMK 1CU014 A2980ROAH 030500Z 20012KT 9999 FEW014 BKN/// 29/26 Q1009 ROAH 030500Z 20012KT 9999 FEW014 BKN/// 29/26 Q1009 RMK 1CU014 A2981ROAH 030430Z 20012KT 9999 FEW014 BKN/// 29/26 Q1009 RMK 1CU014 A2982ROAH 030400Z 20013KT 9999 FEW014 BKN/// 29/26 Q1010 ROAH 030400Z 20013KT 9999 FEW014 BKN/// 29/26 Q1010 RMK 1CU014 A2983ROAH 030330Z 20014KT 9999 FEW014 BKN/// 29/26 Q1010 ROAH 030330Z 20014KT 9999 FEW014 BKN/// 29/26 Q1010 RMK 1CU014 A2984ROAH 030300Z 20013KT 9999 FEW015 BKN/// 29/26 Q1010 ROAH 030300Z 20013KT 9999 FEW015 BKN/// 29/26 Q1010 RMK 1CU015 A2984ROAH 030230Z 20013KT 9999 FEW015 BKN/// 28/25 Q1010 RMK 1CU015 A2985ROAH 030200Z 20013KT 9999 FEW015 BKN/// 28/25 Q1010 Estimated positions of all three aircraft (Graphics: JTSB):Shot off an airport surveillance camera, NH-1694 stationary, NU-610 still in the roll out:Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):
An ANA All Nippon Airways Boeing 737-800, registration JA80AN performing flight NH-1694 from Okinawa to Sapporo (Japan) with 83 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Okinawa's runway 18 when an air defense helicopter crew, who had mistaken the takeoff clearance to NH-1694 for themselves, departed and entered the protected range of the runway prompting the tower controller to instruct the Boeing 737-800 to stop. The crew rejected takeoff at high speed and stopped on the runway about 1650 meters down the runway (short of the first high speed turn off). Tower at the same time instructed the next aircraft on short final to go around, the aircraft however continued landing touching down on the occupied runway, see Incident: Japan TransOcean B734 at Okinawa on Jun 3rd 2015, continued landing onto occupied runway despite instruction to go around.Japan's Transportation Safety Board (JTSB) rated the runway incursion as well as the continuation of landing as a serious incident each and opened an investigation dispatching three investigators on site.On Apr 27th 2017 Japan's TSB released their final report, see the coverage included in the second runway incursion at Incident: Japan TransOcean B734 at Okinawa on Jun 3rd 2015, continued landing onto occupied runway despite instruction to go around.
A SAS Scandinavian Airlines Boeing 737-700, registration LN-RPJ performing flight SK-4479 from Kirkenes to Oslo (Norway), had backtracked runway 24 and turned around to line up for takeoff when closely aligned with the runway center line the crew applied thrust for takeoff however noticed the aircraft was continuing to turn left. The crew rejected takeoff at very low speed, applied asymmetric braking leaving significant right main tyre marks on the runway and brought the aircraft to a stop within the runway edge lines.The aircraft remained in the position for about an hour before it could be towed off the runway onto an apron.A passenger reported the captain announced a nose wheel had locked up swinging the aircraft to the left.The airline reported a nose gear steering malfunction prompted the crew to reject takeoff, the aircraft came to a stop at an angle to the runway center line. The passengers disembarked onto the runway and were bussed to the terminal.Passenger photo of LN-RPJ stopped on the runway:
An Air India Airbus A321-200, registration VT-PPM performing flight AI-937 from Kozhikode (India) to Dubai (United Arab Emirates) with 191 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff when the left hand engine (CFM56) failed causing the aircraft to veer left, a left main tyre contacted a runway edge light. The crew managed to regain control and brought the aircraft to a stop on the runway.Kozhikode Airport reported the aircraft veered left of the runway centerline by about 30 meters, contacted and destroyed a runway edge light and came to a stop with a burst inboard left main tyre after the left hand engine had failed during the takeoff run. Engine debris was recovered from the runway. A replacement Airbus A321-200 registration VT-PPA is estimated to reach Dubai with a delay of about 7 hours.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Kozhikode about 9 hours after the rejected takeoff.
An Insel Air Fokker 50, registration PJ-KVM performing flight 7I-304 from Bonaire (Netherlands Antilles) to Curacao (Curacao), was accelerating for takeoff from Bonaire when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.A passenger reported the aircraft was accelerating for takeoff when about half way down the runway (length 2880 meters/9450 feet) the brakes came on hard. The crew announced they had aborted takeoff due to a computer error.The aircraft reached Curacao with a delay of about 180 minutes.
A KLM Boeing 777-200, registration PH-BQP performing flight KL-751 from Quito (Ecuador) to Guayaquil (Ecuador), was accelerating for takeoff from Quito's runway 36 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed due to an engine (GE90) problem. The aircraft came to a stop about 450 meters/1500 feet down the runway. The aircraft returned to the apron.A passenger reported there was a big bang but no visible streaks of flame from the engine. The aircraft returned to the apron, where passengers were requested to remain on board while an engine was being examined. The aircraft was able to depart about 100 minutes later.The occurrence aircraft became airborne about 2.5 hours after the rejected takeoff, reached Guayaquil with a delay of 2.5 hours and the ultimate destination Amsterdam with a delay of 2:20 hours.
VIP Terminal (Photo: Steve Rwanda) A Jetlink Air Canadair CRJ-100 on behalf of Rwandair Express, registration 5Y-JLD performing flight WB-205 from Kigali (Rwanda) to Entebbe (Uganda) with 10 passengers and 5 crew (one flight mechanics), turned around shortly after takeoff with the crew reporting a jam of their throttle levers. The airplane landed safely, but subsequently impacted the VIP terminal of Kigali Airport at around 13:00 local (11:00Z). A fire broke out.Emergency services were able to quickly contain the fire. Several injuries occured, especially with the flight crew, who were trapped in the cockpit and needed to be freed. One flight crew was freed about three hours after the accident. Emergency services at the airport report no fatalities. Injuries also occured to people in the VIP terminal. A total of 10 injured have been taken to local hospitals.Jetlink reported, that the airplane was taxiing in, when the aircraft impacted the pavillon of the VIP lounge nose-first with engines at high power. All passengers could leave the airplane on their own, the airline however believed that one female passenger passed away in hospital.Rwandair Express said in a detailed statement of Nov 13th, that the airplane had taken off at 12:40L, two minutes later the captain requested to return due to a technical problem. The airplane landed safely and taxied to the gate. When the ground crew was just about to put wheel chocks on, the airplane suddenly accelerated, turned right and hit the eastern wall of the VIP terminal building about 500 meters away. 8 passengers were brought to the hospital, one female passenger died, one passenger received two broken ribs and a punctured lung, 6 of them were released after evaluation. Both cabin crew were also delivered to hospital and discharged after evaluation. The captain received a broken leg, the first officer a broken ankle, the flight mechanics received bruises and was kept in hospital for observation.Rwanda's Information minister reported, that one passenger died in hospital, four more passengers and one crew member received injuries.Passengers reported, that the crew told them about technical problems about 15 minutes into the flight and returned to Kigali. The airplane touched down, but then it appeared the pilots were unable to slow/stop the airplane before it impacted the building.Rwanda's Air Accident Investigation Department (RAAID) released their final report concluding the probable causes of the accident were:The flight crews failure to identify corrective action and their lack of knowledge of applicable airplane and engine systems in response to a jammed thrust lever, which resulted in the number 1 engine operating at high power and the airplane configured in an unsafe condition that led to the need to apply heavy braking during landing. Also causal was the flightcrew failure to recognize the safety hazard that existed from overheated brakes and the potential consequence on the braking action needed to park the airplane. Contributing factors included the possible failure by maintenance crew to correctly stow the upper core cowl support strut after maintenance, Flightcrews failure to follow standard operating procedures, the companys failure to be availed to manufacturer safety literature on the subject, and the susceptibility of the cowl core support shaft to interfere with the throttle control mechanism when the core strut is not in its stowed position.The RAAID summarized the captain's (37, ATPL, 11,478 hours total, 1,110 hours on type) testimony: "after getting airborne, I asked my copilot to conduct the climb and after takeoff checks. She had a problem with retarding the left thrust lever. I called the engineer to help the copilot retard the left throttle, but it was not possible. I asked the tower controller for permission to land. I landed with one engine on maximum power and landed normally though heavy braking, the tires deflated and parked the aircraft and shortly the plane started rolling downwards toward the barrier and Air Traffic Control Tower building. I had no control over the plane as I even tried to steer it clear of the building."The RAAID summarized the first officer's (27, CPL, 1,558 hours total, 533 hours on type) testimony: "after takeoff, I tried to set climb thrust and noticed the left thrust lever could not adjust. I then informed the captain that the throttle was stuck. He tried to adjust it too but it was stuck. We then called for the engineer, we coordinated together and the captain focused on flying the plane safely while I communicated with ATC, did the checklists and we combined efforts with the engineer to try and adjust the left thrust lever. We landed safely and parked but the left trust lever could not be adjusted still. As we were trying to retard it and shut it down while holding on brakes, the plane started rolling again. Efforts to stop it from rolling failed but the captain managed to control it away from the other traffic. We then hit a wall as the plane could not stop and the thrust lever was still stuck forward."The RAAID reported that the #1 engine was running at 95% according to flight data recorder while the right hand engine varied between 28 and 88%. The aircraft began the descent back to Kigali at about 9200 feet MSL, setup for a circling descent and configured the aircraft for landing while the first officer and an engineer on board of the aircraft, who had come to the cockpit to assist the flight crew, continued to attempt to retard the thrust lever. The RAAID wrote: "The flightcrew made no discussion at any time about referencing the quick reference handbook, flight crew operating manual, or airplane flight manual."The aircraft landed on runway 28 with engine #1 at 95% N1 and #2 at 27% N1. Heavy braking ensued to stop the aircraft. The aircraft came to a stop at the apron before the VIP building, the #1 engine continued to run at high power while the crew discussed the engine problem and how to shut it down. The crew received a brakes overheat warning and shut the #2 engine down, however, the #1 engine was still running at high speed. About 76 seconds after the aircraft came to a stop at the apron the aircraft began to move again. At this time the captain was briefing the purser that they were unable to shut the left hand engine down and the passengers should disembark through the right hand door and galley. Only then the crew noticed the aircraft was moving again at 23 knots, the crew started screaming for chocks, the screams continued until impact with the terminal building.A ground witness reported the aircraft had been choked in parking bay #4 however started to move again. The nose of the aircraft went through the terminal and tower building, the engines continued to run.The RAAID described the damage: "The aircraft was substantially damaged. Wings detached from the front attachment points. The aircraft nose section and the cockpit area were damaged."The RAAID reported that on Nov 10th 2009 the left hand engine needed maintainance requiring to open the core cowl. The RAAID wrote: "The engineer, who last closed the core cowl before the day of the accident, was familiar with stowing and securing the cowl strut. Investigation did not positively determined if the engineer had correctly stowed the cowl strut soon after maintenance."The RAAID also mentioned another occurrence where the left hand engine had gone out of control: "On a separate occasion during ground test of the left engine after maintenance work was conducted on the fuel control Unit (FCU), a rod of the FCU came loose and the engine became uncontrollable. The engineer (mentioned above), who had not secured the rod prior to ground tests, managed to shut down the engine using fuel shut off valve."A post accident investigation revealed that the core cowl support strut was not in its stowed position blocking the fuel control unit actuating arm to retard below 93%.The RAAID wrote: "Examination of the left engine revealed the throttle mechanism was in the idle position, the upper core cowl support strut not its stowed position and the safety pin hanging from its lanyard as indicated in number 3 photo below. The strut was in a position to prevent movement of the fuel control unit actuating arm less than the 93% N1. The components of the strut stow assembly, consisting of the locking collar, spring clip, and lock pin were inspected and no evidence of mechanical malfunction was revealed. Continuity was established between the left engine thrust lever and fuel control unit."The RAAID commended the crew for landing the aircraft in the most abnormal conditions, however condemned the crew for lack of discipline working the checklists, consulting with company maintenance, lack of system knowledge and overall poor judgement. The RAAID analysed:The TLJ condition was noticed by the flightcrew early in the takeoff phase and the PIC decided to discontinue the flight to the destination, to take steps to resolve the problem and the consequential abnormal flight performance. However, flightcrew s lack of discipline to complying with standard procedures under the conditions, lack of understanding of the engine systems, failure to consult with company operational and maintenance personal, and overall poor judgment resulted in their not being able to identify the appropriate action. Consequently, the aircraft performance remained in an undesired state with the number 1 engine at an improper power setting for landing and during ground operations. The inadequate flightcrew actions resulted in an escalation of a single abnormal condition to a cascading of non-normal conditions together with an increase in workload and task saturation.Despite the flightcrew mishandling of the TLJ, they commendably were able to land the airplane under a most abnormal condition.The increased power setting on the number 1 engine during the landing required extra braking resulting in hot brakes. The flightcrew was aware of the problem, but did not fully recognize the consequences of the conditions if not remedied. As was the case in the air, the flightcrew deviated from procedures when a non-normal condition was encountered, together with the false sense that the level of threat to safety had been significantly reduced, resulted in the brake operation continuing. The application of brakes during taxi only aggravated the hot brakes of which apparently the flightcrew did not fully realize the degree of safety hazard that existed.Under normal circumstances, the captain should have reported the situation to ATC and follow airplane flight manual and airport procedures for hot brakes which would have involved firefighting personnel at the time. However, the no 1 engine power setting made avoidance of the use of the brakes impracticable. Therefore Flightcrews failure to shut down the number 1 engine and continuing inability to allow a correctable condition to persist were the sources of the succeeding hazards.Although the PIC succeeded with bringing the airplane to a stop, he understandably became focused on the evacuation of the airplane and shutting down the number 1 engine. Consequently, his lack of understanding of the brake system and the associated non-normal condition resulted in a degradation of the braking capabilities. The captains lack of comprehension of the deterioration and his concern about the number 1 engine resulted in communication with the cabin attendant that invariably resulted in instructions to the passengers to unfasten their seatbelt, placing them in a hazardous condition, which in the case was probably not foreseeable. The crew was concerned with the safety of the passengers by their quick exiting of the airplane and the decision to release the seatbelts was not unreasonable.The loss of capability of the airplane to remain parked can be attributed to either one or a combination of the following events: deflation of the tire due to rupture/ melting of the wheel fuses and the loss of adequate hydraulic pressure to provide sufficient parking braking. The rupture of the tire and the melting of the wheel fuse plug would have been a direct result of the hot brakes as the over-temperatures exceeded the limits to maintain the mechanical integrity of the components causing the loss of sufficient ground traction. The loss of hydraulic pressure as a result of the shutdown of the number 2 engine, which occurred before the airplane was parked, resulted in the loss of brake pressure to the outboard brakes. The airplane swerved to the right during its uncommanded movement before it struck the building. The action is consistent with the loss of ground traction, and the absence of skid marks, from the left inside tire, as evident by the deflated left inside tire, and the application of brakes on the right tire due the availability of only hydraulic system number 1 as exhibited by the associated skid marks.The passengers were unrestrained when the airplane abruptly traveled across the ramp from the park position. The announcement to the passengers to unfasten the seat belts would have given the passengers that it was safe to become unseated in anticipation of exiting the airplane. Therefore many of the passengers were probably standing at the outset of the sudden movement of the airplane from being parked. The passengers, especially those who were standing would have been displaced by forces associated with the acceleration and deceleration with the respective movement across the ramp and the collision with the barriers and building, and its probable the foregoing sequence attributed directly to the injuries that were sustained by the occupants in the cabin. Consistent with the surgeons forensic determination of the fatal injuries to the passenger, rescuers statements, the collapsed structure of which she was subject increased the severity of the incurred injuries.The RAAID analysed with respect to the engine cowl support strut:The aircraft had been operated for 4.6 hours, and completed 6 flight segments since it had undergone scheduled maintenance. The number 1 engine core cowl door had not been opened since the maintenance. There were no deficiencies reported involving the operation of the thrust lever for the number 1 engine. It is suspected maintenance crew did not correctly stow the cowl strut after performing maintenance and due to engine vibrations, could have moved and interfered with engine throttle mechanism. Therefore, the cowl strut interference probably occurred during the takeoff phase of the accident flight, most likely shortly before the TLJ was noticed by the flightcrew.The company operational personnel were not familiar with the service bulletin or history of in-flight incidents involving the cowl core door support shaft mechanism. The maintenance personnel, including those who were last involved with the closing the cowl door, were knowledgeable of the correct latching procedure. There was no indication that the procedure was not followed when the cowl door was last used.The support shaft stow mechanism had been the subject of several service bulletins requiring its modification. The aircraft manufacture considers the jam of one engine throttle during flight a low risk as the manufacturer has provided a mitigating procedure in both the Aircraft Flight Manual and FCOM. The service bulletins were specified as discretionary for compliance except one recommended service bulletin number 601R-71-026. Although there were indications of compliance to the earlier service bulletins, the one in effect at the time of the accident had not been complied with. Further, several incidents had occurred before this accident were attributed to the core cowl door support strut interfering with left engine throttle mechanism. Given the possible failure by maintenance crew to stow the core cowl support strut correctly and mechanism susceptibility to interfere with throttle mechanism in its unstowed position, it is most probable that the incorrectly stowed core cowl support strut interfered with the throttle mechanism above 93% NI speed during takeoff resulting in the engine number 1 throttle jam.The company lack of familiarity with the history of the cowl door support shaft stow mechanism was a combination of its maintenance program that did not require mandatory compliance of all service bulletins, not availing itself to safety literature that would have alerted of the problem, and the manufacturers classification of the service bulletin as low risk that resulted in undervaluing the level of risk associated with the condition.Metars:HRYR 121230Z 00000KT 9999 SCT030 SCT100 26/16 Q1015 NOSIG HRYR 121200Z VRB03KT 9999 BKN030 26/17 Q1016 NOSIG HRYR 121130Z VRB03KT 9999 BKN030 26/13 Q1016 NOSIGHRYR 121100Z VRB03KT 9999 BKN030 26/17 Q1017 NOSIGHRYR 121030Z VRB03KT 9999 BKN030 24/18 Q1018 NOSIG HRYR 121000Z 00000KT 9999 SCT030 SCT100 24/17 Q1018 NOSIG The cowl support strut not in its stowed position and blocking the fuel control (Photo: RAAID):5Y-JLD pentrated the terminal building (Photo: Reuters/Hereward Holland):Map (Courtesy Google Earth):
A Tassili Travail Aerien Let L-420, registration ZS-OUE performing a charter flight from Hassi Messaoud to Bir Seba (Algeria) with 10 passengers and 2 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from runway 36 at about 07:45L (06:45Z) when the crew needed to reject takeoff. The aircraft came to a stop on the runway about 1520 meters/5000 feet down the runway with the nose gear collapsed and was disabled. The airport had to be closed.Tassili Airlines (parent company of Tassili Travail Aerien) reported the aircraft took off and went immediately back down due to the crew realizing one of the wheels had come off. There were no injuries. The aircraft was later lifted, the nose gear was re-extended and the aircraft was towed to a hangar.Ground observers reported the aircraft was accelerating when the nose gear gave way prompting the crew to reject takeoff, the aircraft skidded to a stop on its nose.Bir Seba is a private airfield, operated by an oil company, about 60nm northnortheast of Hassi Messaoud.Metars:DAUH 190900Z 06006KT 6000 NSC 30/01 Q1011=DAUH 190830Z 06007KT 6000 NSC 28/04 Q1011=DAUH 190800Z 01004KT 6000 NSC 27/04 Q1011=DAUH 190730Z 02004KT 6000 NSC 24/04 Q1011=DAUH 190700Z 33006KT 6000 NSC 24/04 Q1011=DAUH 190630Z 35004KT 6000 NSC 23/M01 Q1011=DAUH 190600Z 16009KT 8000 NSC 23/M01 Q1011=DAUH 190530Z NIL=DAUH 190500Z 16009KT 8000 NSC 23/M03 Q1010=ZS-OUE sitting disabled on the runway (Photo: Amin Zerrouk):ZS-OUE sitting disabled on the runway: 
An Air France Airbus A340-300, registration F-GLZS performing flight AF-4001 from Fort de France (Martinique) to Moscow Sheremetyevo (Russia) with 266 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from runway 10 when tower instructed the aircraft to reject takeoff prompting the crew to reject takeoff at high speed (about 130 knots over ground). The aircraft slowed safely, vacated the runway via the turn off 2400 meters/7900 feet down the runway and stopped after crossing the hold short line, smoke was observed from the landing gear. Emergency services responded and cooled the brakes. The aircraft was subsequently towed to the apron, where passengers disembarked normally.The flight status of the airline confirmed the destination was Moscow Sheremetyevo. The flight was then expected to depart Fort de France with a delay of 22.5 hours for Paris Orly (France) stating the flight route had changed due to operational constraints.A replacement Boeing 777-300 registration F-GSQN positioned to Fort de France, resumed the flight with a delay of about 25 hours and flew to Paris Orly.The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground for about 45 hours, then resumed service.On Apr 19th 2017 The Aviation Herald received information that other than initial information suggested tower did not report smoke from the landing gear prompting the crew to reject takeoff, but received a call from the airline to have the aircraft return to the gate due to missing luggage while the aircraft was already in the departure roll.Flight status shown on Air France Website on Apr 17th 2017 (Graphics: Air France):
A Thomson Airways Boeing 787-800, registration G-TUIE performing flight BY-108 from Manchester,EN (UK) to Bridgetown (Barbados), was accelerating for takeoff from Manchester's runway 23R when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 84 knots over ground). The aircraft slowed safely and stopped on the runway, emergency services responded and checked the aircraft.The aircraft returned to the apron, but was able to depart about 140 minutes after the rejected takeoff. The aircraft is estimated to reach Bridgetown with a delay of 3:20 hours.British Media reported smoke was observed from the undercarriage prompting the rejected takeoff. A burst tyre was ruled out however.
An Alitalia Airbus A320-200, registration I-BIKC performing flight AZ-111 from Amsterdam (Netherlands) to Rome Fiumicino (Italy), was accelerating for takeoff from Amsterdam's runway 36L when the aircraft received a bird strike prompting the crew to reject takeoff at high speed (about 130 knots over ground). The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The occurrence aircraft was able to depart about 2:40 hours after the rejected takeoff and reached Rome with a delay of 2:50 hours.After landing in Rome the aircraft remained on the ground for about 4:45 hours then resumed normal service.
An American Airlines Airbus A321-200, registration N561UW performing flight AA-1820 from Denver,CO to Charlotte,NC (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from runway 08 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed and stopped the aircraft on the runway about 1400 meters/4600 feet down the runway. The crew reported the right hand engine's (V2533) thrust reverser had opened during the takeoff run. Emergency services were alerted for a stuck thrust reverser and possible flat tyre. Emergency services reported all tyres were still inflated.A replacement A321-200 registration N572UW reached Charlotte with a delay of 4:40 hours.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Denver about 22 hours later.Passenger video (Video: James Hadley):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaaElH7omKA
A Vincent Aviation British Aerospace Jetstream 32 on behalf of Air New Zealand, registration ZK-VAH performing flight NZ-2067 from Auckland to Taupo (New Zealand) with 14 passengers and 2 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Auckland's runway 23L just before 15:00L (02:00Z) when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed. While the aircraft slowed the aircraft veered left and came to a stop left off the runway about 1000 meters down the runway. No injuries occurred, the aircraft received minor if any damage.The runway was closed for about 45 minutes until the aircraft was towed to the apron.Ground Observer Noel Jones reported the aircraft obviously lost nose wheel steering prompting the crew to reject takeoff.Air New Zealand confirmed flight NZ-2067 carrying 14 passengers and 2 crew was involved in an incident at Auckland Airport shortly before 15:00L (02:00Z), when the aircraft rejected takeoff and left the runway. There were no injuries.On Apr 13th 2017 New Zealand's TAIC released their final report concluding the probable causes of the serious incident were:- The uncommanded turn to the left during take-off was caused by a faulty steering selector.- The defective component within the steering selector could not be determined because of incomplete overhaul records.- The isolated nature of the component failure in this occurrence, and the actions the manufacturer had previously undertaken, meant that additional changes to the relevant maintenance procedures were not warranted.The TAIC analysed:The taxi from the parking spot, which included several tight turns, and the initial line-up on the runway were normal. During the take-off the captain used the nose wheel steering tiller to control the heading and remain on the runway centreline. Small directional changes during the early phase of a take-off roll are not unusual and can have a number of causes, including starting the take-off with the nose wheel not aligned with the runway heading, an uneven application of engine power, and a crosswind. There was no indication of a control problem until the aeroplane started to veer left at about 70 knots.The uncommanded and unexpected turn to the left occurred below the take-off decision speed. The captains decision to stop the take-off was timely and correct. The captain then controlled the aeroplane using a combination of nose wheel steering, rudder, asymmetric braking and asymmetric reverse thrust as it approached the edge of the runway. The prompt response ensured that the aeroplane was at a slow speed when it left the runway.Steering system failureThe uncommanded turn to the left was determined to have been caused by a faulty steering selector. The steering selector had been installed on 20 July 2012 to replace another selector removed for scheduled overhaul.11 At the time of the incident the selector had accrued 575.7 hours in service over a period of 16 months and 931 landings. The allowable service life was 10,000 landings or six years, whichever came first.The examination of the steering selector after the incident traced the fault to incorrect spring tensions within the spring box of the steering selector, which affected the internal hydraulic pressure. This fault intermittently allowed uncontrolled hydraulic fluid to flow from the selector to the steering actuator, but only in the direction that turned the aeroplane to the left.The spring tensions and differential pressure can only be adjusted before the final assembly of the steering selector during manufacture or after overhaul. To ensure that the steering selector operates as intended, it is subjected to a full functional test after assembly. If the spring tension is incorrect, it should be identified during the functional test and be corrected before the steering selector is released for service.Metars:NZAA 020400Z AUTO 23017KT 9999 FEW035/// BKN060/// 16/08 Q1015 NOSIGNZAA 020330Z AUTO 23017KT 9999 FEW038/// SCT060/// 17/08 Q1015 NOSIGNZAA 020300Z AUTO 23017KT 9999 FEW038/// SCT050/// 16/09 Q1015 NOSIGNZAA 020230Z AUTO 23019KT 200V260 9999 NCD 17/09 Q1015 NOSIGNZAA 020200Z AUTO 23019KT 9999 FEW036/// SCT060/// 17/08 Q1016 NOSIGNZAA 020130Z AUTO 23017KT 9999 FEW039/// 16/09 Q1016 NOSIG NZAA 020100Z AUTO 23018KT 9999 -RA FEW035/// BKN060/// 17/08 Q1016 NOSIGNZAA 020030Z AUTO 23018KT 9999 FEW036/// SCT048/// BKN060/// 16/08 Q1016 NOSIG NZAA 020000Z AUTO 23016KT 9999 FEW036/// 17/08 Q1016 NOSIG NZAA 012330Z AUTO 23016KT 9999 NCD 16/09 Q1016 NOSIGNZAA 012300Z AUTO 23017KT 9999 FEW038/// SCT060/// 16/07 Q1016 NOSIGZK-VAH left off the runway (Photo: Noel Jones):
An Air Europa Airbus A330-200, registration EC-JQG performing positioning flight UX-6 from Madrid,SP (Spain) to Zurich (Switzerland), was cleared for takeoff from Madrid's runway 36R when the crew aborted takeoff due to brakes problems. The aircraft remained stationary at the threshold of the runway for about 80 minutes until the aircraft was able to vacate the runway.Due to the runway not being available a number of flights experienced delays.The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground in Madrid for about 7.5 hours, then was able to depart and reached Zurich.
A Lineas Aereas Suramericanas Boeing 727-200 freighter, registration HK-1271 performing a charter freight flight from Bogota to Pasto (Colombia) with 4 crew and a cargo of food, was accelerating for takeoff from Bogota's runway 13R at about 12:50L (17:50Z) when the crew needed to reject takeoff at high speed but were unable to stop the aircraft before the end of the runway. The aircraft went off the paved surface and came to a stop about 170 meters/570 feet past the end of the runway. There were no injuries, the aircraft sustained minor if any damage.Colombia's Aerocivil (Civil Aviation Authority) reported the runway was closed until 15:00L, then was re-opened with 3100 of 3600 meters length available. Aerocivil have opened an investigation into the occurrence.Metars:SKBO 102100Z 25007KT 5000 HZ BKN020 SCT080 16/11 A3022=SKBO 102034Z 26009KT 5000 VCSH BKN020 16/11 A3021 RMK VCSH/N HZ=SKBO 102000Z 24009KT 5000 -TSRA BKN017 FEW020CB 16/12 A3023 RMK CB/N HZ=SKBO 101900Z 25013KT 5000 TS BKN017 FEW020CB 17/12 A3024 RMK CB/N HZ=SKBO 101840Z 24013KT 5000 TS BKN020CB 18/13 A3025 RMK CB/N HZ=SKBO 101800Z 24013KT 5000 HZ BKN020TCU 18/13 A3027 RMK TCU/N/S=SKBO 101700Z 26004KT 9999 SCT020 SCT025TCU 20/11 A3030 RMK TCU/S/NW=SKBO 101615Z 33006KT 1500 TSRA SCT01CB OVC070 23/23 A2991 RMK CB/NE/NW AD BLW MNM MET=SKBO 101600Z 26005KT 9999 SCT020 FEW025TCU 18/09 A3032 RMK TCU/W=SKBO 101500Z 01005KT 9999 SCT017 SCT070 17/10 A3034=SKBO 101400Z 04006KT 8000 SCT017 15/11 A3035 RMK HZ=HK-1271 past the runway end (Photos: Colombia Aerocivil):Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):
A Batik Air Boeing 737-800, registration PK-LBS performing flight ID-7703 from Jakarta Halim Perdanakusuma to Ujung Padang (Indonesia) with 49 passengers and 7 crew, was in the takeoff roll on runway 24 at 19:55L (12:55Z) when its left wing tip entangled with the vertical tail and left wing of a Transnusa Avions de Transport Regional ATR-42-600 registration PK-TNJ crossing the runway under tow and separated the most of the vertical tail plane as well as the left wing from the ATR, the left wing tank ruptured open. Both aircraft caught fire, the Boeing was evacuated via slides. Fire engines responded and were able to put the fires out in a matter of minutes. There were no injuries, both aircraft received substantial damage.Indonesia's Ministry of Transport reported the Boeing was taxiing for departure, the ATR was under tow to a hangar when the aircraft collided causing damage to the left wing tip of the Boeing and separation of vertical tail and left wing of the ATR. There were no injuries. The airport needed to be closed however.Ground observers reported the Boeing 737-800 was already accelerating for takeoff from runway 24, when the ATR under tow crossed the runway about 1280 meters/4200 feet down the runway. The Boeing rejected takeoff but could not stop in time to avoid the collision.Radar data suggest the Boeing was accelerating for takeoff from runway 24 reaching about 110 knots over ground when takeoff was rejected. The aircraft came to a stop about 500 meters/1650 feet past the intersection of the runway with the only crossing taxiway.Batik Air reported their flight was cleared for takeoff and was accelerating when the aircraft under tow crossed the runway. Their crew rejected takeoff however could not avoid the collision.Indonesia's NTSC have opened an investigation into the accident.On Apr 5th 2016 Lembaga Penyelenggara Pelayanan Navigasi Penerbangan Indonesia (LPPNPI), ATC provider, reported that the tower controller on duty, his assistant as well as the supervisor were relieved from duties for at least three weeks because of emotional disorders and psychological effects of the accident on them. Indonesia's NTSC in the meantime is collecting data and is going to investigate the accident.On Apr 6th 2016 Indonesia's Ministry of Transport suspended all ground handling operations by Jasa Angkasa Semesta (JAS) at Halim Perdanakusuma Airport arguing that the ground handler failed to prevent the collision on the runway. The suspension, not affecting JAS operations on other Indonesian airports, remains in effect until JAS complies with NTSC recommendations.On Apr 11th 2016 Indonesia's NTSC released two safety recommendations to Indonesia's Ministry of Transport as result of the investigation so far: all aircraft operating within the runway area, irrespective of being powered, towed or otherwise, should be on the same frequency and all aircraft operating within the runway area, irrespective of being powered, towed or otherwise, should activate their position lights.On Apr 14th 2016 the French BEA reported based on preliminary information from NTSC Indonesia, that the Batik Boeing 737-800 had been cleared to enter runway 24 via taxiway C and backtrack the runway. In the meantime the tug driver of the Transnusa ATR requested clearance to cross the runway from the north to the south apron and received clearance to taxi via taxiway C, runway 06/24 and taxiway G. While crossing the runway the tug driver saw the Boeing 737 accelerate for takeoff and attempted to steer the tug and aircraft to the right runway shoulder, however the left wing of the Boeing collided with the vertical stabilizer and left wing of the ATR. The Boeing rejected takeoff and came to a stop 400 meters past the point of collision. The occurrence was rated an accident and is being investigated by Indonesia's NTSC.On May 11th 2016 Indonesia's NTSC released their preliminary report reporting, that the AT42 was being towed with two engineers on the flight deck (to apply brakes if needed during the tow) and the tow driver driving the tug, the systems on board of the AT42 were not (electrically) powered up, therefore neither navigation nor strobe lights nor radios for communication were up. Communication between tug driver and ATC was performed via a handheld radio on frequency 152.700MHz (not a frequency available on flight decks).The airport's tower was staffed by controller, assistant, supervisor and flight data officer. The NTSC annotated that the view to the runway 24 was difficult due to light reflections from the illuminated tower cab.The controllers reported not seeing any light except on the tug for the AT42. The B738, communicating on tower frequency 118.600MHz, was cleared to backtrack runway 24. The tug driver, towing the AT42 from the north apron to the south apron, was told to report on taxiway C, shortly after reported on taxiway C and was instructed to expedite the taxi by the assistant. The tug driver stated the taxiroute was via taxiway G which was affirmed by the assistant (editorial note: the report suggests that this exchange was taken as clearance to enter the runway by the tug driver although strictly formally a clearance to enter the runway had not been issued and the assistant obviously did not assume the AT42 would continue onto the runway, realizing this only after the collision when inquiring with the tug driver). The B738 was still backracking runway 24. Some time later the B738 performed the 180 and reported ready for takeoff. The controller checked the runway for any obstacles, did not see any vehicles or object on the runway and cleared the flight for takeoff.The NTSC then described the events:The pilot stated that during line up, the lights surround the turn pad were very bright and affected his forward vision for a short time. It was common practice in Halim to lineup at the turn pad beyond the threshold runway 24.After received the takeoff clearance, the Second in Command (SIC) as pilot flying (PF) opened the power and pressed the Take Off / Go Around (TOGA) button.The towing car driver stated that when he saw the ID 7703 was lining up for takeoff then asked to the Halim Tower whether the ID 7703 was initiating the takeoff, and there was no reply from the Halim Tower. The towing car driver then speeds up the towing and turned to the right side of the runway.When ID 7703 was on rolling takeoff at approximate 80 knots, the SIC saw an object and confirming to the Pilot in Command (PIC) concerning to the object. The pilots could not identify the object but later on when the object became closer, the SIC realized that there was an aircraft.The PIC took over control and applied the right rudder towards the right side of runway centerline and maintained between the runway centerline and the runway edge. The PIC intended to reject the takeoff shortly after the pilot felt an impact. The pilot performed the reject takeoff and the ID 7703 stopped at approximately 400 meter from the towed aircraft which stopped at the left of the runway 24 centerline at approximately 100 meters from taxiway G.The assistant saw fire on the left side of ID 7703 when the aircraft rolled between taxiway C and B. Then the assistant pressed the crash bell and informed Rescue and Fire Fighting Service (RFFS) about the fire.After the aircraft stopped, the PIC commanded to the SIC to perform ON GROUND EMERGENCY procedure, and commanded to the flight attendant ATTENTION CREW ON STATION twice. The PIC noticed fire on the left wing tip and immediately shut down both engines, activated the fire extinguishers of both engines and Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) and commanded to the flight attendant evacuation from the right.After the aircraft stopped and received the PIC command ATTENTION CREW ON STATION, the flight attendants checked the condition inside and outside the aircraft through the viewing window. There was no damage inside the aircraft and they did not see any fire outside the aircraft.The flight attendants opened all aircraft passenger doors and the escape slides deployed. Most of passengers were evacuated from the left forward door (1L).The pilots realized that the impacted object was a towing aircraft after they disembarked the aircraft.The air traffic controller set crew realized that the towed aircraft was on the runway and collided with ID 7703 after asked to the towing car driver.The left wing of the Boeing 737 struck the AT-42 about 850 meters down runway 24, the Boeing came to a stop about 400 meters further down the runway. The data stored by the flight data recorder suggest that the power levers were retarded after the collision and the autobrakes engaged at the same time, the speed increased by 14 knots between collision and engagement of autobrakes. Takeoff was rejected at about 130 KIAS.On Apr 10th 2017 Indonesia's NTSC (KNKT) released their final report concluding the probable causes of the accident were:- Handling of two movements in the same area with different controllers on separate frequencies without proper coordination resulted in the lack of awareness to the controllers, pilots and towing car driver.- The communication misunderstanding of the instruction to follow ID 7703 most likely contributed the towed aircraft enter the runway.- The lighting environments in the tower cab and turning pad area of runway 24 might have diminished the capability to the controllers and pilots to recognize the towed aircraft that was installed with insufficient lightings.The NTSC reported the communication with respect to the tow driver:On parking stand B-1:The towing car driver requested to Halim Control Tower Unit (Halim Tower) for towing to reposition an aircraft from parking stand B-1 to the south apron and was replied by the Flight Data Officer to standby. After the ID7703 started to taxi, the assistant controller issued towing clearance to the towing car driver and to report when on taxiway C.At about abeam parking stand B-9:The assistant controller instructed the towing car driver to expedite the towing and to follow ID 7703. The instruction was acknowledged by the towing aircraft driver.At about entering taxiway C:The assistant controller reinstructed the towing car driver to expedite the towing and to follow ID 7703. The instruction was acknowledged by the towing aircraft driver.Note: The air traffic control crew on duty stated that this communication did not occur.On taxiway C:The assistant controller reinstructed the towing car driver to expedite the towing and to follow ID 7703. The towing car driver confirmed that the taxi route was via taxiway G and affirmed by the assistant controller.Note: The air traffic control crew on duty stated that this communication did not occur.On the runway:The towing car driver asked twice to the Halim Tower unit whether the ID 7703 was initiating the takeoff and there was no reply.Note: The air traffic control crew on duty stated that this communication did not occur.After the collision:The assistant controller requested the towed aircraft position. The towing car driver informed that the towed aircraft was on the runway and had just collided with ID 7703.The NTSC analysed with respect to the tow driver:The instruction to follow the ID 7703 was given when the assistant controller did not maintain the continuous watch to the towed aircraft position and expected that the towing car driver would report when position on taxiway C. Meanwhile the towing car driver might interpret that the towed aircraft approved to enter the runway and considered the position report on taxiway C was no longer required. This communication misunderstanding most likely contributed the towed aircraft enter the runway.The NTSC analysed with respect to the tower controller:The lighting environment in the tower cab created glare on the window glass which increased the difficulty for the controllers to observe the towed aircraft that was not clearly visible, especially from the rear.With respect to the collision avoidance maneouvers attempted the NTSC analysed:During the takeoff roll, after the ID 7703 pilots noticed an object on the runway. At a speed of approximately 115 knots, the rudder and steering was deflected and the aircraft heading changed approximately 2 degrees to the right for about 2 seconds. This was the pilots action to deviate and maintain the aircraft position between the runway centerline and the runway edge. The pilot tried to avoid collision with the object and to stay on the runway. This action made the aircraft deviate approximately 6 meters to the right from the runway centerline.The towing car driver saw that the ID 7703 was on the takeoff roll, then accelerated the towing and turned to the right side of the runway. The investigation found that the towing car was on the grass after the impact and the aircraft was on a heading of approximately 080 degrees.Both aircraft had moved away from the runway centerline, however the ID 7703 left wing collided with the left wing and the vertical stabilizer of the towed aircraft. The decision of both the pilot and the towing car driver to move away from the runway centerline avoided a centerline (head to head) collision however the wing collision was unavoidable. The wing collision was less severe compared to an aircraft collision on the runway centerline.Metars (no later METARs available):WIHH 041200Z 04006KT 5000 HZ FEW017CB SCT018 30/25 Q1010 RMK CB TO SW WIHH 041100Z 04008KT 6000 SCT018 31/24 Q1008 NOSIG WIHH 041000Z 06012KT 7000 FEW018 32/23 Q1007 NOSIG WIHH 040900Z 06012KT 7000 FEW018 33/24 Q1007 NOSIG WIHH 040800Z 06010KT 7000 SCT018 33/24 Q1007 NOSIG The aftermath and emergency response (Video: Ippi Thyssen):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQZ98Dhf_NoView from cockpit while aligning with runway 24 of a flight departing Halim runway 24 just before the collision (Photo: NTSC):Wreckage distribution (Graphics: NTSC):The collision and fire damage of PK-TNJ (Photo: TunasKelapa):The collision and fire damage of PK-LBS (Photo: TunasKelapa):Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):

An Air Dolomiti Embraer ERJ-195 on behalf of Lufthansa, registration I-ADJO performing flight LH-2293 from Brussels (Belgium) to Munich (Germany) with 62 passengers and 5 crew, was cleared to line up runway 07R and wait, however, commenced their takeoff roll.An Aer Lingus Airbus A320-200, registration EI-EZW performing flight EI-638 from Dublin (Ireland) to Brussels (Belgium) with 156 passengers and 6 crew, was on very short final to Brussels' runway 01 below 250 feet AGL when tower - with raised voice - instructed the aircraft to go around as result of the unexpected takeoff by LH-2293. The aircraft positioned for another approach and landed safely about 11 minutes after the go-around.The Embraer crew got to hear that they had no takeoff clearance, but were now permitted to continue takeoff. The crew apologized after the aircraft had become airborne. The aircraft continued to destination for a safe landing.On Oct 20th 2016 Belgium's AIB reported that the occurrence was rated a serious incident and is being investigated.On Mar 30th 2017 Belgium's AIB released their final report concluding the probable cause of the serious incident (Class A) was:The incident was caused by the take-off without clearance of an aircraft instructed to line up and wait on Runway 07R while an aircraft was in final approach of Runway 01.Contributing factors- Not using a mnemonic and/or cross-check for the take-off clearance by the DLH4TX crew.- Limited traffic information/situational awareness given when delivering ATC clearances.- Inadequate doubt-clearing management in the cockpit.- The unfamiliarity of the crew with the airport.- Authorizing aircraft to line up on RWY 07R at a short distance from the intersection with RWY 01 without correlation with landing traffic on this latter.- Intersection and status of RWY 01 not indicated on RWY 07R.- The complex taxiway layout (junction connecting 6 taxiways right before C6, the oblique angled entry taxiway including a part of the taxiway centerline lights).The AIB reported that as soon as tower, who maintained good visual contact with the E195 due the close proximity to runway 01 and the short reaction times, noticed the E195 started moving he instructed the A320 to go around just as the A320 crew also having noticed the E195 moving was about to call tower.The AIB reported the tower controlled was shocked by the occurrence and needed to be replaced for the remainder of his shift.The AIB analysed human factors:The DLH4TX crew received an instruction from ATC, read it back correctly, but eventually did not follow it.We can compare this phenomenon with other human failures, such as passing a red light when driving the car without realizing. The frequency of this kind of human failure has been estimated for the rail sector (Buizingen railway accident report), specifically for the violation of red signals by train drivers. This estimation shows a failure rate of 10-5 for adequately selected and trained personnel.This figure is of the same magnitude as the rate of take-offs initiated without clearance at EBBR (2 events for 230000 registered movements per year).
A Norwegian Air Shuttle Boeing 737-800, registration LN-NGZ performing flight DY-9856 from Milwaukee,WI (USA) to Cancun (Mexico), had been cleared for takeoff from runway 19R and was accelerating for takeoff about 55 seconds after the takeoff clearance when ATC called "Stop!", the crew acknowledged, rejected takeoff at low speed, tower queried whether they could make taxiway "M", the crew affirmed and slowed the aircraft safely.About 3:40 minutes prior to the takeoff clearance tower had cleared an Expressjet Embraer ERJ-145 on behalf of United Airlines, registration N15980 performing flight UA-4088 from Cleveland,OH to Milwaukee,WI (USA), to land on Milwaukee's runway 25L. A passenger, who had also consulted LiveATC tower recordings of Milwaukee Airport, reported they had lined up runway 19R at taxiway F and were accelerating for takeoff from runway 19R when at about crossing the runway threshold the brakes came on and the aircraft rejected takeoff at low speed. The passenger wrote: "The reason for the rejected takeoff became clear when an E145 that was ExpressJet flight ASQ-4088 landing on crossing runway 25L appeared suddenly out of a backdrop of a bright low rising sun and clouds maybe 100-200ft on very short final that then continued for a safe landing."The Boeing 737 vacated the runway, returned to the holding point runway 19R at taxiway F and departed without further incident about 5 minutes after the rejected takeoff.Aerodrome Chart (Graphics: FAA):

The crew shut the engine down, the aircraft slowed safely, emergency services responded and checked the aircraft and engine, emergency services reported no visible fire. The aircraft returned to the apron about 10-15 minutes later, fire engines were following the aircraft.A replacement Boeing 757-200 registration G-LSAH reached Lanzarote with a delay of 2 hours.A ground observer reported the crew reported an engine fire, emergency services responded but did not see any fire, the runway was closed for about 10-15 minutes. Two of four fire engines followed the aircraft to the apron.
An Air Canada Boeing 787-900, registration C-FGHZ performing flight AC-57 from Dubai (United Arab Emirates) to Toronto,ON (Canada) with 302 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Dubai's runway 30R when the right hand engine (GEnx) suffered a compressor stall prompting the crew to reject takeoff at low speed. The aircraft vacated the runway 1000 meters/3300 feet down the runway and returned to the apron.The Canadian TSB reported maintenance performed an engine run at 70% N1 and found no faults. The engine, air intake and exhaust were checked in accordance with the maintenance manuals, wheels and brakes were checked and the aircraft was returned to service.The aircraft departed Dubai 2.5 hours after the rejected takeoff and reached Toronto with a delay of 2:20 hours.
A Monarch Airbus A321-200, registration G-OZBU performing flight ZB-970 from Birmingham,EN (UK) to Malaga,SP (Spain), was accelerating for takeoff from Birmingham's runway 15 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed. The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway about 2100 meters/6900 feet down the runway.A replacement Airbus A321-200 registration G-OZBG reached Malaga with a delay of 2 hours.A passenger reported the crew announced the aircraft had received a new engine (V2533) the previous night, the new engine overheated during the takeoff run prompting the rejected takeoff.The airline reported a technical issue prompted the rejected takeoff.
A Delta Airlines Airbus A330-300, registration N808NW performing flight DL-73 from Amsterdam (Netherlands) to Atlanta,GA (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Amsterdam's runway 24 at low speed (about 70 knots over ground) due to the failure of the green hydraulic system, the aircraft vacated the runway via taxiway S2 about 1800 meters/5900 feet down the runway and stopped clear of the runway. The crew requested to be towed to the apron, however, after about 5 minutes continued taxi towards the apron. Upon entering the apron the nose gear steering failed prompting the crew to stop, the aircraft was then towed into the gate.A passenger reported the captain announced their green hydraulic system had failed causing the reject of the takeff. The aircraft vacated the runway and stopped, then commenced taxi towards the apron, but brakes were applied hard upon entering the apron and the aircraft stopped. The captain announced they had needed to apply emergency brakes as the nose gear had taken an uncommanded turn. The aircraft was subsequently towed into the gate, passengers disembarked normally. A replacement Airbus A330-300 was readily available in Amsterdam due to the winterstorm in the USA, that had caused flight cancellations.A replacement A330-300 registration N803NW departed about 3.5 hours later and reached Atlanta with a delay of 3.5 hours.
A Go2Sky Boeing 737-800 on behalf of Norwegian Air Shuttle, registration LN-NII performing flight DY-277 from Kristiansand to Oslo (Norway), entered Kristiansand's runway 04, began to accelerate for takeoff, the crew rejected takeoff at low speed and stopped the aircraft after some distance. The aircraft remained in position for about 5 minutes, then accelerated for takeoff again and departed. The aircraft stopped the climb at FL150 and continued to Oslo for a landing without further incident about 40 minutes later.Radar data confirm the aircraft rolled about 230 meters upon first acceleration, stopped for about 5 minutes, then departed but did not climb above FL150 (while usually the aircraft would climb to above FL300).On Nov 14th 2016 a source told The Aviation Herald, that the crew received a takeoff configuration warning and rejected takeoff shutting down both engines, which caused all electrics to shut down as well including cabin lighting. While the flight crew was restarting the engines, cabin crew walked the aisles to calm passengers, the flight attendants expected another call by the crew to take their seats prior to takeoff, however, suddenly - with cabin crew still around the cabin in the aisles - the engines accelerated for takeoff and the aircraft departed with the cabin crew rushing to their seats. Climbing out of Kristiansand (usual cruise level FL300) the crew received a cabin altitude warning and levelled off at low altitude, it was later found the air conditioning systems had not been activated. The aircraft was operated by flight crew from Go2Sky and a cabin crew from Norwegian Air Shuttle.LN-NII is in the process of being handed over from Norwegian Air Shuttle to Go2Sky, the actual transfer of ownership is expected by early January 2017. Editorial Note: The aircraft had already been transferred onto the Air Operator's Certificate of Go2Sky prior to the occurrence according to CAA Norway's statement received on Dec 6th 2016.On Nov 14th 2016, immediately after receiving the above report, The Aviation Herald contacted Norway's AIBN to see, wether the occurrence was known and is being investigated. On Nov 23rd 2016 the AIBN responded stating: "The AIBN has not received any report matching your information (Operator, Registration, date, airport)."In the following The Aviation Herald received information that the occurrence has now been reported to the AIBN and shot off another e-mail on Nov 30th 2016, in addition the occurrence made it onto a number of pilot fora being reported by different sources, another source contacted The Aviation Herald directly confirming the first source's narrative. On Nov 30th 2016 the AIBN informed The Aviation Herald, that all investigators were out of house for a seminar, it would take a couple of days until a response was possible.The second source told The Aviation Herald, that the first officer, right after receiving the takeoff configuration warning, moved both engine start levers to shutoff which effectively shutdown both engines and generators leaving the aircraft dark on the runway. The captain subsequently started the APU, thereafter both engines were started again, then the crew accelerated for takeoff without informing anyone leaving a completely startled cabin crew in the cabin, who were trying to re-assure passengers. Following landing in Oslo the cabin crew decided to disembark and not continue schedule.On Dec 5th 2016, while still waiting for reply by AIBN to the second inquiry, The Aviation Herald received further evidence confirming the occurrence enabling this coverage. According to the evidence cabin crew reported that the aircraft departed Kristiansand with a delay of 2 hours following difficulties with the departure/arrival slots. Cabin crew provided a "cabin and galley secure" to the flight crew, the aircraft entered the runway and accelerated when suddenly all power was lost, the cabin went dark and the emergency lights activated. Cabin crew inquired with the flight deck but did not receive any reply that could be understood (there were language problems involved). Understanding that the flight crew was busy and expecting that the crew would call "be seated for takeoff" the flight attendant left the flight deck recommending to the flight crew to make an announcement to have the passengers re-assured, the announcement was made but confused the passengers, a number of passengers called for attention and wanted to get off the aircraft. While the flight attendant was in aisle at the passengers trying to re-assure those passengers the engines accelerated to takeoff power prompting the flight attendant to rush back to her seat and strap in. About 4-5 minutes after becoming airborne an alarm could be heard from the flight deck, the aircraft levelled off and the alarm became even easier to hear. The flight attendants decided to check the cockpit to make sure the pilots were awake, all flight attendants detected there was something wrong with the cabin pressure. Upon calling the flight deck there was no response, cabin crew attempted to enter the cockpit using the emergency code, while the code was entered the first officer responded and opened the door, however did not provide any information as to what was happening. Cabin crew decided to connect their oxygen masks to the portable oxygen bottles. The passengers noticed something was wrong. Finally it emerged they were about to land in Oslo in about 9 minutes, the cabin was cleared for landing, the flight crew called the cabin crew to take their seats for landing and the aircraft landed. After landing cabin crew insisted the flight crew would explain to the passengers what had happened, however, the announcement was unclear just mentioning a wrong switch. Cabin crew was alerted by the break down of crew communication. The occurrence was witnessed by a number of deadheading flight crew of Norwegian Air Shuttle.On Dec 6th 2016 Norway's Civil Aviation Authority told The Aviation Herald: "this occurrence has been reported according to Regulation 376/2014 on the reporting, analysis and follow-up of occurrences in civil aviation, i.e. to the competent authority of the AOC-holder Go2Sky. However, CAA-Norway is well aware of the occurrence and we are assuring that Norwegian (being an Norwegian AOC-holder) is addressing relevant issues raised by the occurrence."On Dec 6th 2016 Norwegian Air Shuttle confirmed the events as described. The spokesperson believed however that the engines were shut down because the crew was waiting for departure clearance. Following departure the aircraft maintained a lower altitude than planned due to problems with the cabin pressure. Norwegian is following up this event with Go2Sky, who have been operating the flight under "damp lease".On Dec 6th 2016 the AIBN told Norwegian Media they are (now) aware of the occurrence (The Aviation Herald has not yet received direct information from the AIBN). A decision whether to investigate the occurrence has not yet been reached.In the evening of Dec 6th 2016 Go2Sky told Austrianwings (however did not respond to an inquiry by The Aviation Herald nor did Go2Sky attempt to contact The Aviation Herald, though a number of staff posted in the reader comments) repeatedly stating the information as provided by The Aviation Herald above was incorrect, that the takeoff configuration warning resulted from the park brakes being set. In a slip, that the first officer was unable to explain, the first officer as pilot flying reacted very non-standard and shut down both engines, the aircraft stopped. Then the pilots did all actions necessary to start the engines again and power the aircraft up. A recalculation of the takeoff performance was not necessary however. "This situation did not have any impact on aircraft and passenger safety, it was just human error." the airline said. The situation was explained to the passengers and the aircraft proceeded to Oslo. "There were no injuries of passengers or damage of the aircraft, shut-off engines on the ground is not safety incident." the airline continued. The occurrence has been reported to the Ministry of Transport of the Slovak Republic. When asked about the reason for the audible alert during climb the airline simply answered "No". The airline stated that operating and deadheading crew members of Norwegian Air Shuttle were debriefed in Oslo.On Dec 7th 2016 Norway's AIBN sent following mail: "We promised to get back to you on the matter and we can with reference to yesterday's correspondence confirm that we now are made aware of the occurrence from the Norwegian CAA. FYI we also checked and searched internally for misfiled or lost reports just in case."On Mar 11th 2017 The Aviation Herald became aware of a letter in Norwegian dated Feb 20th 2017 that Norway's AIBN sent to Norway's Ministry of Transport stating that after review of the available information the occurrence was rated an incident and is not being investigated by the AIBN.The AIBN reported that the occurrence had not been reported to the AIBN prior to media contacting the AIBN. The AIBN secured data of the flight including communication, flight data recorder and radar data. The AIBN reported that the flight had a number of hours delay due to weather at Oslo's Gardermoen Airport. The flight then received a slot to depart from Kristiansand. The aircraft was ready for departure about 5 minutes prior to the slot time assigned to the flight. With no other traffic around the aircraft received clearance to line up and wait as needed. The aircraft taxied into position and held, the park brake was set as a natural choice. Upon slot time the aircraft was cleared for takeoff, the engine power was increased for takeoff, due to the park brake still being set the takeoff configuration warning activated. The first officer (881 hours total, 445 hours on type) accidentally shut down both engines, which resulted in the loss of electrical power for most systems depending on electrical power, the aircraft was powered only by battery. According to the flight data recorder the aircraft rolled for 20 meters and stopped.Tower observed that the aircraft blacked out, but the exterior emergency lighting came on. To restart the aircraft the crew first needed to start the APU, also needed to start the air conditioning and cabin pressure system. After some time both engines were restarted and the navigation systems of the aircraft were put back into operation (editorial note: the aircraft transponder's position registers are being supplied by the navigation systems, the transponder then transmits those position data, which showed a movement of 230 meters - the AIBN report now offers an explanation for this suggesting - without actually writing it - that the navigation system and its position data were no longer reliable when the engines were shut down).As the aircraft was still ahead of the runway threshold, no recomputation of takeoff performance was needed. The pilots did not announce that cabin crew should take their seats for departure, and the takeoff roll began before cabin crew were seated and strapped in.Following departure the aircraft began to climb to planned cruise level FL330. However, when the aircraft climbed through FL140 the crew received a warning concerning the cabin pressure and stopped the climb at FL150. The crew discovered that the cabin pressurization had not been turned on and engaged the cabin pressurization, however in such a way that cabin pressure could not quickly be recovered. The cabin pressure alert continued to sound for 5 minutes. The crew advised ATC they had a technical problem and requested to continue the flight to Oslo at FL150, however no priority and no assistance was needed at Gardermoen.The AIBN reported that cabin crew heard continous alert sounds from the cockpit and felt at the same time that the cabin pressure was not normal. The purser attempted to contact the cockpit via Intercom, however, was unable to reach the cockpit crew due to the aircraft system assigning priority to the aural alerts over the Intercom. As the cabin crew could not get into contact with the flight crew and was worried about what was going on on the cockpit, the purser used the emergency access code to the cockpit and entered the cockpit, however, due to language problems could not get reasonable explanation as to what had happened. Cabin crew therefore, on own initiative, decided to don their oxygen masks.Radar and communication data suggest that the flight progressed without any further difficulty from there on. After landing cabin crew left the aircraft.
A KLM Boeing 747-400, registration PH-BFV performing flight KL-898 from Beijing (China) to Amsterdam (Netherlands), was accelerating for takeoff from Beijing's runway 36R when the #1 engine (CF6, outboard left hand) emitted a loud bang and streaks of flame prompting the crew to reject takeoff at low speed. The aircraft slowed safely and stopped on the runway about 1200 meters/4000 feet down the runway. Emergency services responded.PH-BFV being inspected by emergency services (Photo: Jaws300):
A LATAM Airlines Brasil Airbus A320-200, registration PT-MZY performing flight JJ-3264 from Sao Paulo Congonhas,SP to Belo Horizonte,MG (Brazil) with 131 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating the engines for takeoff from Congonhas Airport's runway 17R at about 18:48L (21:48Z) when the right hand engine (V2527) failed after about 3 seconds and an engine fire indication activated prompting the crew to reject takeoff. Emergency services responded and sprayed the engine. The aircraft was subsequently towed to the apron, where passengers disembarked normally.The aerodrome was closed until 20:07L.A ground observer reported the engine emitted a huge bang and streaks of flame through the engine exhaust pipe about 3 seconds after the engines began to accelerate.The airline reported the crew rejected takeoff due to an engine fire indication. The engine failure and fire indication are under investigation.The airport reported the runway needed to be cleaned before it could return to service.On Mar 10h 2017 Brazil's CENIPA reported a fault occurred in the right hand engine which prompted the crew to reject takeoff. While slowing down the main gear left the left side of the runway for about 150 meters/500 feet. The aircraft returned to the center line of the runway and came to a stop about one third of runway length down the runway (runway length 1940 meters/6365 feet, one third being 646 meters/2122 feet). Witnesses described phenomena similiar to a compressor stall. The occurrence was rated a serious incident and is being investigated by CENIPA.PT-MZY seen back at the apron:
An Allegiant Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-83, registration N865GA performing flight G4-890 from St. Petersburg,FL to Fort Wayne,IN (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from St. Petersburg's runway 36 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed. After coming to a stop the crew requested someone to check their tyres, they believed they had blown a tyre. Emergency services responded but found no damaged tyre. However, debris was found on the runway.The airline reported the aircraft rejected takeoff due to a maintenance issue, the passengers disembarked safely and normally. Maintenance is checking the aircraft. The debris on the runway might have been related to an internal failure of an engine (JT8D).A replacement MD-83 registration N875GA reached Fort Wayne with a delay of 4 hours.

The aircraft rolled along the runway at low speed, vacated the runway at the first exit about 200 meters/650 feet down the runway and returned to the apron.The cargo bays were inspected and cargo removed from the bays.About 2 hours later the aircraft taxied out to runway 05R again, stopped for about 10 minutes holding short of the runway due to the odour re-occurring. The crew shut down two packs, lined up runway 05R, and the flight departed. Later in the flight the packs were re-engaged and the flight continued to Frankfurt for a safe landing without further incident with a delay of 1:45 hours. The occurrence aircraft resumed service after 46 hours on the ground in Frankfurt.On Feb 15th 2017 The Aviation Herald received information, that a flight attendant became sick during the flight as result of the fumes and is still on sick leave in bad condition two weeks later.On Feb 15th 2017 The Aviation Herald also received information, that maintenance checked the aircraft after landing in Frankfurt but could not find any anomaly stating the odour could not be attributed to the aircraft. The long ground time in Frankfurt was not related to the fume event but to scheduled maintenance.On Feb 16th 2017 Germany's BFU reported that they are not aware of the occurrence.
An Aerolineas Argentina Airbus A330-200, registration LV-FNJ performing flight AR-1301 from New York JFK,NY (USA) to Buenos Aires Ezeiza,BA (Argentina), was accelerating for takeoff from JFK's runway 31L when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 30 knots over ground) after the right hand engine (PW4168) emitted a loud bang. The crew of another aircraft reported seeing the right hand engine on fire, the Aerolineas crew reported they had no fire indication. The aircraft stopped on the runway, emergency services responded. The Aerolineas crew reported they had shut down the engine, there was no fire indication, they just had "a minor explosion". The crew of the other aircraft reported that the fire had gone out in the meantime. Emergency services reported seeing no evidence of a fire. The aircraft taxied back the apron.Passenger videos reveal a large bang and streaks of flame from the engine followed by unusual noises.The airline reported the #2 engine experienced an engine stall. The airline wrote: "This situation can be generated when the flow of income engine air suffers an alteration and as a result it produces a sound similar to an explosion. The fact was confined to this engine and no intervention was necessary on the part of authorities at the airport. It is also important to clarify that there wasn't any fire." The airline is currently working to rebook the passengers onto other flights.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in New York about 13 hours after the rejected takeoff.Passenger video (Video: TN Noticias):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5jMbBe0qtUAnother passenger video (Video: Los videos del Momento TV y WEB):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Tom7RFmPUPhoto by a passenger on another aircraft waiting for departure (Photo: Alice X.

The flight crew stopped the climb at 6000 feet and returned to Mexicali for a safe landing on runway 28 about 15 minutes after departure.Mexico's AIB rated the occurrence a serious incident and opened an investigation.The occurrence aircraft was able to depart again after about 2.5 hours on the ground and reached Culiacan with a delay of 2.5 hours.
An Emirates Airlines Boeing 777-300, registration A6-EGL performing flight EK-399 from Denpasar (Indonesia) to Dubai (United Arab Emirates), was accelerating for takeoff from Denpasar's runway 27 when the crew received a cargo smoke indication and rejected takeoff at high speed (above 100 KIAS). The aircraft slowed safely and stopped on the runway about 1900 meters/6200 feet down the runway while emergency services responded and inspected the aircraft. About 20 minutes later the aircraft was released to taxi to the apron.A passenger reported the captain announced a cargo smoke detector had triggered. The aircraft returned to the apron and the passengers disembarked, upon getting off the aircraft the passenger noticed at least one flat tyre on the main gear. The crew indicated that a fire bottle had been discharged in response to the cargo smoke warning.The occurrence aircraft was able to depart as flight EK-399D about 17 hours after the rejected takeoff.
A Germania Boeing 737-700, registration D-ABLB performing flight ST-6129 from Las Palmas,CI (Spain) to Friedrichshafen (Germany) with 135 passengers and 5 crew, was cleared for takeoff from Las Palmas' Gran Canaria Airport's runway 03R at about 14:48Z and began acceleration, when ATC realized the runway was closed for work in progress and instructed the aircraft to reject takeoff. The crew rejected takeoff at low speed, then backtracked the runway to the threshold, subsequently lined up runway 03L and departed from runway 03L without further incident about 5 minutes later. The aircraft landed safely in Friedrichshafen about 4 hours later.On Feb 9th 2016 Spain's CIAIAC reported an investigation has been opened into the occurrence. On Nov 21st 2016 the CIAIAC released their final report in Spanish concluding the probable causes of the incident were:- the controller did not detect his error although several visual measures were implemented to identify the runway was closed. The controller neither detected the physical presence of the car on the side of runway (which did not have anti-collision beacons on), nor did the controller detect the presence of the flight strip indicating a car was on the runway.- the controller partially heard a transmission from the aircraft querying the stop bar lights being on, but did not request to repeat that transmission and instructed the aircraft again to line up and wait on runway 03R.- the crew taxied past the active stop bar lights without requesting those lights to be turned off or receive contingency information why the stop bars could not be turned off. The respective instructions in the manuals may have contributed being unclear and not specific.- the crew commenced the takeoff roll despite having visual contact with the car on the side of the runway.- a mitigating measure to place cones near the runway threshold to indicate the temporary closure of the runway was not approved by the local runway safety committee although the measure had been proposed to the committeeOn Jan 17th 2017 the CIAIAC released their English version of the final report writing following conclusion (the original AVH translation of the Spanish conclusions unmodified above):The incident was caused by the controllers loss of situational awareness, as he instructed the crew of GMI6129 to enter and then take off from runway 03R, despite knowing that it was closed. Contributing to the incident was a series of factors that bypassed the safety barriers that could have prevented its occurrence:- The controller did not detect his mistake despite the presence of visual aids in the tower indicating that the runway was closed. He also did not see the car in the runway 03R strip, though this may have been caused, as per the statement from the crew and the controller, by the fact that the car did not have its flashing lights on.- The controller only partially heard a report from the crew notifying that the stop bar was illuminated, but he did not ask for the message to be repeated and again instructed the crew to line up and wait. - The crew crossed an illuminated stop bar without having information regarding contingency measures in place to speciically allow this. Contributing to this is the fact that the regulation on stop bars and the applicable manuals are not clear or specific.- The aircrafts crew started the takeoff run despite being in visual contact with the car that was stopped on the runway strip.- The mitigation measure of placing cones at the threshold of the temporarily closed runway was not in effect, since the minutes of the Local Runway Safety Committee meeting, where this measure had been proposed, were not yet approved.The investigation released two safety recommendations as result.The CIAIAC reported that the closure of runway 03R had been NOTAMed. Both the tower controller as well as the crew knew, runway 03R was closed.The tower controller correctly instructed a preceding departure to line up runway 03L and cleared the flight for takeoff from runway 03L. However, when a couple of minutes later the Germania taxied for departure, tower instructed the aircraft to cross runway 03L, line up and wait runway 03R. The crew taxied the aircraft across runway 03L, noticed the active stop bars ahead of runway 03R and queried tower, tower however repeated the instruction to line up runway 03R. The crew thus taxied across the active stop bar lights and lined up runway 03R. About two minutes later tower cleared the flight for takeoff from runway 03R, however, cancelled the takeoff clearance after the aircraft had rolled about 270 meters/900 feet.The CIAIAC reported the captain of the flight (36, ATPL) had accumulated 6,550 hours total, 6,030 hours on type, the first officer (26, CPL) had accumulated 1000 hours total with 650 hours on type.The tower controller (38) had acquired his controller's license in 2008 and had been controlling at Las Palmas since 2010. In 2013 he became supervisor and became instructor in 2014.At the time of the occurrence visual meteorologic conditions prevailed with good visibility, scattered cloud ceiling was at 2500 feet.The CIAIAC analysed that on the day of the occurrence survey work was being conducted on the side strips of the runway requiring the closure of the runway. A car with a driver inside was performing the survey and was placed on the side strip of the runway. A flight strip indicating a vehicle on the runway had been placed onto the runway 03R stack on the controller's desk by the outgoing controller, the incoming controller was informed about the runway closure and started duties about 30 minutes prior to the occurrence initially correctly instructing aircraft onto runway 03L for a single runway operation.The CIAIAC analysed that a new procedures for helicopters had come into effect and the controller was still paying full attention onto there very complex procedures requiring a lot of coordination. A helicopter thus required his full attention when the Germania reported ready for departure. The stress and concentration produced by the helicopter prevented the controller to pay full attention to the Boeing. After issuing the crossing clearance for runway 03L to the Germania the controller handed the previous departure off to departure twice, however did not receive a reply on both transmissions, then the Germania queried the stop bar lights. At that time the tower controller also monitored departure frequency to find out whether the previous departure had already contacted departure on their own, hence missed part of the transmission querying the stop bar lights, but did not request to repeat the transmission but repeated his instruction to line up runway 03R and wait without realizing why the crew had called in.When the controller subsequently issued takeoff clearance he did not check the runway bay at his desk and thus did not notice the flight strip placed into there, nor did he spot the physical presence of the vehicle at the edge of the runway. The vehicle did not have anti-collision beacons activated, it's colour may have contributed to make the car difficult to spot on the runway surface. The controller suggested to place another marker for runway closure in front of the wind indicators as an immediate safety action, which was deemed sufficient by the investigation.The controller finally spotted the vehicle on the runway only after the takeoff clearance had been transmitted and cancelled the takeoff clearance.The CIAIAC analysed that the airport operator reported the car was equipped with anti-collision lights and that these lights had been operating at the time of the occurrence. The CIAIAC stated however that it was unlikely the collision lights were on given the controller as well as the crew did not see the vehicle before entering the runway.The CIAIAC analysed that the crew was aware of the NOTAMs indicating the closure of runway 03R and was confused by the instruction to cross runway 03L and line up runway 03R but as the instruction was repeated decided to follow the instruction. Once approaching the hold short line of runway 03R they noticed the active stop bar and queried again, slowed and stopped the aircraft, but were again instructed to line up runway 03R which was also deemed clearance to cross the active stop bar lights. However, no crew is authorized to cross active stop bar lights except for receiving explicit clearance to cross the stop bar lights unless the lights are off.The CIAIAC analysed that after line up the crew acquired visual contact with the vehicle but considered that there was no danger of collision with the vehicle when they received takeoff clearance and commenced takeoff. The runway strip is part of the runway used to reduce risks and damage for aircraft and occupants in case of runway excursions. The crew also did not know the intentions of the car driver being on a different frequency. After tower cancelled the takeoff clearance the crew complied with that instruction and stopped the aircraft.The CIAIAC analysed that ICAO regulations stipulate that no aircraft is permitted to cross active stop bar lights. However, ICAO also defines contingency procedures to permit an aircraft past active stop bar lights. There is no standardized procedure however to make clear in communication that such a contingency procedure was being used, which could contribute to misunderstandings and confusions.In a meeting of the local aerodrome's safety committee on Dec 1st 2015 the aerodrome proposed following a number of occurrences, that cones should be placed near the threshold of the runway to indicate the runway was closed. The measures should be implemented immediately. However, the safety committee did not adopt these measures until Jan 15th 2016. The cones could have established another safety barrier to prevent the occurrence.Relevant NOTAM active on Jan 7th 2016:B9738/15 NOTAMNQ) GCCC/QMRLC/IV/NBO/A /000/999/2756N01523W005A) GCLP B) 1601070800 C) 1601071820 ESTE) RWY 03R/21L CLSD EXC EMERG MIL NOTAM in archive for Jan 7th 2016 but not active (and shown as cancelled however this NOTAM was highlighted as the only one):B9736/15 NOTAMNQ) GCCC/QMRLC/IV/NBO/A /000/999/2756N01523W005A) GCLP B) 1601120800 C) 1601121820 ESTE) RWY 03L/21R CLSD EXCEPT SEGMENT A5 The controller's desk with a flight strip in bay and additional red marker across wind instruments (Photo: CIAIAC):Aircraft trajectory and vehicle position (Graphics: CIAIAC):
An Endeavor Canadair CRJ-200 on behalf of Delta, registration N8938A performing flight DL-4069 from New York JFK,NY to Buffalo,NY (USA), was cleared for takeoff from JFK's runway 31L when arriving traffic was 2.5nm out but needed to reject takeoff reporting a configuration warning about 20 seconds and queried they could vacate the runway via JB about 140 meters/460 feet down the runway. Tower replied "Yes, do it quickly, traffic behind you is 1.5nm out" and advised the arriving traffic "traffic aborted takeoff, cleared to land runway 31L if he gets off the runway fast enough". The CRJ vacated the runway, the arriving traffic continued for a safe landing.The crew of CRJ subsequently reported they had an avionics configuration warning. After working the checklists the crew taxied the aircraft to the holding point runway 31L. The aircraft was able to depart and reached Buffalo on schedule.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/EDV4069/history/20170115/1805Z/KJFK/KBUF
A Transstates Airlines Embraer ERJ-145 on behalf of United, registration N14116 performing flight UA-4629 from Fargo,ND to Denver,CO (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Fargo's runway 36 when both right main tyres became damaged. The crew rejected takeoff, slowed the aircraft safely and brought the aircraft to a stop on the runway. The aircraft subsequently was able to vacate the runway and taxi to the apron.The airport reported the aircraft was accelerating for takeoff when both right hand rear tyres blew. The runway was inspected. The flight was cancelled, the passengers were rebooked onto other flights.On Jan 10th 2017 the FAA reported the aircraft sustained unknown damage to the landing gear on takeoff. The FAA erroneously reported the aircraft involved carried the tail number N11137. That aircraft had not been in Fargo at the time of the occurrence according to radar data. Radar data, pictorial and video evidence as well as the airline identify the aircraft involved as N14116.The right hand main tyres seen back at the apron (Photo: Jim Monk):
A Lufthansa Airbus A340-600, registration D-AIHH performing flight LH-730 from Munich (Germany) to Hong Kong (China), was accelerating for takeoff from Munich's runway 08L at low speed (about 60 knots over ground), the crew reported the right hand engine (Trent 556) had stalled. The aircraft slowed safely, taxied along the runway, vacated the runway at the first exit about 1400 meters down the runway and returned to the apron.A runway inspection reported the runway was wet from de-icing fluid, otherwise clean.The flight was postponed to the next day.A passenger reported the crew announced inconsistencies in their indications as cause for the rejected takeoff, stopped for about 15 minutes on a taxiway trying to sort the problem out, then returned to the gate. The flight was postponed to the next day.A replacement Airbus A340-600 registration D-AIHX reached Hong Kong with a delay of 15.5 hours.
A British Airways Airbus A320-200, registration G-GATK performing flight BA-2713 from Malaga,SP (Spain) to London Gatwick,EN (UK), lined up Malaga's runway 31 full length and was accelerating for takeoff at 20:00L (19:00Z) when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed. The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway via the first high speed turnoff about 1900 meters down the runway and returned to the apron.The aircraft was able to depart about 80 minutes later and reached Gatwick with a delay of 2 hours.A passenger reported the captain announced that following the rejected takeoff the tyres and brakes needed to be checked as well as the fuel being topped up. The passenger understood the captain saying that ATC had assigned them to a different runway than expected (runway 13 was obviously expected), during the takeoff run some system raised a safety issue leading to the decision to reject takeoff.According to radar data the aircraft had arrived into Malaga as flight BA-2712 landing on runway 13 at 18:56L (17:56Z).Metars:LEMG 032030Z 31006KT CAVOK 13/09 Q1026 NOSIGLEMG 032000Z 29009KT CAVOK 14/09 Q1026 NOSIGLEMG 031930Z 28005KT CAVOK 13/08 Q1026 NOSIGLEMG 031900Z 27004KT CAVOK 16/08 Q1026 NOSIGLEMG 031830Z 27005KT CAVOK 15/08 Q1025 NOSIGLEMG 031800Z 27006KT CAVOK 17/09 Q1025 NOSIGLEMG 031730Z 26006KT CAVOK 17/08 Q1025 NOSIGLEMG 031700Z 28002KT CAVOK 17/09 Q1025 NOSIGLEMG 031630Z 00000KT CAVOK 19/10 Q1025 NOSIGLEMG 031600Z 00000KT CAVOK 19/11 Q1025 NOSIG
A Vueling Airbus A320-200, registration EC-MFK performing flight VY-9013 from Malaga,SP (Spain) to Toulouse (France), was accelerating for takeoff from Malaga's runway 13 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed after an engine (V2527) ingested a bird. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.A replacement Airbus A320-200 registration EC-MBY reached Toulouse with a delay of 2:15 hours.A passenger reported the captain announced a bird in the engine prompted the rejected takeoff. The aircraft returned to the apron, the passengers disembarked normally and were directed to a replacement aircraft.
A Delta Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-88, registration N934DL performing flight DL-1633 from Detroit,MI to Miami,FL (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from runway 21R when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed due to the failure of the left hand engine (JT8D). The aircraft slowed safely.The FAA reported the contained engine failure caused a PSU Panel to come loose, debris of the engine was found on the runway. A replacement MD-88 registration N942DL reached Miami with a delay of 3 hours.
An Azur Air Boeing 767-300, registration VQ-BSY performing flight ZF-9633 from Ekaterinburg (Russia) to Phuket (Thailand) with 335 passengers and 10 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Ekaterinburg's runway 26R at 01:01L (20:01Z Dec 20th) when the crew heard a bang from the right hand side and observed abnormal right hand engine (CF6) readings and rejected takeoff at high speed (about 145 knots over ground). The aircraft slowed but overran the end of the runway by about 20 meters and became disabled. The passengers disembarked normally and were bussed to the terminal.The airport was closed for about 3.5 hours until the aircraft was towed back to the apron.A replacement Boeing 767-300 registration VP-BXW positioned from Moscow to Ekaterinburg and departed for flight ZF-9633 with a delay of 10.5 hours.Ural's Transport Investigation Office opened an investigation.Metars:USSS 202130Z 00000MPS 6000 SCT004 M38/M42 Q1023 R26R/420244 NOSIG RMK QFE747/0996 USSS 202100Z 00000MPS 6000 SCT003 M38/M42 Q1024 R26R/420244 NOSIG RMK QFE747/0996 USSS 202030Z 15001MPS 5000 BR SCT004 M38/M42 Q1024 R26R/420244 NOSIG RMK QFE747/0996USSS 202000Z 00000MPS 3800 BR SCT005 M39/M42 Q1025 R26R/420242 NOSIG RMK QFE748/0997USSS 201930Z 15001MPS 5000 BR FEW010 M40/M44 Q1025 R26R/420242 NOSIG RMK QFE748/0997USSS 201900Z VRB01MPS 5000 BR FEW008 M38/M41 Q1025 R26R/490137 TEMPO BKN004 RMK QFE748/0997 USSS 201830Z 13002MPS 5000 BR FEW008 M39/M42 Q1025 R26R/490137 TEMPO BKN004 RMK QFE748/0997 USSS 201800Z 00000MPS 1600 1200E R26R/P2000D BR SCT006 M38/M42 Q1026 R26R/490137 TEMPO BKN004 RMK QFE748/0998 USSS 201730Z 17001MPS 5000 BR SCT008 M39/M42 Q1026 R26R/490137 TEMPO BKN004 RMK QFE748/0998 
A US Airways Boeing 767-200, registration N251AY performing flight US-1041 from Saint Thomas (US Virgin Islands) to Charlotte,NC (USA) with 174 passengers, was on approach to Charlotte, when the crew reported a number of passengers and cabin crew had noticed some odour on board shortly after takeoff and were now suffering from headache and nausea raising the alert of a possible carbon monoxide poisoning. The airplane continued for a safe landing on Charlotte's runway 23 and was received by about a dozen ambulances at the gate. 8 passengers were checked and treated on scene by medical staff, but were able to catch their connecting flights, 7 crew members were taken to a local hospital as a precaution.US Airways reported, that the initial suspect of carbon monoxide did not verify, the cause of the odour and nausea is under investigation. The airplane has been taken out of service.In March 2010 US Airways confirmed, that engine oil had leaked through a faulty seal into the bleed air supplying the air conditioning system.On December 18th 2016 The Aviation Herald learned, that the captain of the flight died as result of the circumstances at the occurrence and its aftermath, the first officer is permanently injured and has lost his medical as result of the occurrence. As result The Aviation Herald re-rated the occurrence from incident to accident.According to court documents the crew had performed flight US-1018 from Philadelphia,PA (USA) to Saint Thomas, the flight had been uneventful. On the next sector US-1041 the aircraft was enroute, when the purser entered the cockpit to provide the flight crew with meals and asked the pilots whether they felt alright. Both crew looked at each other in puzzlement, then noticed that their eyes were "quite red". Only at that point they realized that they were experiencing "some basic symptoms of headache, sore throat, a little bit of stiffness in the neck." Both pilots stated, that they never observed any odour in the cockpit nor was there any visible haze or smoke. The flight attendants reported that there was a random odour in the cabin, all cabin crew observed the "dirty socks type slash old gym bag, dirty laundry type smell", that occurred first during the climb out of Saint Thomas. The pilots reported, that in the later stages of the flight they felt fatigue, wooziness and grogginess and had the feeling of needing to concentrate much more than usual to perform the landing, which was done by the first officer, pilot flying for the sector. In the later stages of the flight the flight crew sent an ACARS message to their dispatch to request medical examination for the entire crew. After landing the flight attendants made an announcement to passengers that paramedics were available in case anyone experienced unusual symptoms, a number of passengers took up on that offer. Paramedics checked out both pilots and immediately put them on oxygen and took their vital signs. The entire crew was then taken to a hospital, which found elevated levels of carboxyhemoglobin, that was still substantial above normal after having been on oxygen for 2.5 hours. The headache got worse and lasted for about a week, the sore throat, red eyes and stiffness lasted for a week to 10 days, the fatigue and grogginess never went away. Subsequent medical examination revealed reduction of respiratory pulmonary functions. Both flight crew never returned to fly as pilots, both pilots had their medicals cancelled.On Dec 18th 2016 The Aviation Herald received note that the captain had died as the aftermath of the occurrence. The note concluded: "I'm writing to tell you that the world lost a great man. And I'm also writing to ask you to honor his life in whatever way you can - say a prayer, tell a joke (he was big on jokes), support a friend who needs support, convince your union to donate funds for the oil fumes research, do the world some kindness - because he was a kind, gentle, and brave soul, and his life matters."On Dec 19th 2016 a deepened research identified the occurrence flight had indeed been performed on Jan 16th on N251AY (rather than Jan 17th N255AY according to information available on Jan 18th 2010). On Mar 17th 2010 the FAA reported that on Mar 16th 2010 N251AY performing flight US-985 from Charlotte,NC (USA) to Montego Bay (Jamaica) needed to return to the gate after an electrical odour was noticed on board during taxi. Two faulty aft door seals were identified, which together with a strong tail wind permitted engine exhaust into the aircraft. 9 people, two pilots, 5 flight attendants and two passengers, were taken to a Charlotte hospital with symptoms consistent with exposure to toxic fumes.The FAA continued on Mar 17th 2010, that the aircraft involved in US-985, tail 251, had also been involved in flight US-1041 of Jan 16th 2010 and in two flights to Puerto Rico on Dec 28th 2009 and Dec 30th 2009. On both flights in December 2009 there had been hydraulic leaks, crew members felt unwell but were not taken to hospitals. The Association of Flight Attendants reported on Mar 17th 2010, that eight pilots and cabin crew members, including all but one crew members of flight US-1041 of Jan 16th 2010, did not return to work following three fume events on this aircraft in December 2009 and January 2010. The crew members are suffering from symptoms consistent with exposure to toxic fumes. The union was skeptical that faulty aft door seals would explain the occurrences.On Dec 19th 2016 a check of both FAA incident databases as well as NTSB investigation lists revealed, that neither of the four occurrences are listed in either database, neither database contains any entry at any time involving N251AY.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/AWE1041/history/20100116/2157Z/TIST/KCLT
A Lufthansa Airbus A330-300, registration D-AIKJ performing flight LH-435 from Chicago O'Hare,IL (USA) to Munich (Germany) with 182 passengers and 15 crew, departed Chicago's runway 32R at 21:54L (03:54Z Mar 6th) but struck its tail onto the runway during rotation for takeoff. The tailstrike went unnoticed, the crew maintained routine communication throughout the flight, the flight was continued to Munich at cruise levels up to FL370 and landed safely on Munich's runway 08L about 8.5 hours later. The aircraft received substantial structural damage.The aircraft was removed from service after landing, the aircraft received substantial structural damage. Following initial repairs the aircraft was ferried from Munich to Hamburg Fuhlsbüttel (Germany) as flight LH-9926 on Mar 16th reaching a maximum cruise level of 080.Germany's BFU confirmed they have been informed about the occurrence, an investigation has been opened, further details are not yet to be disclosed however.On Mar 12th 2013 the French BEA reported the aircraft suffered a tail strike on takeoff, Germany's BFU is investigating the occurrence initially assessed as a serious incident.In May 2013 the BFU reported in their monthly bulletin, that the investigation has been delegated to the BFU by the NTSB, the occurrence was rated an accident.The BFU reported that the first officer (39, ATPL, 9,332 hours total, 5,431 hours on type) was pilot flying during the departure, the captain (57, ATPL, 17,693 hours total, 2,729 hours on type) was pilot monitoring, when the aircraft departed runway 32R and the tail contacted the runway surface. A flight attendant reported unusual noise from the tail shortly after departure, the third pilot in the cockpit (36, ATPL, 8,697 hours total, 4,186 hours on type) received the information. After consultation amongst the crew and with dispatch it was decided to continue the flight to Munich, the cockpit crew had not noticed anything unusual during departure.The aircraft received substantial damage, besides visible abrasion damage to the skin there were deformations of four support beams carrying the floor of the aft cargo bay, a number of the joints between inner structure and skin were severed.On Dec 15th 2016 the BFU released their final report concluding the probable cause of the tail strike was:The BFU is of the opinion that the tailstrike was caused by a reduction of tail clearance due to the following factors:- Flaps configuration- Rotation rate dynamic- Position of centre of gravity and pitch trim- Reduced rebound of the main landing gear shock absorbersIt is to be pointed out that the concurrence of these factors resulted in the tailstrike. The complete system would have tolerated each individual factor by itself.The BFU reported according to FDR the maximum rate of rotation was 4.2 degrees/s, while the usual rate would be 2-3 degrees/s, the rotation began at the computed Vr of 150 KIAS. The pitch angle increased to 11.5 degrees nose up, a peak of +1.18G was recorded, the pitch angle reduced a bit and the pitch rate slowed to 2.8 degrees/s. About one second later at 164 KIAS the main gear departed the runway surface at a pitch angle of 13.5 degrees nose up.The BFU reported that the computer takeoff mass was 227 tons, with the CG at 22.87% MAC (permitted range 18 to 39%), the flight data recorder showed the gross takeoff mass was 225,435kg just prior to takeoff with the CG at 23.4% and trim position at 6.1 degrees nose up (permitted range 0-7 degrees).The crew had chosen to select the flaps to 1+F considering that the snow slush and ice could raise their flaps, while the takeoff performance software recommended F2 position for the flaps for takeoff. The risk of a tailstrike decreases with a higher flap setting, the BFU annotated.Following the flight, on Mar 6th 2013, the shock absorbers were checked and found to extend 237mm on the left hand gear strut and 240mm on the right hand gear strut, required however were 305mm plus/minus 15mm (290-320mm). The shock absorbers were refilled with Nitrogen and then extended 305mm on the left and 307mm on the right gear strut.The BFU reported the aircraft manufacturer analysed the wind data recorded by the FDR and found, that at the time of rotation the aircraft was exposed to a downdraft gradient of 6 knots in 2.5 seconds and a tail wind gradient of 6 knots in 5 seconds. The manufacturer wrote: "The upshot of the wind estimation is a lift reduction during rotation.".The BFU analysed:The damages on the tail section of the airplane could be associated to the tailstrike. The area of the pressurised cabin was damaged but not degraded in its stability. There was no pressure loss during the flight. After the landing the airplane was visually inspected and the extent of the damages determined. The manufacturer confirmed the damages and only agreed to the ferry flight with unpressurised cabin and minimal crew after makeshift repairs of the fuselage. Due to the severity of the damages the occurrence was classified as accident.This tailstrike accident occurred about one second prior to the main landing gear lifting off completely from the runway and the air-ground-switch being triggered. The ground impact was very brief and like a strike. The energy of the strike was transported by struts and cross beams to the cabin floor of the aft galley where the flight attendants were seated.Due to the airplanes length the cockpit was far away from the place of ground contact. Therefore the cockpit crew could not determine the tailstrike. ......The BFU does understand why the flight crew decided to use a lower configuration thus avoiding that the extended lift surfaces were hit by runway contamination. Due to weather and runway conditions it was highly likely that the lift surfaces and engines of the airplane would be hit by snow slush....Both shock absorbers lacked gas and gas pressure so that the required rebound was not met. This resulted in decreased tail clearance.Metars:KORD 060551Z COR 34013KT 10SM BKN012 OVC025 M01/M03 A2995 RMK AO2 SNE19 SLP150 4/010 P0000 60012 T10111033 10000 21011 400061017 51021 $KORD 060451Z 35014KT 6SM -SN BR OVC012 M01/M03 A2994 RMK AO2 SNB02 SLP145 P0000 T10111028 $ KORD 060427Z 36012KT 2SM -SN BLSN BR OVC012 M01/M02 A2993 RMK AO2 SNB02 P0000 $KORD 060351Z 35014KT 6SM BLSN BR BKN012 OVC018 00/M02 A2991 RMK AO2 SNE34 SLP136 P0001 T00001022 $ KORD 060323Z 01016G21KT 5SM -SN BLSN BR BKN012 OVC021 00/M02 A2990 RMK AO2 P0001 $KORD 060251Z 01012KT 1 1/2SM -SN BLSN BR BKN011 OVC021 M01/M02 A2989 RMK AO2 SLP129 P0001 60011 T10061017 53016 $ KORD 060229Z 02013G20KT 1 3/4SM -SN BR BKN011 OVC021 M01/M02 A2989 RMK AO2 P0001 $KORD 060203Z 02015G25KT 1SM R14R/P6000FT -SN BLSN BR SCT009 BKN013 OVC021 M01/M02 A2987 RMK AO2 P0000 $KORD 060203Z COR 02015G25KT 1SM R14R/P6000FT -SN BLSN BR BKN011 OVC021 M01/M02 A2987 RMK AO2 P0000 $KORD 060151Z 02011G18KT 1SM R14R/P6000FT -SN BLSN BR BKN009 OVC014 M01/M02 A2987 RMK AO2 SLP122 P0006 T10111017 $ KORD 060111Z 02013KT 1SM R14R/P6000FT -SN BR BKN009 OVC014 M01/M02 A2986 RMK AO2 P0002 $KORD 060051Z 02011KT 3/4SM R14R/5000VP6000FT -SN BR BKN007 OVC011 M01/M02 A2986 RMK AO2 SLP118 SNINCR 1/10 P0004 T10111022 $KORD 052351Z 03011KT 1/2SM R14R/5000VP6000FT SN FZFG OVC007 M02/M02 A2984 RMK AO2 SLP113 SNINCR 1/9 4/009 P0005 60036 T10171022 11006 21017 53018 $ KORD 052251Z 04011KT 1/2SM R14R/2600V3000FT SN FZFG OVC007 M02/M02 A2982 RMK AO2 SLP104 SNINCR 1/8 P0006 T10171022 $The underside of the tail section, towards nose to the right (Photo: BFU):
A Lufthansa Airbus A320-200, registration D-AIZO performing flight LH-1403 from Prague (Czech Republic) to Frankfurt/Main (Germany), was accelerating for takeoff from runway 24 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed reporting a bird strike on the left hand engine (CFM56). The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron, the crew advised they weren't sure whether the engine had received damage however recommended a runway inspection.A passenger reported about 20 seconds into the takeoff run a loud bang was heard, the aircraft slowed rapidly. The aircraft subsequently taxied to a remote stand. About two hours later the aircraft was able to depart.The occurrence aircraft departed 115 minutes after rejecting takeoff and reached Frankfurt with a delay of 105 minutes. In Frankfurt the aircraft remained on the ground for 4 hours, then returned to service.
A Condor Boeing 767-300, registration D-ABUL performing flight DE-2291 from Cape Town (South Africa) to Frankfurt/Main (Germany), was accelerating for takeoff from Cape Town's runway 19 when the crew rejected takeoff (at about 110 knots over ground) due to a bird strike into the right hand engine (CF6). The aircraft slowed safely, vacated the runway at the last turn off and stopped clear of the runway for an examination by emergency service. The right hand brakes overheated causing the tyres to deflate. Emergency services cooled the brakes.A passenger reported the aircraft accelerated through a flock of birds when an engine ingested birds and failed, the crew rejected takeoff.

A Cobham Aviation Boeing 717-200 on behalf of Qantas, registration VH-YQV performing flight QF-1514 from Canberra,AC to Sydney,NS (Australia) with 91 passengers and 5 crew, was preparing for departure. The captain computed takeoff performance and prepared the FMS for a flex takeoff based on an assumed outside temperature of 40 degrees C resulting in a flex takeoff EPR of 1.38. Upon cross checks the first officer computed the temperature at 39 degrees, the temperature was changed to 39 degrees and entered into the flight management system. Subsequently an amended load sheet was delivered to the cockpit indicating that 22 more passengers than previously anticipated were on board, the crew recomputed the takeoff performance and concluded that the assumed outside temperature had to be changed to 34 degrees C resulting in an EPR of 1.41. At that time the ACARS receiver activated delivering the updated load sheet, a cabin crew member entered the cockpit to confirm the head count and ground personnel operating the wheel chocks called the cockpit. As result the new assumed outside temperature was not entered into the flight management system. The aircraft taxied to the departure runway, the engines were accelerated to about 1.2 EPR, then TOGA activated. The first officer noticed that the engines stabilized at 1.38 EPR instead of the expected 1.41 EPR, moved the power levers to achieve 1.41 EPR, however, the autothrust system returned the thrust levers to 1.38 EPR about 4 seconds after the first officer's intervention. Only during initial climb the first officer spotted that the FMS still showed an assumed temperature of 39 degrees instead of the 34 degrees last computed. The flight continued to Sydney, only after landing the flight crew discussed the event.Australia's ATSB released their final report releasing following safety message:Inaccurate take-off reference data has potentially serious consequences. ATSB Aviation Research and Analysis Report AR-2009-052 (Take-off performance calculation and entry errors: A global perspective) documents a number of accidents and incidents where take-off performance data was inaccurate. The report analyses those accidents and incidents, and concludes: it is imperative that the aviation industry continues to explore solutions to firstly minimise the opportunities for take-off performance parameter errors from occurring and secondly, maximise the chance that any errors that do occur are detected and/or do not lead to negative consequences.The ATSB SafetyWatch highlights the broad safety concerns that come out of our investigation findings and from the occurrence data reported to us by industry. One of the safety concerns relates to data input errors.

A Lufthansa Airbus A321-200, registration D-AISF performing flight LH-356 from Frankfurt/Main to Bremen (Germany), was accelerating for takeoff from Frankfurt's runway 07C when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed, slowed the aircraft safely coming to a stop about 1600 meters/5250 feet before the runway end about abeam taxiway L9.The aircraft, that had taxied out for first departure with a delay of about one hour, was able to depart about 25 minutes later and reached Bremen with a total delay of 90 minutes.A passenger reported the captain announced that a taxiing aircraft had started to cross their runway in front of them, and annotated: "Da sind sich zwei Fluglotsen nicht einig gewesen!" (two air traffic controllers were in disagreement)Prior to contacting Germany's BFU and Germany's DFS The Aviation Herald therefore analysed radar data and found, that a Lufthansa Airbus A320-200 registration D-AINC performing flight LH-23 from Hamburg to Frankfurt, had landed on runway 07R, joined the taxiway between runways 07C and 07R to the end then turned towards the apron on taxiway S East (crossing the extended center line of runway 07C past the end of paved surface, however, still with hold short lines and related signalling), appeared to cross the hold short line south of the extended runway center line just prior to D-AISF rejecting takeoff and appearing north of the extended center line of the runway near the northern hold short line just when D-AISF came to a stop.The BFU told The Aviation Herald however, that according to their information the takeoff was not rejected because of a conflict on taxiway S-East, but because an aircraft on approach to the parallel runway 07R initiated a late go around. The occurrence therefore was neither rated accident nor serious incident and is therefore not being investigated by the BFU.Following the response by the BFU The Aviation Herald went over the radar data again and found, that following D-AINC a Turkish Airlines Airbus A330-200 registration TC-JNC was on final approach to Frankfurt's runway 07R but went around from below 100 feet AGL, that timing coincides with the rejected takeoff of D-AISF, too. TC-JNC positioned for another approach to runway 07R and landed safely about 18 minutes after the go-around.Germany's DFS (Deutsche Flugsicherung, Air Traffic Control Provider Germany) told The Aviation Herald in the afternoon of Sep 12th 2016 after release of initial coverage, that the tower controller instructed LH-356 to reject takeoff after TK-1593 went around reasoning that the effects of the go around like wake turbulence and separation were unclear. LH-23 did not play any role in that consideration, the position of the aircraft was not known to the spokeswoman of DFS. The DFS is going to look into the path of LH-23 now and is going to report back.On Sep 13th 2016 DFS followed up reporting, that they have checked the path of LH-23 on their own (ground) radar systems, the aircraft stopped at the southern hold short line and crossed the hold short line on the eastern taxiway only after LH-356 had already rejected takeoff.Metars:EDDF 311750Z 21003KT CAVOK 24/11 Q1019 NOSIGEDDF 311720Z 21004KT CAVOK 27/11 Q1019 NOSIGEDDF 311650Z 19004KT 140V220 CAVOK 27/11 Q1019 NOSIGEDDF 311620Z VRB03KT CAVOK 28/10 Q1019 NOSIGEDDF 311550Z VRB04KT CAVOK 28/09 Q1019 NOSIGEDDF 311520Z VRB03KT CAVOK 29/10 Q1019 NOSIGEDDF 311450Z VRB04KT CAVOK 28/09 Q1019 NOSIGEDDF 311420Z VRB04KT CAVOK 28/09 Q1019 NOSIGEDDF 311350Z VRB04KT CAVOK 28/11 Q1019 NOSIGEDDF 311320Z VRB04KT CAVOK 28/10 Q1020 NOSIGEDDF 311250Z 12006KT 030V190 CAVOK 27/10 Q1020 NOSIGExcerpt of EDDF Aerodrome Chart (Graphics: AIP Germany):
A Royal Air Maroc Boeing 737-700, registration CN-RNV performing flight AT-811 from Frankfurt/Main (Germany) to Casablanca (Morocco), was accelerating for takeoff from Frankfurt's runway 18 (length 4000 meters, 13,120 feet) when the crew rotated at too low a speed but controlled the pitch to avoid a tail strike. The aircraft finally lifted off a bit and settled back on the runway, became airborne for a larger hop in ground effect but unable to climb out and de-rotated settling down onto the runway again before the aircraft became airborne for a normal climb out. The aircraft continued to Casablanca for a safe landing.At this time it remains unknown why the aircraft rotated early before sufficient airspeed was achieved to sustain a climb out of ground effect, an erroneous computation of takeoff performance (V speeds) as well as a premature takeoff rotation appear possible amongst other options.The video (below) became viral all over the Internet. In response Royal Air Maroc tweeted a French statement in 5 parts translated by The Aviation Herald: "Following dissemination of false information about flight AT-811 of July 23rd, Frankfurt - Casablanca, we wish to clarify that Frankfurt tower advised the captain of our flight in question of possible wake turbulence as result of a simultaneous landing of an A330. As result the captain performed a maneouver to accelerate in order to achieve speeds which permitted safe takeoff."According to video and radar data a Turkish Airlines Airbus A330-300, registration TC-JNI performing flight TK-1593 from Istanbul (Turkey) to Frankfurt (Germany), touched down on Frankfurt's runway 07R about one minute prior to the Royal Air Maroc Boeing 737-700 commencing takeoff. The final approach path to runway 07R crosses runway 18 about 960 meters/3150 feet from the runway 18 threshold (from where the 737 began takeoff roll) and about 770 meters/2500 feet from the usual takeoff position.On Aug 30th 2016 the BFU responded to an inquiry by The Aviation Herald of Aug 25th 2016 stating, the BFU had neither received any notification by the crew, airline or airport involved nor by the person taking the video (see below) and became aware of the occurrence only through the release of the video into the public more than a months after the occurrence. The BFU argued that as result it will not be possible to establish sufficient facts and evidence needed for a detailed investigation, hence the BFU decided to refrain from initiating an investigation.On Sep 5th 2016 The Aviation Herald received a series of high resolution photographs from ground observer Fitz-James showing the slats were clearly extended and the first rotation took place well past the extended center line of runway 07R, during first takeoff rotation there was a slight tailwind of less than 6 knots (according to a windsock visible).The takeoff hops, takeoff run starts 23 seconds into video (Video: bristolcardifairport):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kle80KB_s3IPhoto series (Photos: Fitz-James):Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):

A Thomas Cook Airlines Airbus A320-200, registration OO-TCW performing flight HQ-1513 from Heraklion (Greece) to Brussels (Belgium) with 180 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Heraklion's runway 27 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed due to smoke in the cabin. The aircraft slowed safely and came to a stop about 600 meters/2000 feet down the runway. The aircraft subsequently vacated the runway and taxied to a nearby remote stand, where the passengers disembarked normally via stairs.The passengers there was yellow smoke coming from the right hand engine (CFM56) and an incredible heat developed in the cabin just as the engines spooled up for achieving takeoff thrust, the passengers believed the engine was on fire. Shortly afterwards the brakes came on abruptly. The captain instructed to keep the aircraft doors closed in order to avoid smoke entering the cabin and shut down ventilation and lights.The airline stated there was no fire and no risk for the passengers. There had been an oil leak prompting the crew to reject takeoff. The passengers were taken to hotels. The fauly oil pump is being repaired, the aircraft is estimated to depart in the afternoon/evening of Aug 30th 2016.Passenger video (Video: Christos Kintis):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu7yeIWUsq8Aircraft at the stand during disembarkation (Photo: Karlien Van Steenbrugge):

A Krasavia Let L-410, flight KI-48 from Sushenskoye [UNAU] to Krasnojarsk (Russia) with 13 passengers, had lined up the departure runway and was cleared for takeoff when the crew aborted departure preparations prior to commencing takeoff due to the aircraft steering left instead of straight ahead as commanded by the crew. The aircraft stopped and was shut down on the runway.The aircraft was towed off the runway, the flight was cancelled, Yenisei's Transport Prosecution Office reported. The passengers were bussed to Krasnojarsk.
An Etihad Airways Airbus A330-200, registration A6-EYE performing flight EY-45 from Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates) to Dublin (Ireland) with 216 passengers and 13 crew, was accelerating for takeoff on runway 31L in low visibility conditions with the runway visual range (RVR) reported between 150 and 200 meters (490-660 feet), when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed due to burst nose wheel tyres as result of impact with runway edge lights and stopped. The aircraft was towed to the apron.The runway needed to be closed for 5:50 hours until the debris from 11 runway edge lights and burst tyres was removed and the runway lights were repaired. Airport operation basically came to a halt for about 4 hours because operation on the northern runway 31R requires 550 meters RVR.The aircraft reached Dublin with a delay of 12.5 hours.The airport confirmed an incident involving an Etihad aircraft, which closed runway 31L due to damaged runway edge lights, at 03:19L (23:19Z Jan 29th).On Mar 19th 2012 the United Arab Emirates' General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) released their preliminary report stating the aircraft had been cleared to line up on runway 31L in low visibility and darkness, the crew was following the yellow taxi line normally illuminated by about 30 green taxi center line lights along the 222 meters past the red stop bar. The crew however reported they could not see those green lights after the stop bar. After following the yellow line for about 157 meters the crew turned left off the taxi line and actually aligned with the left hand runway edge lights instead of the runway center line lights. Shortly after the takeoff run was initiated, the nose gear went over 11 runway edge lights with the left main gear about 4.9 meters to the left of the left runway edge, the crew felt the resulting bumps were more intense and the time interval unfamiliar and rejected takeoff for that reason. The aircraft reached a maximum speed of 83 knots and came to a stop on the left runway edge line.After holding there for about 2 minutes the crew taxied the aircraft onto the runway center line in order to vacate the runway however received an ECAM message "TIRE LO PR" due to the left hand nose wheel being punctured as result of impact with the runway edge lights. The aircraft stopped on the runway center line, the crew requested being towed to the apron.11 runway edge lights were destroyed due to impact with the nose gear of the aircraft.The left hand nose wheel tyre was punctured, seven main wheels were found with glass pieces embedded in the wheels requiring replacement of the wheels. The right hand nose wheel was also replaced due to the load as result of impact with the edge lights.The crew comprised the captain (38, ATPL, 9,663 hours total experience, 4,408 hours on type) and the first officer (47, ATPL, 6,173 hours total, 399 hours on type).On Jul 18th 2016 the GCAA released their final report concluding the probable cause of the incident was:The Air Accident Investigation Sector determines that the cause of aligning the Aircraft with the left hand edge of runway 31L instead of the runway centerline was the loss of situation awareness by the crew. The root cause of the loss of situation awareness was not determined.With respect to the taxi lead in lights the GCAA analysed:The evidence gathered from the Airfield Lighting Control and Monitoring System (ALCMS) history report indicated that the stop bar and sensors at taxiway Echo 15 and runway 31L were functioning and recording between the time the Aircraft crossed the stop bar and the time the Aircraft came to a complete stop after the takeoff was rejected. The report did not include any logs of malfunctions and revealed that all associated lights were functioning normally.However, there was no recording of the actual switch positions, nor which mode the ATCO had used to manage the aerodrome lighting, nor there was a regulatory requirement that this information be recorded. Having a record of the actual switch positions, or the mode selected by the ATCO to operate the stop bar, either manually or automatically, would have assisted the Investigation in verifying the ATCOs actual selections.If an automatic/timed operation was selected, the taxiway green lead-in lights would not remain ON throughout the Aircraft taxiing. As per the automatic/timed operation, when an aircraft passes the second sensor (17/7), the stop bar will automatically come ON and the green taxiway lead-in lights to the runway will go OFF. The lead-in lights on the runway itself remain ON at all times. Such a change of lighting conditions would have been recorded in the ALCMS history report, which was not the case, indicating that there was no change in the lighting system. Therefore, the ATCO had selected the ALCMS to manual mode, in which case the taxiway lead-in lights remained ON as the Aircraft taxied onto the runway.The GCAA analysed with respect to the sequence of events in the cockpit:After the Aircraft passed the stop bar, and based on the Aircrafts average speed, the Investigation calculated that at approximately 70m, after crossing the stop bar, the Commander said that He could not see. The Investigation believes that when the Commander expressed that, he was, most likely, referring to the green taxiway lead-in lights and other lights in the vicinity. At that time, he had, most likely, lost external visual cues that could have assisted him in taxiing the Aircraft into the correct take-off position. The Investigation could not determine why the crew could not see the external visual cues.At the same time, the Commander asked the copilot to request the tower ATCO to switch on the runway lights. Immediately after, the tower ATCO called to provide the take-off clearance. The copilot read back the clearance, but he did not request the ATCO to turn ON the runway lights, and the Commander did not repeat his request. The Investigation believes that when this happened the two pilots, most likely, saw an external reference, which was the first light of the left hand runway edge lights. Probably, both of them believed that this was the runway centerline and followed it. That is why there was no challenge of each others decision The Commander continued to taxi and turned the Aircraft to the left of the taxiway centerline and followed the runway left hand edge lights. It is most likely that he believed that following the only visible light was the safest option, not knowing that the Aircraft was away from the actual runway centerline.When the Aircraft lined up, the copilot stated that The centerline lights supposed to have more space than that [silence of two seconds] No? and the Commander explicitly commented on the number of lights visible as being two. The Commander said: I see only two lights., but neither of the other pilots who were in the cockpit effectively challenged their statements to confirm whether they were at their intended position. They could have verified their position by comparing the location of identifiable features to the best of their ability. Identifiable means would had been other lights left and right and runway markings in the Aircraft vicinity.There was a significant difference in the spacing between the runway edge lights, which are 60 m apart, and the spacing between the runway centerline lights which were 15 m apart.In the case of the runway centerline lights, with the RVR of 175m and the knowledge of the light spacing, the flight crew should have been able to see about 11 lights. Therefore, applying their knowledge and experience of airfield lighting and markings should have allowed them to confirm the Aircraft position.Two visible lights on the runway centerline equate to a 30 m RVR, because of their 15 m spacing. If the Aircraft had been located over the runway centerline lights this would equate to a 45 m RVR. This was an indication to alert the crew that the RVR was well below the minimum required for departure....Confirmation biases contribute to personal beliefs and can maintain or strengthen beliefs in the face of contrary evidence13. It is the tendency to attend only to evidence that supports the default hypothesis, which is natural but can result in flawed analysis. The Incident flight crewmembers allowed themselves only to take into account the facts that were compatible with what they believed. Therefore, their situational awareness was influenced. Situational awareness involves appreciating what all the crewmembers need to know. To a crewmember, situational awareness is knowing the status of the aircraft in relationship to external cues....The Incident crew regained their situational awareness after the rejected takeoff.After the Aircraft had impacted nine left hand runway edge lights, the Commander rejected the takeoff. The Aircraft continued to impact two additional lights before becoming to a complete stop on the runway edge. The Commanders decision to reject the takeoff was based on the unusual sound and thumps coming from the nose landing gear wheels. The Investigation believes that the thumps were a good triggering event that caused the crew to reject the takeoff. Without the thumps, and if the takeoff had continued, it may have resulted in severe consequences.Metars:OMAA 300600Z 17003KT 140V200 5000 2000NE BR NSC 16/15 Q1020 A3014 BECMG 7000OMAA 300505Z 18003KT 0300 R13R/P2000U R31L/0400N R13L/P2000N R31R/0700V1600U FGBKN005 13/13 Q1020 A3012 BECMG 3000 HZOMAA 300500Z 17003KT 130V190 1500 0600S R13R/P2000D R31L/0550N R13L/P2000N R31R/0600VP2000D BCFG SCT005 13/13 Q1020 A3012 BECMG 3000 HZ OMAA 300439Z 16003KT 1500 0600S R13R/P2000U R31L/0800U R13L/P2000D R31R/P2000U BCFG SCT005 12/12 Q1019 A3011 BECMG 3000 HZOMAA 300400Z 18003KT 0300 R13R/1000N R31L/0175V0325N R13L/0325D R31R/0225N FG BKN005 12/11 Q1019 A3009 BECMG 3000 HZOMAA 300309Z 17002KT 0200 R13R/0175N R31L/0325N R13L/0750V1300U R31R/0225N FG BKN005 12/12 Q1018 A3007 BECMG 3000 HZOMAA 300300Z 16002KT 0500 R13R/P2000N R31L/0450N R13L/0650D R31R/0275N FG FEW005 12/12 Q1018 A3007 BECMG 3000 OMAA 300225Z 17003KT 0500 R13R/P2000U R31L/0325N R13L/0500V1000U R31R/0325N FG FEW005 12/12 Q1018 A3007 NOSIGOMAA 300200Z 14002KT 0200 R13R/0275N R31L/0250N R13L/0350N R31R/0550N FG BKN001 12/12 Q1017 A3005 NOSIG OMAA 300100Z 11003KT 0150 R13R/0175N R31L/0225N R13L/0350N R31R/0275N FG OVC001 13/13 Q1017 A3003 NOSIG OMAA 300000Z 12004KT 0150 R13R/0175N R31L/0200N R13L/0200N R31R/0200N FG BKN001 13/13 Q1016 A3002 NOSIG OMAA 292300Z 13003KT 090V180 0100 R13R/0175V0350N R31L/0150N R13L/0275VP2000U R31R/0450D FG BKN001 13/13 Q1016 A3002 NOSIG OMAA 292200Z 35002KT 0100 R13R/0300N R31L/0150N R13L/0225V0550D R31R/0800U FG FEW008 15/14 Q1016 A3002 NOSIGOMAA 292114Z 35002KT 1000 0400NE R13R/0200V0600D R31L/0450D R13L/P2000N R31R/P2000N BCFG FEW008 16/15 Q1016 A3002 BECMG 0200 FGOMAA 292114Z 35002KT 1000 0400/ R13R/0200V0600D R31L/0450D R13L/P2000N R31R/P2000N BCFG FEW008 16/15 Q1016 A3002 BECMG 0200 FGOMAA 292121Z 34003KT 0200 R13R/0150D R31L/0225D R13L/P2000D R31R/P2000N FG SCT005 16/15 Q1016 A3002 NOSIGOMAA 292100Z 32003KT 2500 1000NE R13R/0250D R31L/1700U R13L/P2000N R31R/0250D BR FEW008 17/15 Q1017 A3003 TEMPO 1000Relevant NOTAM:A0031/12 - REF UAE AIP OMAA AD 2.20.1.5 MNM RVR REQUIRED TO READ 550M INSTEAD OF 50M.

An Aer Caribe Antonov AN-26, registration HK4728 performing a charter flight from San Jose del Guaviare to Mitu (Colombia) with 13 passengers, 3 crew and 3797kg of freight, was accelerating for takeoff from San Jose del Gua's runway 01 when the aircraft developed vibrations and a tendency to the left. Suspecting a problem with the nose gear the commander eased pressure on the nose gear which sharply stopped the vibrations, the commander decided to reject takeoff close to V1. The engines were brought to idle, brakes were applied and the commander steered the aircraft back onto the center line when the commander called out "BRAKES" just as the aircraft veered sharply to the right, did not respond to pedal and nose wheel inputs and went off the runway about 1153 meters from the runway threshold. While running over soft ground the right hand propeller collided with the automated weather station and a guard booth before the aircraft came to a stop at position N2.5850 W72.6384 312 meters past the point of leaving the runway. Colombia's Grupo de Investigacion de Accidentes & Incidentes Aereos (GRIAA) tweeted the accident occured at SKSJ (San Jose del Gua) on "07/06/2014" at 15:14Z (20:14L), an investigation has been opened.No weather data are available. The Aviation Herald came across the tweet during research of information describing an accident of HK4728 this week (second week of July 2014) and identified the date as Jul 6th, not 7th of Jun due to both date notations mm/dd/yyyy and dd/mm/yyyy widely used thus led to believe both photos released by GRIAA concerned the same occurrence until a reader made us aware of the error. We apologize for the error now corrected.San Jose del Guaviare (San Jose del Gua) features a runway 01/19 of 1500 meters/4920 feet length. Colmbia's GRIAA released their final report in Spanish concluding the probable causes of the serious incident were:- Tyre #2 (inboard left main) burst- Delayed decision to reject takeoff due to an unidentified vibration of the aircraft caused by the burst tyre- Improper handling of emergency brakes by a crew member, not qualified to operate as a flight engineer, which caused the loss of directional control and the runway excursion- Loss of control over ground- Runway excursionThe aircraft received damage to the right hand side of the fuselage, the right hand propeller including the fracture of the axle, engine nacelle, right main gear and left inboard main wheel. The automated weather station as well as the security guard booth at the aerodrome were damaged by impact by the right hand propeller, the equipment of the weather station was destroyed.The commander (57, ATPL, 8,490 hours total, 5,422 hours on type) was assisted by a first officer (23, CPL, 419 hours total, 227 hours on type). An unlicensed board technician occupied the flight engineer's seat.The GRIAA analysed that the technician in the flight engineer's seat had asymmetrically pulled the emergency brakes handles disabling the brakes pedals for both pilots causing the loss of directional control, that the pilots until that point had regained by applying asymmetric brakes pressure correcting the aircraft's position from close to the left edge of the runway back onto the runway center line.The GRIAA analysed that the #2 tyre burst when the aircraft was below 100kph and had travelled 638 meters/2090 feet. Takeoff was rejected at a speed above 100kph when the aircraft had travelled 963 meters/3160 feet, the aircraft went off the runway 1153 meters/3780 feet past the runway threshold at a speed of 106kph/57 knots. The flight data recorder registered +1.76G when the right hand propeller collided with the antenna mast of the weather station. The aircraft came to a stop 1456 meters past the runway threshold.The weather, light drizzle, contributed to the runway excursion by decreasing the friction while on wet grass.The GRIAA analysed that the location of the emergency brakes handles at the aft end of the center pedestal made it difficult for either pilot to operate the handles.The GRIAA analysed that the onboard technician occupying the flight engineer's seat had not been licensed to operate as a flight engineer. However, according to the Technical Manual of the aircraft only 5 hours of flight in normal operations were required to obtain the qualification to operate as a flight engineer. However, the fact that the technician operated the emergency brakes without being qualified to do so has to be rated a "routine violation" because this type of operation was permitted by the airline without assessment of the suitability of such operation.Metars:SKSJ 071700Z 00000KT 7000 DZ BKN015 OVC040 XX/XX AXXXX APCLOSKSJ 071600Z 00000KT 6000 RA BKN015 OVC030 XX/X AXXXX APCLOSKSJ 071500Z VRB00KT 6000 HZ SKT005 OVC015 24/23 A2994SKSJ 071400Z 05003KT 6000 HZ OVC010 24/22 A2993 RMK/AD OPER IMCThe emergency brakes handles (Photo: GRIAA):Ground tracks, weather station antenna and guard booth (Photo: GRIAA):HK4728 off the runway (Photo: GRIAA):Ground trajectory (Graphics: GRIAA):Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):

The aircraft vacated the runway and stopped for an inspection by emergency services. Emergency services did not find any trace of fire, heat or soot. The aircraft returned to the apron.A ground observer listening on frequency reported the aircraft was handed off to a discrete frequency for inspection by emergency services, the crew reported on that frequency that a passenger had observed a 10 feet long flame from the left hand engine.A replacement Boeing 737-800 registration N902NN reached Phoenix with a delay of 2 hours.About 11 hours after rejecting takeoff the occurrence aircraft is currently taxiing to depart for a positioning flight AA-9667 from Santa Ana to Dallas Ft. Worth,TX (USA).
On Apr 7th 2016 the Canadian TSB released their final report concluding the probable causes of the accident were:Findings as to causes and contributing factorsThe number 3 tire ruptured on takeoff, most likely as a result of impact with a hard object.During landing, the failed number 3 tire was spun by contact with the ground and was maintained at a rotational speed that was the same as or very close to one of the natural frequencies of the main landing gear. This caused the lock links to trigger the proximity sensor electronic unit to de-energize the solenoid sequence valve, thereby relieving system pressure from the extend port of the unlock actuator.The excessive vibration caused the lock links to overcome the force from the downlock springs and unlock the stabilizer brace as a result of gear dynamics, which led to collapse of the right main landing gear.Findings as to riskIf there are no specific requirements for dynamic vibration testing of components or completed airframes, there is a risk that similar or other aircraft systems could fail during high-vibration conditions.Other findingsShort-radius turns with hard braking may cause an extreme shearing force on the tread area and on the sidewalls of the number 3 tire in particular, because it is the pivot point.The TSB reported that during the takeoff run from Calgary a noticable vibration occurred as the aircraft approached Vr, the vibration ceased after becoming airborne. After the gear was retracted and the aircraft established in the climb the flight crew began to discuss the vibrations, cabin crew informed the flight crew that the #3 tyre (inboard right hand) had blown and something had impacted the aft fuselage.The crew consulted with company dispatch and maintenance, a return to Calgary was ruled out because of cross winds. It was decided to divert to Edmonton for a landing on runway 02. On approach the gear indicated down and locked. 2.4 seconds after touchdown, the nose gear was still airborne, a pronounced vibration started as the main wheels spun up, and the right main landing gear collapsed, the right hand propeller struck the runway surface with all propeller blades sheared. One large section of a propeller blade penetrated the passenger cabin near seat row 7. At the same time the propeller blades made contact with the runway surface the nose gear touched down hard, both nose tyres blew, the aircraft veered to the right and came to a stop at the right runway edge 3200 feet past the point of first touchdown.The flight data recorder revealed that the aircraft touched down at 118 KCAS with a vertical acceleration of +1.05G, a full weight on wheels indication occurred 1.5 seconds later at 114 KIAS at +1.07G, the throttles were pulled below flight idle and the propellers entered beta range. 2.3 seconds after the full weight on wheels (WOW) indication the aircraft rolled to the right consistent with the collapse of the right main gear at about 105 KCAS, a +2.68G vertical acceleration was recorded as the aircraft rolled right and contacted ground.Three passengers received minor injuries, mainly blunt-force injuries, abrasions and small puncture consistent with plastics pieces of the cabin (side wall, window) blowing into the seat area as result of the propeller blade impact.The TSB reported following safety actions were taken by Jazz and other operators:Immediately after the accident, management of Jazz Aviation decided to mitigate any possible future damage from MLG tires and no longer use retreaded tires on the MLG of its DHC-8-Q400 fleet, effective 10 November 2014.Jazz Aviation has made changes to its DHC-8-Q400 Line Indoctrination Guide  Pilot Line Indoctrination, items 14 and 30, to avoid the use of braking and tire pivot whenever possible. The company has also made changes to volume 2 of its aircraft operating manual and issued a memo (Q400 Memo 2014-131) that addresses Q400 gate arrival and departure taxi techniques, in order to lessen stresses on the main landing gear tires.Other operators that use this aircraft have changed operational procedures to mitigate effect of the sharp right turns on the ramps near the gates in order to lessen the extreme shear loads primarily affecting the number 3 tires.Aerial view (Photo: TSB):Map (Graphics: TSB):
An Air Corsica Airbus A320-200, registration F-HBSA performing flight XK-803 from Rome Fiumicino (Italy) to Ajaccio (France), was accelerating for takeoff from Fiumicino's runway 25 when the crew heard a loud bang from the right hand side of the aircraft and received an "ENG 2 FAIL" ECAM message. The crew rejected takeoff at low speed, about 25 KIAS applying reverse thrust and left hand brakes, as a precaution the right hand engine's (CFM56) firehandle was pulled. Emergency services responded and checked the engine, the aircraft subsequently taxied to the apron with the fire engines in trail.The French BEA reported based on ANSV information, that a post occurrence investigtion revealed substantial damage of the low pressure turbine blades and metallic debris in the engine outlet. Italy's ANSV rated the occurrence a serious incident and opened an investigation.
A Martinair McDonnell Douglas MD-11, registration PH-MCW performing freight flight MP-1156 from Aguadilla (Puerto Rico) to London Stansted,EN (UK), was accelerating for takeoff from Aguadilla when a fire in the left hand engine (PW4462) prompted the crew to reject takeoff at low speed (17 knots over ground). Emergency services responded.The FAA reported on takeoff roll the #1 engine caught fire, the takeoff was rejected. The aircraft subsequently taxied back to the apron, the engine received unknown damage.On Dec 20th 2013 the NTSB reported that the #1 engine suffered an uncontained low pressure turbine failure. Takeoff was rejected at 17 knots, airport emergency services responded but observed no fire. The aircraft taxied back to the apron under own power. The engine received multiple holes through the left and right hand side of the engine aft core cowl, there were numerous small punctures and impact marks on wing and gear. Initial inspection showed the PW4462-3 engine suffered a "partial LPT-to-turbine exhaust case (TEC) flange separation". The engine has been removed from the aircraft and sent for further analysis. On Apr 4th 2016 the NTSB released their final report concluding the probable causes of the incident were:an insufficiently robust flange attachment hardware design, which failed to contain engine components that were liberated during an LPT mechanical failure, resulting in engine/nacelle uncontainment. A factor in the incident was the lack of a module-level LPT inspection and the lack of an inspection requirement to detect/monitor the LPT S4 for advanced sulfidation attack.The NTSB reported that an engine examination showed that the P-flange attachment hardware was missing from 62 of 132 bolt holes, the local case was distorted and the P-flange separated by up to 2 inches. Debris recovered consisted of 71 pieces that were identified as bolt segments of 36 bolts.Upstream of LPT stage 4 there were no faults and damage. Examination of stage 4 revealed an advanced corrosion attack at S4 vanes with all S4 blades fractured close to the platform. All S5 and S6 blades showed near platform separations. 4 S4 vane clusters and more than half of the vane clusters S5 and S6 were liberated. The NTSB wrote: "Metallurgical examination of four exemplar S4 vane clusters found significant corrosion/oxidation consumption of vane airfoil wall thicknesses. Chemical analysis of the corrosion attack fronts revealed sulfur-rich particles, indicative of sulfidation as the corrosion mechanism. EDS and WDS spectra and elemental maps collected at multiple locations along the attack fronts confirmed a consistent sulfur presence and the presence of chromium. Inspection of the displaced S4 vane clusters found that corrosion-induced material loss resulting in loss of structural stiffness had allowed the clusters to disengage at the inner attachment. Four exemplar S4 blade fracture surfaces displayed machining-type LE damage typical of rotor contact with static hardware during operation. Metallurgical examination of the fracture surfaces immediately aft of the consumed LEs revealed high cycle fatigue crack propagation leading to airfoil overload fracture."The NTSB anntotated: "The S4 LPT vane clusters installed in the LPT (P/N 51N674-01) were affected by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airworthiness directive (AD) 2012-14-09, however the engine was within the specified compliance."View of the LPT (Photo: NTSB):Inboard Thrust Reverser Door (Photo: NTSB):Outboard Thrust Reverser Door (Photo: NTSB):

The Committee has opened an investigation to determine the causes of the false line up.The aircraft was able to depart for flight U6-22 with a delay of about 10.5 hours.Metars:UWOO 110700Z 06007MPS 8000 -FZRA OVC024 M02/M06 Q1022 R08/730132 NOSIG RMK QFE755/1007 UWOO 110630Z 06005MPS 9000 -FZRA OVC031 M03/M06 Q1022 R08/730132 NOSIG RMK QFE756/1008 UWOO 110600Z 07006MPS 9000 -FZRA OVC020 M03/M06 Q1022 R08/730132 NOSIG RMK QFE756/1008 UWOO 110530Z 07006MPS 9000 -FZRA OVC024 M03/M06 Q1022 R08/790128 NOSIG RMK QFE756/1008 UWOO 110500Z 10006MPS 9000 -FZRA OVC025 M03/M07 Q1022 R08/790128 NOSIG RMK QFE756/1008 UWOO 110430Z 08006MPS 9999 OVC032 M03/M08 Q1022 R08/790128 NOSIG RMK QFE756/1008UWOO 110400Z 08007MPS 9999 OVC033 M04/M08 Q1023 R08/790130 NOSIG RMK QFE756/1009UWOO 110330Z 09006MPS 9999 OVC039 M03/M10 Q1023 R08/790130 NOSIG RMK QFE756/1008UWOO 110300Z 07006MPS 9999 OVC028 M03/M08 Q1023 R08/790130 NOSIG RMK QFE756/1008UWOO 110230Z 08006MPS 9999 OVC040 M03/M08 Q1023 R08/790133 NOSIG RMK QFE756/1009UWOO 110200Z 09007MPS 7000 -FZRA OVC030 M03/M07 Q1023 R08/790133 NOSIG RMK QFE756/1009 The ground tracks (Photos: Ural Transport Investigation Committee):
An Air Transat Airbus A310-300, registration C-GSAT performing flight TS-262 from Edmonton,AB (Canada) to Puerto Vallarta (Mexico) with 253 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Edmonton's runway 02 when the crew received a right hand thrust reverser unlocked indication (engine CF6) at about 80 KIAS and rejected takeoff. The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway onto taxiway B2. Emergency services responded and found no visible anomaly. The aircraft subsequently taxied to the apron.The aircraft was able to depart about 90 minutes later and reached Mexico with a delay of one hour.
An Allegiant McDonnell Douglas MD-88, registration N403NV performing flight G4-891 from Fort Wayne,IN to Saint Petersburg,FL (USA) with 153 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Fort Wayne's runway 14 when a loud thud was heard from the right hand engine (JT8D). The crew rejected takeoff at high speed, slowed the aircraft safely and after inspection by emergency services returned to the apron.A replacement MD-88 registration N404NV reached Saint Petersburg with a delay of 7.5 hours.A passenger reported a loud thud was heard about half way down the runway almost immediately followed by the brakes coming on and a brief appearance of smoke in the cabin.The airline reported a mechanical issue and reports of smoke in the cabin.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground about 25 hours after rejecting takeoff.
A LGW Luftfahrtgesellschaft Walter de Havilland Dash 8-400 on behalf of Air Berlin, registration D-ABQG performing flight AB-8201 from Krakow (Poland) to Berlin Tegel (Germany), had lined up for departure from runway 25, received takeoff clearance, spooled the engines up for takeoff with brakes still applied, then the brakes were released and about 2 seconds later the crew rejected takeoff and taxied the aircraft back to the apron. The aircraft was able to depart about 35 minutes later and reached Berlin with a delay of one hour.A passenger reported that the aircraft was delayed due to the need to be de-iced when it taxied onto the runway and came to a full stop. The engines subsequently spooled up with brakes applied, the brakes were released and about 2 seconds later, as felt by the passenger, the brakes came on again and the engines spooled down. The aircraft taxied back to the apron, the first officer made an announcement that a "small problem" had occurred. The aircraft was connected to ground power on the stand and the flight attendants served water, then the captain announced that there had been a "major technical problem" and asked the passengers to disembark as soon as the busses already ordered would arrive. The busses arrived, however, the passengers were kept on board, the captain announced that the problem likely was resolved by a reset of the bord computers, they would need to taxi to the runway and attempt another takeoff to see what happens, the captain stated "I promise you it will work only in that way". Two passengers decided to disembark upon that announcement, the rest remained on board. Soon after the aircraft departed without further problem.
A Westjet Boeing 737-700, registration C-FIWJ performing flight WS-2253 from Loreto (Mexico) to Calgary,AB (Canada) with 101 people on board, was accelerating through 120 KIAS for takeoff from Loreto's runway 34 when the aircraft encountered a sudden, distinct and uncommanded yaw to the right prompting the crew to reject takeoff. The crew managed to stop the aircraft on the runway, emergency services responded and inspected the aircraft with no anomalies detected.The Canadian TSB reported that there were no abnormal indications in the cockpit, too. The aircraft was towed to the apron, Mexico's DGCA was notified of the occurrence. So far investigations by Mexico's DGCA and the operator have not identified a cause for the uncommanded yaw.Metars:MMLT 242351Z 34012KT 8SM FEW170 BKN240 27/20 A2988 RMK SLP118 8/082 MMLT 242243Z 32010KT 8SM SCT170 BKN240 28/25 A2988 RMK 8/081MMLT 242144Z 32018KT 8SM SCT170 BKN240 28/25 A2988 RMK 8/081MMLT 242051Z 30017KT 8SM SCT170 SCT240 28/17 A2990 RMK SLP125 8/081 MMLT 241940Z 34018KT 8SM BKN240 27/M03 A2994 RMK 8/008 MMLT 241850Z 34018KT 8SM BKN240 26/M06 A2997 RMK 8/008 
A THY Turkish Airlines Boeing 737-800, registration TC-JGG performing flight TK-973 from Ercan (Cyprus) to Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen (Turkey) with 80 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Ercan's runway 11 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 120 knots) due to a bird strike. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.Following checks for possible bird ingestion by the engines the aircraft was released to service again, departed and reached Istanbul with a delay of about 2 hours.
A Goma Air Let L-410, registration 9N-AKZ performing scheduled domestic flight from Kathmandu to Lukla (Nepal) with 9 people on board, was rotating for takeoff from Kathmandu at 08:46L (03:01Z) when birds impacted the aircraft prompting the crew to return to Kathmandu for a safe landing.The airport reported a bird hit one of the wings of the aircraft right at becoming airborne, the wing received damage requiring repairs that will take a number of days.The airline reported that a bird patrol had chased birds off the runway before departure, however, it appears four birds remained on the runway or immediately returned onto the runway. The bird collided with one of the horizontal stabilizers causing damage. Nepal's Civil Aviation Authority was informed, the damage is being repaired and the aircraft is expected to return to service in a few days, possibly even on Mar 3rd.
An Air Wisconsin Canadair CRJ-200 on behalf of American Airlines, registration N423AW performing flight ZW-3803/AA-3803 from Washington National,DC (USA) to Toronto,ON (Canada), departed Ronald Reagan National Airport's runway 01, takeoff clearance included a traffic advisory of a helicopter at 200 feet in the departure path, and was handed off to Potomac Departure, but did not report on Potomac Depature frequency. The aircraft crossed through a no-fly zone near the Capitol prompting authorities to raise their security level. Radio contact with the aircraft was subseqently re-established. The aircraft continued to Toronto for a safe landing on schedule.Washington Capitol Police reported the security level was raised when the aircraft penetrated a no-fly zone ner the Capitol, the Capitol was not put into lockdown however. After radio contact with the crew was re-established the alert was cancelled.The FAA confirmed the incident occurred after the aircraft departed runway 01, radio contact was briefly lost. The occurrence is under investigation.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/AWI3803/history/20160226/1517Z/KDCA/CYYZ
An Allegiant McDonnell Douglas MD-83, registration N405NV performing flight G4-904 from Saint Petersburg,FL to Kansas City,MO (USA), was accelerating for takeoff when the left hand engine (JT8D) emitted a loud bang and streaks of flame prompting the crew to reject takeoff. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.A replacement MD-88 registration N401NV reached Kansas City with a delay 5.5 hours.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Saint Petersburg 25 hours after rejecting takeoff.
A Condor Boeing 767-300, registration D-ABUL performing flight DE-4062 from Frankfurt/Main (Germany) to Halifax,NS (Canada) with 219 passengers and 8 crew, was cleared for takeoff from runway 25C and was accelerating for takeoff.An Air Bridge Cargo Boeing 747-400 freighter, registration VQ-BUU performing flight RU-481 from Moscow Sheremetyevo (Russia) to Frankfurt/Main (Germany), was on final approach to Frankfurt's runway 25L descending through about 500 feet AGL when the crew initiated and reported a go-around.In response tower instructed DE-4062 to stop. The Condor crew rejected takeoff at high speed and stopped the aircraft on the runway, emergency services responded and sprayed the hot brakes.D-ABUL remained on the ground for 14 days following the occurrence.The occurrence became known to The Aviation Herald by a passenger booked on another flight on May 23rd, who had observed that pre-booked seat assignments had been changed and a number of business class passengers had been downgraded. The captain subsequently apologized in an announcement advising that the aircraft with the bigger business class (editorial note: Condor operates three Boeing 767-300s with 30 business class seats, the others with 18 business class seats) had needed to reject takeoff at high speed on ATC instruction the day before, brakes and tyres needed to be replaced, however, maintenance had not released the aircraft to service yet. It further emerged that a "Jumbo" had been involved into the rejected takeoff.Condor reported that flight DE-4062 from Frankfurt to Halifax needed to reject takeoff on instruction by ATC on May 21st 2015, the reason was another aircraft on another runway going around. Due to the heavy braking a thorough examination of the aircraft needed to be carried out. The passengers of flight DE-4062 were taken to hotels and were flown to their destination the following day.Germany's BFU reported they were informed about the occurrence on May 21st 2015 and are in the process of collecting data to decide, whether an investigation into the occurrence will be opened.On Feb 26th 2016 the BFU released their final report stating just the facts and remaining without conclusions.The BFU reported that the departing aircraft had received departure clearance to follow BIBTI 3G departure from runway 25C involving to climb straight out for 5nm then turn northwest.The BFU reported that V1 had been computed at 151 KIAS. After receiving takeoff clearance on runway 25C the aircraft accelerated for 32 seconds, then slowed for 34 seconds, the maximum speed, according to QAR, was 165 KIAS.The BFU reported that 13 seconds after receiving the takeoff clearance the crew of the Boeing 767-300 began their takeoff roll. 46 seconds after receiving the takeoff clearance the controller instructed "Stop immediately, I say again stop immediately", 4 seconds later, according to QAR, the thrust levers were reduced to idle and the wheel brakes activated, another 3 seconds later the crew acknowledged they were aborting takeoff. The aircraft vacated the runway via taxiway L17, 600 meters short of the runway end, and stopped on taxiway L. Emergency services responded, found the brakes were red-hot and the forward tyres of the left main gear deflated, and began cooling the brakes down.The BFU reported the damage: "The operator had inspected the main landing gears and determined damages on all four axes. The melting plug of the front wheels of the left main landing gear had melted. The front wheels of the left main landing gear showed total pressure loss. The brakes of the wheels 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 leaked hydraulic fluid."The BFU reported that shortly after the B763 had begun their takeoff roll, an arriving Boeing 747-400 cleared to land on runway 25L commenced a go-around, the controller responsible for runway 25L issued instruction to follow standard missed approach procedure which involves a turn to the south, then informed the controller responsible for runway 25C.Metars:EDDF 211850Z 03004KT 340V120 CAVOK 16/01 Q1025 NOSIGEDDF 211820Z 34006KT 300V030 CAVOK 16/M00 Q1025 NOSIG EDDF 211750Z VRB06KT CAVOK 17/00 Q1025 NOSIGEDDF 211720Z 32008KT 270V010 CAVOK 17/00 Q1025 NOSIGEDDF 211650Z 31008KT 260V010 CAVOK 17/M00 Q1025 NOSIG EDDF 211620Z 33007KT 280V050 CAVOK 18/M00 Q1025 NOSIG EDDF 211550Z VRB09G26KT CAVOK 17/M00 Q1025 NOSIGEDDF 211520Z 32009KT 280V020 CAVOK 18/01 Q1025 NOSIGEDDF 211450Z 36007KT 290V050 CAVOK 18/00 Q1025 NOSIGEDDF 211420Z 34009KT 270V010 CAVOK 18/M00 Q1025 NOSIG EDDF 211350Z 33012KT 300V360 CAVOK 16/M00 Q1025 NOSIG EDDF 211320Z 33010KT 270V010 CAVOK 17/02 Q1025 NOSIGEDDF 211250Z VRB09KT CAVOK 16/M00 Q1025 NOSIG EDDF 211220Z VRB10G25KT CAVOK 16/00 Q1025 NOSIG The left hand main gear seen on taxiway L (Photo: BFU):
An Alitalia Airbus A319-100, registration EI-IMT performing flight AZ-1364 from Trieste to Rome Fiumicino (Italy), was accelerating for takeoff from Trieste's runway 27 when the crew rejected takeoff after one of the engines (CFM56) ingested a sea gull and emitted three bangs. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.A replacement Airbus A320-200 registration I-BIKC reached Rome with a delay of 4:15 hours.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground 25 hours after the rejected takeoff.
A US Airways Airbus A320-200, registration N113UW performing flight US-1702 from Philadelphia,PA to Fort Lauderdale,FL (USA) with 149 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from runway 27L, rotated, struck its tail onto the runway and was about 20 feet above the runway when the crew rejected takeoff, the aircraft came to a stop off the side of the runway with the nose gear collapsed. The aircraft was evacuated. There were no injuries.The airport reported there were no injuries, all passengers have been bussed to the terminal.On Mar 14th 2014 NTSB spokesman Terry Williams told The Aviation Herald, investigators were on site, they could not confirm or rule out the takeoff was rejected before or after V1, no details about the final position were known and asked for further communication on Monday. So far no reply to the Aviation Herald's follow up has occurred.The French BEA reported in their weekly bulletin released on Mar 18th 2014, that the aircraft was at about 20 feet AGL when the takeoff was rejected. During the rejected takeoff the nose gear collapsed and the aircraft slightly veered off the side of the runway. The passengers were evacuated. Initial examination showed foreign object ingestion into engine #1. On Jul 9th 2014 The Aviation Herald learned that the pilot flying was the first officer. The aircraft suffered a tail strike on rotation for takeoff, the takeoff was subsequently discontinued. The aircraft received damage beyond (economic) repair. On Feb 24th 2016 the NTSB released their factual report stating, the captain rejected takeoff after rotation on Philadelphia's runway 27L. Two passengers received minor injuries, the aircraft sustained substantial damage.The NTSB summarized crew testimonies that the captain (61, ATPL, 23,800 hours total, 7,500 hours on type) was pilot flying, the first officer (62, ATPL, 13,000 hours total, 4,700 hours on type) was pilot monitoring. During cockpit preparation for departure the captain was talking to the flight dispatcher while the first officer loaded the ATC flight plan into the flight management computer (FMC). Both pilots verified the flight plan on the FMC, but neither pilot recognized that runway 27R had been entered as departure runway rather than runway 27L, that had been assigned to the flight. While taxiing out for departure the crew received the final weight and balance data, the resulting takeoff performance data were manually entered into the FMC.When ATC advised the aircraft would be next to depart, the first officer began reading the remainder of the taxi checklist when a flight attendant advised a passenger was in the lavatory, subsequently advising the passenger was on the way back to the seat. The checklist was completed while the captain taxied the aircraft onto runway 27L. While lining up for departure the captain recognized the wrong runway 27R had been entered into the FMC and instructed the first officer to correct the entry. The aircraft came to a full stop on runway 27L while awaiting takeoff clearance. The FMC was reprogrammed to runway 27L a few seconds prior to receiving takeoff clearance.11 seconds after receiving takeoff clearance the thrust levers were moved into the MAX CLIMB detent and nose down inputs were provided by the captain's side stick. The thrust lever was subsequently moved into the FLEX detent, a chime sounded together with an ECAM message that thrust had not been set, the thrust levers were moved to the CL detent for a second and again into the FLEX detent, 3 seconds later the captain announced "They are set."According to the cockpit voice recorder neither pilot called out 80 knots. Both pilots recognized at about the same time, that no V-speeds were displayed on the primary flight displays. When the aircraft accelerated through 86 knots an aural alert "RETARD" sounded. The captain queried "what did you do, you didn't load. We lost everything", while accelerating through 143 KIAS the captain stated "we'll get that straight when we get airborne" and continued takeoff. Accelerating through 152 KIAS the captain initiated rotation, the first officer stated "wh*. I'm sorry", the aircraft reached 6.9 degrees nose up at 164 KIAS and the nose weight on wheel sensors indicated airborne. Over the next 4 seconds, with the nose wheel indicating airborne and the main wheel sensors indicating ground, the captain's side stick was pushed forward (nose down) and back (nose up) two times reaching 16 degrees nose up and 16 degrees nose down maximum inputs, the aircraft's pitch and vertical acceleration followed the pitch inputs. In response to the next nose down input, as vertical acceleration reduced, the thrust levers were reduced and the side stick was again pulled (nose up input). The vertical acceleration decreased, the thrust levers were reduced to idle, 4 seconds after the nose gear indicated airborne the weight on wheel sensor changed to ground again, the pitch reduced to -0.4 degrees, and the vertical acceleration suddenly increased to +3.7G consistent with the gear impacting the runway surface, at the same time the captain's pitch input again reached the maximum of 16 degrees nose up. The side stick input cycled nose down and nose up inputs over 2 seconds again and reached 16 degrees nose up again, nose and main gear sensors indicated airborne and the radio altimeter reached 15 feet AGL, the side stick input went to a nose down input, and the aircraft descended, the stick input changed to nose up again and the aircraft pitched up hitting the runway surface with the tail first, then the main landing gear, the nose rotated down until the nose gear impacted the runway and collapsed. 38 seconds after the nose gear had first indicated airborne the aircraft stopped at the left side of the runway, the crew advised ATC they had rejected takeoff and were evacuating the aircraft.The NTSB described the aircraft damage: "The airplane nose gear collapsed upon impact with the paved runway, resulting in fuselage and engine cowling damage. As a result of the tailstrike, additional damage occurred to the lower aft fuselage section of the airplane, including the aft pressure bulkhead, fuselage, struts, and cross beams. Damage to the left engine occurred after the nose gear collapse due to ingestion of debris. "The NTSB stated that in previous similiar occurrences, when the crew had received "Thrust not set" indications and "RETARD" calls during takeoff acceleration, the assumed temperature had not been set for flex takeoff, however, crews did not advance the thrust levers into the TOGA detent.The NTSB reported that US Airways released a bulletin stating:On September 5, 2014, US Airways published Bulletin 21-14 as a policy change to its A319/320/321 Pilot Handbook. The bulletin stated the following:"RETARD" Auto Callout During TakeoffBackground. Airbus has identified the possibility to erroneously receive the auto callout "RETARD" during takeoff. This callout is generated during takeoff due to the incorrect calculation of flight phase by the Flight Warning Computers. This occurs at and above 80 knots on takeoff when the thrust levers have been placed in the FLX/MCT detent and no FLEX TEMP was entered in the MCDU PERF TO page. However, if the thrust levers are placed in the TO/GA detent prior to reaching 80 knots, the "RETARD" callout does not occur.Procedure. Per current Pilot Handbook procedure, if a FLEX temperature was not entered in the MCDU, and the thrust levers are positioned in the FLEX/MCT detent, an ECAM caution will be generated. In this case, move the thrust levers to TO/GA detent and execute a max thrust takeoff in accordance with ECAM direction. When the thrust levers are moved to the TO/GA detent, the warning will be cancelled. (See Pilot Handbook, 2d.1.2). If the thrust levers are not moved to the TO/GA detent prior to 80 knots, the "RETARD" auto callout will sound. Should this occur, perform a rejected takeoff.The following change to Pilot Handbook 2d.6.4, Rejected Takeoff, Recommended Guidelines, will not be reflected in Revision Cycle 5, but will be included in a subsequent revision:Between 80 Knots and V1. US Airways recommends a rejected takeoff for items such as engine failure, aircraft aural fire warning, predictive windshear warning or caution, the occurrence of the "RETARD" auto callout, or the perception the aircraft is unsafe or unable to fly.On Feb 25th 2016 the NTSB released their final report concluding the probable causes of the accident were:the captain's decision to reject the takeoff after the airplane had rotated. Contributing to the accident was the flight crew's failure to follow standard operating procedures by not verifying that the airplane's flight management computer was properly configured for takeoff and the captain's failure to perform the correct action in response to the electronic centralized aircraft monitoring alert.The NTSB analysed: According to the captain, once the airplane was cleared for takeoff on runway 27L, he set FLEX thrust with the thrust levers, and he felt that the performance and acceleration of the airplane on the takeoff roll was normal. About 2 seconds later, as the airplane reached about 56 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS), cockpit voice recorder (CVR) data indicate that the flight crew received a single level two caution chime and an electronic centralized aircraft monitoring (ECAM) message indicating that the thrust was not set correctly. The first officer called "engine thrust levers not set." According to the operator's pilot handbook, in response to an "engine thrust levers not set" ECAM message, the thrust levers should be moved to the takeoff/go-around (TO/GA) detent.However, the captain responded by saying "they're set" and moving the thrust levers from the FLEX position to the CL (climb) detent then back to the FLEX position. As the airplane continued to accelerate, the first officer did not make a callout at 80 KIAS, as required by the operator's standard operating procedures (SOPs). As the airplane reached 86 KIAS, the automated RETARD aural alert sounded and continued until the end of the CVR recording. According to Airbus, the RETARD alert is designed to occur at 20 ft radio altitude on landing and advise the pilot to reduce the thrust levers to idle. The captain later reported that he had never heard an aural RETARD alert on takeoff, only knew of it on landing, and did not know what it was telling him. He further said that when the RETARD aural alert sounded, he did not plan to reject the takeoff because they were in a high-speed regime, they had no red warning lights, and there was nothing to suggest that the takeoff should be rejected. The first officer later reported that there were no V-speeds depicted on the PFD and, thus, she could not call V1 or VR during the takeoff. She was not aware of any guidance or procedure that recommended rejecting or continuing a takeoff when there were no V-speeds displayed. She further said she "assumed [the captain] wouldn't continue to takeoff if he did not know the V-speeds." The captain stated that he had recalled the V-speeds as previously briefed from the Taxi checklist, which happened to be the same V-speeds for runway 27L. The captain continued the takeoff roll despite the lack of displayed V-speeds, no callouts from the first officer, and the continued and repeated RETARD aural alert. FDR data show that the airplane rotated at 164 KIAS. However, in a postaccident interview, the captain stated that he "had the perception the aircraft was unsafe to fly" and that he decided "the safest action was not to continue," so he commenced a rejected takeoff. FDR data indicate that the captain reduced the engines to idle and made an airplane-nose-down input as the airplane reached 167 KIAS (well above the V1 speed of 157 KIAS) and achieved a 6.7 degree nose-high attitude. The airplane's pitch decreased until the nosegear contacted the runway. However, the airplane then bounced back into the air and achieved a radio altitude of about 15 ft. Video from airport security cameras show the airplane fully above the runway surface after the bounce. The tail of the airplane then struck the runway surface, followed by the main landing gear then the nose landing gear, resulting in its fracture. The airplane slid to its final resting position on the left side of runway 27L.The operator's SOPs address the conditions under which a rejected takeoff should be performed within both low-speed (below 80 KIAS) and high-speed (between 80 KIAS and V1) regimes but provide no guidance for rejecting a takeoff after V1 and rotation. Simulator testing performed after the accident demonstrated that increasing the thrust levers to the TO/GA detent, as required by SOPs upon the activation of the "thrust not set" ECAM message, would have silenced the RETARD aural alert. At the time of the accident, neither the operator's training program nor manuals provided to flight crews specifically addressed what to do in the event the RETARD alert occurred during takeoff; although, 9 months before the accident, US Airways published a safety article regarding the conditions under which the alert would activate during takeoff. The operator's postaccident actions include a policy change (published via bulletin) to its pilot handbook specifying that moving the thrust levers to the TO/GA detent will cancel the RETARD aural alert.Although simulator testing indicated that the airplane was capable of sustaining flight after liftoff, it is likely that the cascading alerts (the ECAM message and the RETARD alert) and the lack of V-speed callouts eventually led the captain to have a heightened concern for the airplane's state as rotation occurred. FDR data indicate that the captain made erratic pitch inputs after the initial rotation, leading to the nose impacting the runway and the airplane bouncing into the air after the throttle levers had been returned to idle. Airbus simulation of the accident airplane's acceleration, rotation, and pitch response to the cyclic longitudinal inputs demonstrated that the airplane was responding as expected to the control inputs.Collectively, the events before rotation (the incorrect runway programmed in the FMC, the "thrust not set" ECAM message during the takeoff roll, the RETARD alert, and the lack of required V-speeds callouts) should have prompted the flight crew not to proceed with the takeoff roll. The flight crewmembers exhibited a self-induced pressure to continue the takeoff rather than taking the time to ensure the airplane was properly configured. Further, the captain initiated a rejected takeoff after the airplane's speed was beyond V1 and the nosewheel was off the runway when he should have been committed to the takeoff. The flight crewmembers' performance was indicative of poor crew resource management in that they failed to assess their situation when an error was discovered, to request a delayed takeoff, to communicate effectively, and to follow SOPs. Specifically, the captain's decision to abort the takeoff after rotation, the flight crew's failure to verify the correct departure runway before gate departure, and the captain's failure to move the thrust levers to the TO/GA detent in response to the ECAM message were all contrary to the operator's SOPs.The NTSB annotated that there was a partly dissenting/concurring opinion supported by 4 members of the board reading:Generally, I agree with the report and probable cause determination of Notation 8736. This investigation ultimately reveals a crew that made decisions which resulted in minor injuries to passengers and substantial damage to what was otherwise a perfectly sound aircraft. While I concur that probable cause of this rejected takeoff of US Airways Flight 1702 was the captain's decision "to reject the takeoff after the airplane had rotated" and the flight crew's "failure to follow standard operating procedures," I believe that a critical piece of the puzzle remains inadequately examined. During the moments leading up to the rejected takeoff, the crew repeatedly heard an aural RETARD alert. There is no dispute that the crew did not understand what the alert, in those circumstance, was intended to convey. Moreover, the insistent nature of the alert affected the crew and drew their attention during this critical decision-making period. The first officer, in interviews, stated that once the RETARD aural alert began she did not "call any V-speeds" during the takeoff because the crew was "distracted with the aural RETARD alert." Further, the co-pilot reported thinking that she had just wanted the aural RETARD alert "to shut up."Based on crew interviews and NTSB simulations, there is every indication that the airplane would have been capable of continued flight. Therefore, had the pilot continued after take-off, he essentially would have been able to recover from the initial deviations from SOPs. It remains unclear why the pilot became convinced that an otherwise sound airplane was not safe to fly. The co -pilot recalled her perception that the RETARD alert was very loud and seemed to become more rapid as the plane accelerated. The RETARD alert was not only a distraction to the crew at this crucial moment, it encouraged the crew to take the incorrect action during takeoff. The extent of the RETARD alert's impact on the crew's decision making is unclear, but it obviously was forefront in their minds. We have underemphasized the impact of the RETARD alert on the crew actions. It is my belief that the RETARD alert contributed to the pilot's decision to reject the take-off after the airplane had rotated and that the alert should be considered a contributing factor to the probable cause. This inclusion should not and does not diminish the fact that the primary probable cause remains the pilot's failure to follow his training and continue with the take-off, nor should it be interpreted to reduce the impact of the other contributing factor, the crew's failure to follow standard SOPs.Metars:KPHL 140054Z 30016G25KT 10SM CLR M01/M22 A3006 RMK AO2 PK WND 29026/0001 SLP177 T10061217=KPHL 132354Z 29016G22KT 10SM CLR M01/M21 A3002 RMK AO2 PK WND 29027/2311 SLP164 T10061211 10006 21011 53045=KPHL 132254Z 30012G19KT 10SM CLR 00/M21 A2997 RMK AO2 PK WND 29032/2205 SLP147 T00001206=KPHL 132154Z 29018G28KT 10SM CLR 00/M21 A2992 RMK AO2 PK WND 30033/2113 SLP130 T00001206=KPHL 132054Z 30021G34KT 10SM FEW075 00/M20 A2988 RMK AO2 PK WND 30034/2048 SLP118 T00001200 53024=KPHL 131954Z 29018G27KT 10SM FEW070 01/M19 A2985 RMK AO2 PK WND 31037/1940 SLP108 T00061194=KPHL 131854Z 28020G32KT 10SM FEW065 M01/M19 A2983 RMK AO2 PK WND 28035/1837 SLP099 T10061189=View from nose towards tail:A look into the nose gear bay:Left engine inlet:Left engine fan damage:Left engine cowling damage:The aircraft sitting on the apron awaiting ultimate decision about its fate:The aircraft off the runway during evacuation (Photo: Portman Travel):
A Tuifly Boeing 737-800, registration D-ATUD performing flight X3-1333 from Salzburg (Austria) to Hanover (Germany), was accelerating for takeoff from Salzburg's runway 15 when the crew rejected takeoff just about at the 80 knots call due to an abnormal slat indication. The aircraft slowed safely, stopped briefly on the turn off (with the controller requesting the crew to move a bit forward to get clear of the runway with another aircraft on short final to runway 15) and decided to return to the apron.The aircraft remained on the ground for about 4.5 hours while the problem was rectified, then departed for the flight and reached Hanover with a delay of 4:20 hours.

An Easyjet Airbus A320-200, registration G-EZUH performing flight U2-2029 from London Luton,EN (UK) to Montpellier (France) with 178 passengers and 6 crew, was prepared for departure from Luton's runway 08. The commander intended to use full runway length (2162 meters of takeoff run/accelerate stop distance available), use flaps 1, the takeoff performance was computed, cross checked by the first officer and entered into the flight management and guidance system (FMGS). The aircraft subsequently taxied to the holding point for runway 08, another aircraft was waiting for departure from full distance runway 08, and tower advised the crew that they had difficulties obtaining their clearance from the next sector. The captain offered to use an intersection departure from taxiway B1 (takeoff run available/accelerate stop distance of 1,688 meters) to resolve the issue, tower confirmed this would solve the problem, and the crew decided to use B1 for line up. The captain decided to use flaps 2 for takeoff, the takeoff performance was recalculated for flaps 2, with emphasis on flaps 2, and full runway length, the computation was cross checked by the first officer and entered into the FMGS. During the subsequent takeoff run the commander noticed that the remaining runway was shorter than expected, the aircraft became airborne 180 meters before the runway end. The crew discussed the takeoff performance later into the flight and discovered that the performance data had been incorrectly computed. The aircraft landed safely and without further incident in Montpellier.The United Kingdom's AAIB released their bulletin (page 81) reporting the captain (41, ATPL, 6,995 hours total, 4,841 hours on type) later commented that he was using his electronic flight bag (EFB) to compute takeoff performances. After the decision to use line up at B1 he intended to change the runway length accordingly on his EFB, however, it was likely runway 08 full length remained selected due to finger size and/or the laptop's screen calibration. The captain also believed he was distracted from cross checking the correct runway length had been selected due to the need to confirm the change of flap setting with the first officer.The AAIB reported that the aircraft became airborne 180 meters before the runway end and crossed the runway threshold at a height of 117 feet measured by the radio altimeter.The AAIB reported following immediate safety actions were taken by the operator: As a result of this and other recent incidents the operator will publish an article in the next edition of its Flight Safety Bulletin outlining their severity and the hazards of not crosschecking all performance calculations.Also, the operator has added a briefing note on all of its Operational Flight Plans highlighting the importance of crosschecking takeoff performance calculations when changes are made as a result of intersection departures or other last‑minute changes to aircraft configuration or takeoff distances.

An El Al Boeing 737-800, registration 4X-EKA performing flight LY-253 from Tel Aviv (Israel) to Munich (Germany) with 75 passengers and 8 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport's runway 08. Just as takeoff power was set a vibration was felt throughout the aircraft, the aircraft began to veer right and a loud bang occurred. The flight crew rejected takeoff at low speed reporting the right hand engine (CFM56) had failed. The crew secured the right hand engine, verified that no other damage had occurred and taxied the aircraft to the apron. An examination of the engine revealed metallic fragments in the engine exhaust nozzle suggesting disintegration of the turbine assembly. A runway inspection was initiated by the crew, however, no debris was found on the runway.Israel's AIAI released their final report in Hebrew into the serious incident issuing following findings:- The sudden technical failure occurred without any prior indications- The right hand engine failed with both high pressure turbine (HPT) and low pressure turbine (LPT) disintegrating as soon as take-off power was applied. The failure was contained, with no other damage, and consequently no requirement for the fire engine- The examination by SR Technic Zurich (SRT) revealed cracks in blades installed during the last overhaul and which were most probably the cause of the engine failure- A Borescope inspection, which Boeing requires every 1,600 cycles, was carried out 722 flight hours prior to the failure- The engine failure and shutdown occurred at the beginning of the take-off run. The aircraft is capable of completing its take-off on just one engine (editorial question: even at low speed before sufficient rudder authority has been achieved?)- From analysis of the recordings and pilot's debriefing, there were no prior indications before the engine failure- All actions by the crew were efficient and with accordance with requisite procedures- The crew's reports were incomplete and resulted in discrepancies between the data available to the company and airport authorities respectively- The tower's handling of traffic, both on the ground and in the air, was correct and efficient- The assessment of the situation by the various authorities concerned was uncoordinated, resulting in some confusion during the taxiing back- Runway examination for FOD was carried out correctly- Definitions of some terms used in English and Hebrew during emergency procedures are not adequate or sufficiently clear- The reports by the airport authorities were issued only after the event and those by the company somewhat late- An objective investigation should be conducted by an independent body under supervision of the chief investigator or his representative. In this case, the investigation was carried out by SRT and Chromalloy- The engine manufacturer, CFM, does not recognize Chromalloy as a repair facility, even though it has FAA certification - The last repair of these blades, carried out by Chromalloy Nevada, included removal of the coating. However, examination of the damaged blades did not show any signs of reapplication of coating, which would have clearly revealed any cracking The AIAI reported that the AIAI was notified of the occurrence 40 minutes after the rejected takeoff and immediately dispatched investigators to Ben Gurion Airport to secure the flight data and cockpit voice recorders as well as supervise the removal of the engine from the aircraft and initiate the examination of the engine.In general the AIAI hwoever complained about the disorganized organisation by the operator in conveying pertinent information to the investigation.The engine had been built in 1999 and underwent overhaul in April 2009. The engine had accumulated 43,086 flight hours in 12,952 flight cycles since new and 13,626 flight hours in 3,880 flight cycles since overhaul.Inspection of the right hand engine revealed that the high pressure rotor could be turned freely, the low pressure rotor however had seized. The low and high pressure compressor as well as the combustion chamber were found undamaged, all blades of the high pressure turbine except for the blade roots were missing, all stages of the low pressure turbine showed substantial damage, the magnetic chip detector did not contain any metallic particles.The AIAI reported that it was impossible to determine the actual cause of the engine failure without detailed investigation and complained that this investigation was carried out by SR Technic in Zurich, who had last overhauled the engine.The AIAI summarized the investigation report by SRT: The engine failure was caused by a single forceful event, no evidence of fatigue was found.The AIAI annotated that the report was sent in part to the engine manufacturer who responded that the treatment of the turbine blades had not been in line with the procedures required by the engine manufacturer. Chromalloy Nevada, who had carried out the blade overhaul, had not been approved by CFM. The procedure used by Chromalloy is not recognized by CFM. The AIAI analysed that it was quite normal in the aviation world to use "DER repairs" (Designated Engineer Representative repairs), that permit repairs even by facilities not authorized by the component manufacturer as long as at least one employee of that facility has been certified by the FAA and is a Designated Engineer Representative. El Al as result of the investiation have ceased to involve DER repairs and now send all blades to CFM for repairs/overhaul including all blades that have been treated by Chromalloy.The AIAI analysed that cracks, that most probably developed a long time prior to the actual engine failure, had not been detected by borescopic inspections. The AIAI therefore wrote, that borescopic examinations have a low reliability to detect blade cracks.The AIAI heavily criticized the crew resource management following the occurrence reasoning that each of the three pilots on the flightdeck, one captain (55, ATPL, 30,000+ hours total, 22,000+ hours in command) in the left hand seat, a first officer (47, ATPL, 8,500 hours total, 3,500 hours on type) and second captain (no data provided) on the observer's seat, had a different recollection of the occurrence signifying that there had been insufficient communication on the flight deck to develop a common understanding of what had happened. In addition, the communication between crew, tower, dispatch and company maintenance was inadequate for a speedy and efficient dealing with the resulting situation.One safety recommendation was issued to the operator to introduce a centralized professional body to ensure coordination and dissemination of all relevant information to all relevant authorities. Three safety recommendations were issued to the Israeli Authorities at the airport and Civil Aviation Authority to review safety and crisis management at Ben Gurion Airport, review the procedures at SRT and review communication problems that arose despite standard phraseology used, that however was without precise definition.The high pressure turbine damage (Photo: AIAI):The low pressure turbine damage (Photo: AIAI):
A Compass Airlines Embraer ERJ-175 on behalf of Delta Airlines, registration N638CZ performing flight CP-5700/DL-5700 from Los Angeles,CA to Kansas City,MO (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Los Angeles' runway 25R when about 31 seconds after the takeoff clearance the controller with heightened voice instructed "Cancel Takeoff Clearance, Hold Position". The crew rejected takeoff at high speed and vacated the runway about 2100 meters/6900 feet down the runway and stopped on the turn off. Tower explained that a vehicle had entered the runway, they didn't know who he was and were working to ensure that he wouldn't do it again.The Airport reported an Airport employee had mistakenly turned onto the runway from a taxiway. He had not been certified to drive near the runway, his license to drive airside was rescinded.The FAA opened an investigation.The ERJ-175 was able to depart about 40 minutes later and reached Kansas City with a delay of 30 minutes.
An Allegiant McDonnell Douglas MD-82, registration N408NV performing flight G4-516 from Las Vegas,NV to Fresno,CA (USA) with 159 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Las Vegas' runway 19L when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed and slowed the aircraft advising ATC that no assistance was needed. The crew was instructed to turn left onto taxiway A (near the end of the runway) or left at the end of the runway (onto taxiway D). While taxiing towards the terminal the aircraft stopped, emergency services responded and while approaching the aircraft began to spray the aircraft with water. The passengers disembarked the aircraft via the rear stairs.Passengers reported the aircraft was accelerating shortly prior to rotation when a boom was heard from the engines and the brakes came on. The flight crew instructed them to remain seated, everything was okay even when the fire engines already began to spray water onto the aircraft. After disembarking through the rear exit it appeared the left hand main tyres were flat.Emergency services reported that a small right hand engine fire was observed when the trucks neared the aircraft. The airline confirmed a mechanical issue during the takeoff roll, the crew rejected takeoff and taxied the aircraft to a remote pad where the aircraft was met by emergency services.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Las Vegas about 28 hours after the rejected takeoff.
An Alitalia Airbus A321-200, registration EI-IXH performing flight AZ-809 from Tel Aviv (Israel) to Rome Fiumicino (Italy), was accelerating for takeoff from Ben Gurion Airport's runway 26 when the left hand engine (CFM56) ingested two birds prompting the crew to reject takeoff at low speed. The aircraft stopped about 900 meters down the runway, emergency services responded and checked the aircraft. The aircraft was subsequently towed back to the apron.The aircraft is still on the ground in Tel Aviv 16 hours after the takeoff was rejected.
A Delta Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-90, registration N944DN performing flight DL-702 from Denver,CO to Atlanta,GA (USA) with 161 passengers, was accelerating for takeoff from runway 34L when the next departure Southwest Airlines flight WN-1267 to Minneapolis,MN (USA) called there was smoke from the landing gear, in immediate response the Delta crew called they were rejecting takeoff. The takeoff was rejected at low speed, tower reported seeing black smoke that turned white as the aircraft stopped. Emergency services responded, the next departures were redirected to runway 34R. The Southwest crew reported they were seeing the smoke from the right hand landing gear. The crew indicated they have had a dragging brake on the right gear, they were ready for an evacuation should it become necessary. Emergency services on reaching the aircraft - emergency services were having problems reaching the runway due to runway 34R busy with arrivals - reported that it appeared there was hydraulic fluid dripping onto the right hand brakes, brakes temperature was 280 degrees C, no evacuation was needed. The passengers disembarked normally onto the runway and were bussed to the terminal, the aircraft was towed to the apron.A replacement MD-90 registration N941DN reached Atlanta with a delay of 6:45 hours.
An ANA All Nippon Airways Airbus A320-200, registration JA8947 performing flight NH-773 from Osaka Itami to Sapporo (Japan) with 149 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Itami Airport's runway 32L when the right hand engine (CFM56) emitted a loud bang and streaks of flame prompting the crew to reject takeoff at low speed (approximately 70 knots). The aircraft slowed safely, emergency services responded.The runway was closed for about two hours to remove engine debris left behind as result of the engine failure. Japan's Ministry of Transport confirmed the right hand engine suffered a failure and ejected parts onto the runway. The runway resumed service about two hours later.A replacement A320-200 registration JA8654 reached Sapporo with a delay of 4 hours.
A TUIFly Boeing 737-700 in Air Berlin Colours and on behalf of Air Berlin, registration D-AHXF performing flight AB-6110 from Munich to Cologne (Germany), was accelerating for takeoff from runway 26R when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed due to a right hand engine (CFM56) problem. The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway on a high speed turn off about 1650 meters down the runway.A passenger reported that sparks were seen from the right hand engine, at almost the same time the brakes came on. After the aircraft stopped to have the engine inspected the crew announced, that there was currently no abnormal indication in the cockpit, in coordination with technical staff in Hamburg they would return to the gate for safety reasons. Repairs were obviously carried out, parts were brought to the aircraft, the departure was postponed for about 5.5 hours, then the flight was cancelled.The flight was cancelled, the passengers were rebooked onto other flights.
An Aurigny Air Services Embraer ERJ-195, registration G-NSEY performing flight GR-604 from Guernsey,CI to London Gatwick,EN (UK), was accelerating for takeoff from Guernsey's runway 09 when a bird was ingested into the left hand engine (CF34) prompting the crew to reject takeoff at high speed. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Guernsey.The airline confirmed a bird was ingested by the left hand engine causing damage to fan blades, the repairs might last up to three days.
An Olympic Air de Havilland Dash 8-400 on behalf of Aegean, registration SX-OBA performing flight A3-267 from Lemnos to Athens (Greece), was accelerating for takeoff from Lemnos' runway 22L when a bird impacted the aircraft prompting the crew to reject takeoff and return to the apron.Following checks the aircraft was able to depart and reached Athens with a delay of 90 minutes.Passenger video (Video: tassos76):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lH6Dk6Vr2c
A Cathay Pacific Airbus A340-300, registration B-HXD performing flight CX-198 from Auckland (New Zealand) to Hong Kong (China) with 244 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Auckland's runway 23L when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 90 knots over ground) due to a problem with the #3 engine (CFM56, inboard right hand). The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron. Passengers disembarked while maintenance was carried out and boarded again about 5 hours later, the aircraft accelerated for takeoff from runway 23L a second time when the crew again rejected takeoff at high speed (about 90 knots over ground) due to a problem with the #3 engine. The aircraft returned to the apron.The airline confirmed takeoff was rejected twice due to a problem with the #3 engine. The passengers were rebooked onto other flights or the next day's flight CX-198.
A Cebu Pacific Air Aerospatiale ATR-72, registration RP-C7250 performing flight 5J-893 from Manila to Caticlan (Philippines) with 53 passengers and 5 crew, returned to Manila after the indications for the right hand engine alerted the crew of engine trouble shortly after takeoff. The landing on Manila's runway 06 10 minutes after liftoff was safe.The flight was cancelled, the passengers rebooked onto the next flight.The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) released their executive summary of the final report concluding the probable cause of the incident was:It was determined that the probable cause of the fire was due to fuel nozzle failure.The CAAP reported the aircraft was climbing through 600 feet AGL out of Manila, when the crew received an aircraft performance monitor caution, the captain, pilot flying, instructed the first officer to reset the caution. A short time later the crew received an engine fire indication for the right hand engine, worked the memory items shutting the engine down and discharging the fire suppression, stopped the climb at 3000 feet and joined a downwind for runway 06. While on short final to runway 06, descending through about 500 feet AGL, the fire indication extinguished. The aircraft landed without further incident and taxied to the apron, where the passengers disembarked normally. 
A SAS Scandinavian Airlines Boeing 737-600, registration LN-RPF performing flight SK-1631 from Stockholm (Sweden) to Frankfurt/Main (Germany), was accelerating for takeoff from Stockholm's runway 19R when the crew rejected takeoff at very low speed and returned to the apron.A passenger reported the crew explained they had a flaps indication.A replacement Boeing 737-600 registration LN-RRZ reached Frankfurt with a delay of 100 minutes.
A Lease Fly Avions de Transport Regional ATR-42-300 on behalf of Chalair, registration CS-DTO performing flight CE-72 from Lyon to Limoges (France) with 25 people on board, was preparing for takeoff from Lyon's runway 18R when the aircraft developed an abnormal bank angle and vibrations prompting the crew to not takeoff. One of the main tyres was found fully deflated. The passengers disembarked onto the runway and were bussed to the terminal.The wheel was replaced and the aircraft subsequently towed off the runway.The flight was cancelled.A passenger reported the aircraft was accelerating and rejected takeoff after developing an unusual attitude. They disembarked onto the runway, one tyre was found fully deflated.On Sep 16th 2015 Lease Fly forwarded documentation via their lawyer stating, that the aircraft was taxiing for departure from runway 18R, the crew observed an unusual attitude of their aircraft, left wing low, after turning off taxiway T onto holding point A3, no unusual sounds and no unusual indications, and radioed tower that they needed to return to the gate due to technical problems. Tower instructed them to enter the runway and vacate via the next taxiway, subsequently changed to A2. The aircraft entered the runway and taxied slowly, when the crew indicated they had problems and needed an outside inspection, tower requested to taxi a bit closer to the runway edge. The crew shut down the engines and performed an outside check finding both tyres deflated. The passengers disembarked and were bussed to the terminal, maintenance subsequently replaced wheel #1 and inflated tyre #2 before the aircraft was towed to the apron.The airline forwarded the examination report by the wheel manufacturer (erroneously identifying CS-DVL as occurrence aircraft) reporting that 3 of 10 bolts of wheel #1 were found failed. The report discussed: "All ten bolts were examined and 8 were found stamped FIT (Fastener Innovation Technology of Gardena California), one (Bolt 9) was marked PBF and one (Bolt 5) had a not recognized identification, all were marked MS21250. 6 bolts were found to have signs of pitting in the shank under the cadmium plating (Figure 8)." The manufacturer report concluded: "The fracture surfaces of all 3 bolts show a cup and cone morphology (see Figures 4, 5 and 6). This is typical of tensile overload fracture. The dimensional and hardness results are presented in Tables 1, 2 and 3. All bolts tested had hardness values below specification requirement."The fractured bolts of wheel #1 (Photo: Meggit):Aerodrome Chart (Graphics: Lease Fly/Jeppesen):
A Flybe de Havilland Dash 8-400, registration G-JECM performing flight BE-803 from Newquay,EN to London Gatwick,EN (UK), was accelerating for takeoff from Newquay when a sea gull impacted the aircraft prompting the crew to reject takeoff. The aircraft returned to the apron.A replacement Dash 8-400 registration G-JECO reached Gatwick with a delay of 2 hours.The airline confirmed takeoff was rejected as a precaution following a bird strike.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Newquay 26 hours after rejecting takeoff.
A Brussels Airlines Airbus A320-200, registration OO-SNC performing flight SN-3126 from Bologna (Italy) to Brussels (Belgium), was accelerating for takeoff from Bologna's runway 12 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed after the right hand engine (CFM56) emitted a loud bang. The aircraft slowed safely, vacated the runway about 500 meters/1650 feet down the runway and returned to the apron.The flight was cancelled.A passenger tweeted for help stating his flight of Sep 5th had been cancelled, the rebooked flight SN-3126 was cancelled, too, and the passenger is still in Bologna on Sep 7th.Another passenger reported the captain announced an engine failure.On Sep 12th 2015 The Aviation Herald received information, that the right hand engine stalled while accelerating through about 70% N1. The engine needed to be replaced due to turbine damage. Following the engine change the aircraft ferried back to Brussels on Sep 9th and resumed service on Sep 10th.
A Vueling Airbus A320-200, registration EC-KLT performing flight VY-3865 from Asturias,SP to Palma Mallorca,SP (Spain) with 150 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Asturia/Oviedo Airport's runway 29 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed due to an engine (CFM56) failure. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.A replacement Airbus A320-200 registration EC-LQL reached Palma Mallorca with a delay of 11 hours.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Asturias about 48 hours after the rejected takeoff.
An Onur Air Airbus A320-200, registration TC-OBO performing flight 8Q-372 from Amsterdam (Netherlands) to Istanbul (Turkey), was accelerating for takeoff from Amsterdam's runway 24 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (above 110 knots over ground) subsequently reporting they had a configuration problem.

The aircraft was able to depart about 35 minutes later and reached Istanbul with a delay of 35 minutes.
An Allegiant Boeing 757-200, registration N903NV performing flight G4-453 from Austin,TX to Las Vegas,NV (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Austin's runway 17R when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 110 knots over ground) reporting an engine (RB211) indication as reason for the rejected takeoff. The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway via taxiway T about 2100 meters/6900 feet down the runway. While taxiing for gate #3 the crew declared a medical emergency reporting a female passenger had suffered a panic attack. The aircraft pulled into the gate and was subsequently seen with 7 of 8 main tyres deflated.A replacement McDonnell Douglas MD-83 registration N424NV reached Las Vegas with a delay of 7 hours.
A SATA International Airbus A310-300, registration CS-TKN performing flight S4-320 from Toronto,ON (Canada) to Ponta Delgada (Portugal) with 201 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Toronto's runway 23 about to reach V1 when the crew noticed a strong odour and some visible smoke on the flight deck. The crew continued takeoff but declared emergency after becoming airborne, stopped the climb at 5000 feet and returned to Toronto for a safe landing on runway 23 about 13 minutes after departure.The Canadian TSB reported maintenance found the number 1 pack ACM inoperative due to a failed cooling turbine. The unit was replaced.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/RZO320/history/20150818/0145Z/CYYZ/LPPD
A Lufthansa Boeing 747-400, registration D-ABVS performing flight LH-710 from Frankfurt/Main (Germany) to Tokyo Narita (Japan), was accelerating for takeoff from Frankfurt's runway 07C when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 150 knots over ground). The aircraft slowed safely, vacated the runway and stopped for a check by emergency services.The flight was postponed to the next day. A replacement Boeing 747-400 registration D-ABVR reached Tokyo with a delay of 24 hours.Passengers reported that the aircraft was accelerating already at high speed when the aircraft sharply veered left and right, immediately afterwards the brakes came on. The aircraft slowed and rolled onto a taxiway stopping there for quite a while. The aircraft was subsequently towed for a few hundred meters before coming to a stop again, near an airport fire station and some distance in front of the airport's terminal number 1. The captain announced turbulence off the preceding departure (a Cathay Boeing 777-300 registration B-KPV performing flight CX-288 from Frankfurt to Hong Kong (China)) had caused the aircraft to be thrown left and right and prompted them to reject takeoff. The brakes overheated, the tyres deflated. About one hour after the rejected takeoff the passengers disembarked onto the taxiway.Several observers on the ground watching the aftermath reported D-ABVS was stopped with almost all main tyres deflated on taxiway N4 in the passage between hangars near the airport's fire station and straight in front of terminal 1, emergency services were spraying the wheels. Passengers disembarked onto the taixway and were bussed to the terminal. The aircraft remained in that position for at least 5 hours while the tyres/wheels were being replaced on the taxiway.Metars:EDDF 221350Z 10010KT 060V150 CAVOK 27/03 Q1017 NOSIGEDDF 221320Z 10008KT 040V150 CAVOK 27/03 Q1018 NOSIGEDDF 221250Z 06009KT 340V120 CAVOK 27/04 Q1018 NOSIGEDDF 221220Z 11011KT 070V140 CAVOK 27/06 Q1018 NOSIGEDDF 221150Z 08009KT 040V150 CAVOK 25/06 Q1019 NOSIGEDDF 221120Z 09007KT 020V150 CAVOK 26/06 Q1019 NOSIGEDDF 221050Z 09007KT 040V140 CAVOK 25/06 Q1019 NOSIGEDDF 221020Z 09007KT 060V120 CAVOK 24/08 Q1020 NOSIGEDDF 220950Z 08007KT 020V120 CAVOK 23/09 Q1020 NOSIGExcerpt of aerodrome chart (Graphics: AIP Germany):
A Yeti Airlines Jetstream 41, registration 9N-AJC performing flight YT-894 from Bhairahawa to Kathmandu (Nepal) with 28 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Bhairahawa when the crew decided to reject takeoff at high speed due to a flock of birds on the runway. The aircraft veered off the runway and came to a safe stop off the runway. The passengers disembarked normally.A replacement aircraft has been dispatched to take the passengers to Kathmandu.The airline confirmed the runway excursion onto a grassy field during the rejected takeoff due to a flock of birds on the runway. All occupants are safe. The airline denied reports that the aircraft went off the runway due to a burst tyre as widely reported in Nepalese media or broke through a fence as reported by yellow press in the UK. 9N-AJC after the rejected takeoff (Photo: Chetan Pant):
An Aeromexico Boeing 767-200, registration XA-TOJ performing flight AM-2 from Madrid,SP (Spain) to Mexico City (Mexico) with 153 passengers and 9 crew, was rotating for takeoff from Madrid's runway 36L when the tail of the aircraft contacted the runway surface leaving debris behind. The crew continued the takeoff and climb, levelled off and descended after the oxygen masks were released, then entered a hold to burn off fuel and returned to Madrid for a safe landing about 90 minutes after departure. Two cabin crew received injuries, the aircraft sustained substantial damage.An Air Europa Airbus A330 departing after the Aeromexico received nose gear tyre damage while departing over the debris left by the Boeing and needed to return, too, see Incident: Air Europa A332 at Madrid on Apr 16th 2013, damaged nose gear tyres on takeoff.The airport reported two cabin crew received neck injuries (mainly bruises) from their seat belts as result of impact forces.The airline confirmed the aircraft suffered a tailstrike on takeoff and returned to Madrid for a safe landing. The safety of passengers was not at risk at any time. The airline is cooperating with the investigation authorities.Spain's CIAIAC is investigating the accident and resulting tyre damage incident.An observer on the ground reported that the aircraft was rotating for takeoff about abeam of the fire station about 1900-2000 meters down the runway (runway length 4350 meters), the nose gear and main gear lifted off the runway but the aircraft did not climb, instead the tail contacted the runway for about 4 seconds before the aircraft started slowly to climb. The observer believed to have seen some smoke from the tail while it contacted the runway. Following the event the observer could not see any runway inspection.A passenger reported the takeoff appeared normal initially until the aircraft began to rotate, the nose lifted up, however, nothing happened. The nose dropped again, then rose very sharply perhaps because of the runway end becoming visible. A sound of impact was heard from the back of the cabin followed by scratching sounds, that lasted for about 5 seconds, then the aircraft began to climb. During the initial climb the aircraft was shaking, the right wing dropped which the passenger, frequent traveller, perceived as unusual. The aircraft continued to climb heading north out of the Madrid area, no announcements were made. Passengers in the back of the cabin reacted confused and increasingly alarmed with no announcement made by the crew. Several minutes into the flight the passenger oxygen masks dropped (see photo below) together with the announcement "put on your mask and breath normally", the aircraft obviously stopped the climb and rapidly descended, a short time later an announcement "10,000 feet" was heard, cabin crew announced passengers could not remove their masks, the cockpit announced now they were returning to Madrid but provided no reason. The aircraft landed back in Madrid and taxied straight to the gate, the passengers disembarked normally. The passenger was able to see terrible damage to the tail of the aircraft, the right hand main gear tyres had deflated. The passenger had not seen any damage inside the aircraft. They were offered accomodation over night and were rebooked onto other flights via other European cities connecting to Mexico City the following day.Air Traffic Control reported the aircraft climbed out without any comment, later into the departure climb the crew indicated they had cabin pressure problems and needed to return to Madrid. There was no mention of the possibility of a tail strike and no mention of injuries on board. The tower controller had not been able to see the tail contact the runway surface about 4km from his position, between the Aeromexico and Air Europa there were a few other departures without any problems.On May 3rd 2013 Spain's CIAIAC reported the three flight attendants seated in the rear galley heard strange noises during takeoff. When they proceeded to inform the flight deck about the noises the flight crew already prepared to return to Madrid due to the cabin pressure problems at 14,000 feet. Then the passenger oxygen masks were released. The crew informed ATC about cabin pressure problems 22 minutes after departure. Two of the three cabin crew in the aft galley complained about neck pain. The aircraft received substantial damage to the lower fuselage including the near complete loss of both APU compartment doors. The Air Europa A332 departed 29 minutes after departure of XA-TOJ as 7th aircraft following XA-TOJ. The runway inspection following that departure recovered two metallic pieces of debris from the runway.On Aug 12th 2015 the CIAIAC released their final report in Spanish concluding the probable causes of the accident were:The accident occurred because the aircraft rotated at a much lower speed than necessary. Vr had been computed incorrectly during flight preparation based on the zero fuel weight rather than the takeoff weight. The error was not detected by the crew when the data were inserted into the flight management system. Contributing factors were:- recent introduction of a performance computation system (OPT) in the company- experience of both dispatcher and crew was insufficient in this area- Madrid did not have an OPT system installed yet, hence the data were transmitted in a way, that had not been defined.The CIAIAC reported that the aircraft was preparing for departure when the OPT data were transmitted about 5 minutes prior to departure, however not in the way foreseen but in the way of an e-mail rather than the standardised output of the OPT program, that had been introduced in the company about 6 months prior to the accident. The OPT data would provide all data necessary to be input into the FMS directly. When the e-mail was compiled the main portions of the program output were copied into the text of the e-mail together with the results of the computations. The e-mail was cross checked the supplement first officer (49, ATPL, 13,428 hours total, 278 hours on type), the crew, captain (54, ATPL, 20,066 hours total, 149 hours on type) and first officer (41, ATPL, 11,696 hours total, 147 hours on type), subsequently entered the following data into the FMS: V1: 118 KIASVr: 118 KIASV2: 126 KIASThe aircraft taxied to the departure runway, received takeoff clearance and following the routine call outs 80, V1, rotate the captain, pilot flying, rotated the aircraft, the aircraft however did not become airborne. The commander relaxed pressure on the controls to permit the aircraft accelerate some more, then the aircraft became airborne and climbed out. Surprised by the events the crew checked takeoff configuration but could not find anything out of the ordinary. When the aircraft climbed through 10,000 feet, which marks the end of sterile cockpit requirement, a flight attendant located in the rear of the cabin contacted the cockpit and reported unusual noises and a bump during takeoff. A few moments later the cabin altitude alert activated and the passenger oxygen masks were automatically released. The crew donned their oxygen masks, descended the aircraft to 11,000 feet and removed the oxygen masks. The company approved landing above maximum landing weight, without dumping fuel, and the aircraft landed without further incident on runway 18L. While taxiing towards the apron tower informed the crew that debris off the aircraft was found on the runway. After the aircraft arrived on stand, tyres deflated due to the brakes temperatures triggering the tyre fuses. There were no injuries.The CIAIAC analysed that the correct speeds would have been:V1: 152 KIAS (instead of 118 KIAS)Vr: 156 KIAS (instead of 118 KIAS)V2: 161 KIAS (instead of 126 KIAS)The CIAIAC analysed that OPT data had been computed on the base of the zero fuel weight, however, when the e-mail was compiled, the correct takeoff weight data were inserted and transmitted together with the zero fuel weight performance data making it impossible to the crew to detect the mismatch of data, as the performance data appeared to have been computed for the takeoff weight.As result of the accident the company prohibited transmission of data in any other way but direct output of the OPT program until all stations received the OPT equipment directly.The CIAIAC analysed that upon reaching 118 KIAS, the computed Vr, the rotation began and within 5 seconds reached 8.8 degrees nose up, at that point the indicated airspeed was 134 knots still insufficient to become airborne. A second later the main gear lifted off and reached a maximum height of 4 feet while the pitch increased to 14.1 degrees nose up, the main gear touched down again however causing the tail strike (maximum pitch angle with main gear touched down and oleos not compressed is 13.1 degrees nose up) bringing the pitch down to 13 degrees. The controls were slightly relaxed, the aircraft accelerated to 141 KIAS then the pitch angle was increased again reaching 15 degrees nose up at 142 KIAS, stick shaker activated for two seconds and a second time for two more seconds. The aircraft reached 19 degrees nose up pitch accelerating through 148-150 KIAS at 47 feet AGL, then the backpressure on the controls was relieved some, the aircraft accelerated into normal speed range.The CIAIAC analysed that the crew attempted rotation 32 knots below necessary rotation speed and did not disengage autothrust although required by procedures and did not release the back pressure and lower the nose as necessary to correct. Instead engine power was increased against FCOM recommendation (to prevent further increase of the pitch angle). Considering all the data available, the CIAIAC continued, it can be concluded that the crew failed to recognize the low speed situation and instead increased the pitch to 19 degrees where a maximum of 13.1 degrees was permitted before a tail strike would occur.The CIAIAC analysed that the presence of a tail bumper would not have prevented the damage, but would at least have alerted the crew to the tail strike occurrence. Cabin crew were adament to not violate the company procedures of sterile cockpit up to 10,000 feet, permitting exceptions only for observations that would prevent the safe conduct of the flight. Neither cabin crew thought their observation was indicative of a problem preventing the safe conduct of flight. The general manager of the airline made clear that the possibility of intercom always existed to communicate abnormal situations in the passenger cabin, that could cause an emergency situation. While the master caution activated and 3 seconds later the cabin altitude alert activated, the crew initially levelled off at FL170 to work the checklists but continued the climb to FL190, then advised ATC that they could not maintain this level due to cabin pressure problems and began to descend again, in about that time the passenger oxygen masks deployed. The crew realized the oxygen masks had been released by the illumination of the related cockpit switch and decided to return to Madrid, however, performing a normal descent rather than an emergency descent.The CIAIAC analysed that the crew was not aware of the tail strike and did not detect the possibility of a tail strike, hence air traffic control was never informed about the possibility of debris on the departure runway. The tower controller had observed the aircraft climbing out and did not notice anything out of the ordinary, hence the presence of debris on the runway was not anticipated until another aircraft hit the debris during their departure roll.Metars:LEMD 161500Z 18004G15KT CAVOK 25/07 Q1021 NOSIG LEMD 161430Z 19004G18KT 130V260 CAVOK 25/08 Q1021 NOSIG LEMD 161400Z 23004KT 120V280 CAVOK 25/08 Q1021 NOSIGLEMD 161330Z 19006KT 130V290 CAVOK 25/12 Q1022 NOSIGLEMD 161300Z 21006G18KT CAVOK 24/10 Q1022 NOSIG LEMD 161230Z 21006G17KT 160V280 CAVOK 24/10 Q1022 NOSIG LEMD 161200Z 17005KT CAVOK 23/12 Q1022 NOSIGLEMD 161130Z 18002KT CAVOK 23/09 Q1023 NOSIGLEMD 161100Z 22002KT CAVOK 22/11 Q1023 NOSIGLEMD 161030Z 21001KT CAVOK 21/11 Q1023 NOSIGLEMD 161000Z 19003KT 140V250 CAVOK 19/11 Q1023 NOSIGScenes on board:The damage to XA-TOJ (Photo: Controladores Aereos):
A Delta Airlines Boeing 777-200, registration N707DN performing flight DL-71 from Amsterdam (Netherlands) to Atlanta,GA (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from runway 24 when tower instructed to stop immediately after observing a landing aircraft on runway 18C going around due to an unstable approach. The Delta crew did not understand, tower repeated "Stop immediately" a second time, the crew read back "cleared for takeoff" and finally acknowledged a third "stop immediately". The crew rejected takeoff at high speed, slowed the aircraft safely, reported normal operations and vacated the runway. While taxiing towards the apron emergency services were called to check the brakes after tower observed smoke from the right hand brakes, when emergency services arrived there was still smoke from the right hand brakes, emergency services cooled the brakes. The aircraft subsequently taxied to the apron.The aircraft was able to depart about 80 minutes later and reached Atlanta with a delay of 65 minutes.The departure from/go around on runway 18C intersects with initial departure from runway 24.
A Lufthansa Airbus A340-600, registration D-AIHR performing flight LH-411 from New York JFK,NY (USA) to Munich (Germany), was accelerating for takeoff from New York's runway 13R when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed due to the failure of a computer associated with the engine-fuel supply. The crew advised no assistance was needed, vacated the runway via taxiway PC (editorial note: just coincidence though fitting!) about 370 meters/1200 feet down the runway and returned to the apron. The computers were told manners via the reset button and the aircraft was able to depart about 15 minutes after rejecting takeoff. The aircraft reached Munich about 10 minutes behind schedule.
A Lufthansa Airbus A319-100, registration D-AILT performing flight LH-115 from Munich to Frankfurt/Main (Germany), was accelerating for takeoff from Munich's runway 08L when the crew rejected takeoff at about 80 knots on tower instruction. The aircraft slowed safely, vacated the runway, the crew requested inspection of brakes and gear. Following that inspection the brakes needed to cool before the aircraft taxied to the holding point again and departed about 15 minutes after the rejected takeoff. The aircraft landed safely in Frankfurt with a delay 15 minutes.A passenger reported the captain announced that taxiway A2 was closed due to construction work, on taxiway A3 there was already another aircraft waiting for departure, LH-115 however should depart first and thus was instructed to continue taxi on taxiway N and line up the runway via taxiway A1, while still on taxiway A1 they were cleared for takeoff and commenced a rolling takeoff. Then tower realized that taxiway A1 had been blocked too and instructed them to reject takeoff to have the aircraft inspected, at that time they were already at 80 knots and needed to inspect the brakes and tyres as result, then needed time to permit the brakes cool sufficiently. The passenger annotated that the captain appeared pretty enraged, the captain called the reason for the rejected takeoff "crazy".On Aug 10th 2015, following the release of the first report, an observer on the ground and listener on frequency told The Aviation Herald, that ground control had cleared the aircraft to taxi to holding point A3. The aircraft was just reaching intersection of taxiways N and A3 when the crew of the aircraft waiting at the holding point A3 indicated they were not yet ready for departure. Ground Control therefore instructed the Lufthansa A319 to continue on taxiway N to A1 and, as the aircraft had already started to turn onto A3, mentioned to make a sharp turn to the left to get back onto the taxiway N. The stopbars at taxiway M were illuminated, however, the aircraft taxied to A1 via taxiway M, the intersection of which with A2 was closed due to construction work on A2 too, the intersection was otherwise clear however. Following crossing A2 at M the aircraft joined A1, was cleared for takeoff and after lining up commenced a rolling takeoff. Soon after tower called the aircraft to stop and explained that airport authority had observed the aircraft crossing the closed taxiway A2 and requested the aircraft to be stopped for an inspection by airport authority for possible damage as result of crossing the closed taxiway A2.Related NOTAM (no NOTAM for A1 available):A4355/15 - TWY A2 CLSD. 06 AUG 05:00 2015 UNTIL 15 AUG 09:00 2015 ESTIMATED.

An ABX Air Boeing 767-300, registration N219CY performing freight flight GB-7001 from Los Angeles,CA to Honolulu,HI (USA) with 2 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Los Angeles' runway 25R when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 40 knots) and vacated the runway advising no assistance was needed. While taxiing on the parallel taxiway the crew requested to hold position to talk to maintenance advising they needed to set their parking brake which was the problem causing the rejected takeoff too. About 6 minutes later the crew advised they were ready for another takeoff, taxied the aircraft to the holding point and departed about 8 minutes after aborting takeoff.
An Aeroflot Airbus A321-200, registration VP-BOC performing flight SU-2613 from Milan Malpensa (Italy) to Moscow Sheremetyevo (Russia), was accelerating for takeoff from Malpensa's runway 35L when the crew rejected at high speed due to a malfunction of the captain's side window. The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway onto taxiway P, emergency services responded. All four main tyres deflated in the aftermath disabling the aircraft on taxiway P.The aircraft later (Photos: Malpensa Spotters Group):
A REX Regional Express Saab 340B, registration VH-ZLR performing flight ZL-3653 from Mildura,VI to Melbourne,VI (Australia), was accelerating for takeoff from Mildura when the aircraft collided with a Kangaroo prompting the crew to reject takeoff. The aircraft came to a safe stop but was disabled on the runway. There were no injuries, the aircraft sustained damage.The airline confirmed the aircraft's right hand propeller collided with a kangaroo on takeoff from Mildura still in darkness, the crew rejected takeoff. The aircraft sustained damage which is currently being assessed.Australia's TSB confirmed being informed about the occurrence, however, the occurrence will not be investigated by the ATSB.
An Emirates Boeing 777-200, registration A6-EWC performing flight EK-211 from Dubai (United Arab Emirates) to Houston,TX (USA) with 269 passengers and 18 crew, rejected takeoff from Dubai's runway 12R at high speed. The airplane slowed safely, several main gear tyres deflated.A replacement Boeing 777-200 registration A6-EWH departed Dubai about 8.5 hours later and is currently (Aug 8th 18:20Z) at FL320 overhead Poland estimated to reach Houston with a delay of 7.5 hours.Sources inside Emirates said, that the takeoff was rejected at high speed because of some problem with a nosewheel tyre. A total of twelve tyres needed to be replaced following the rejected takeoff.On Jul 24th 2015 The United Arab Emirates GCAA released their final report concluding the probable cause of the incident was:The Air Accident Investigation Sector (AAIS) determines that the cause of the event is identified to be a tire tread separation of the right hand nose wheel tire.Contributing Factors to the IncidentThe tire had sustained damage due to FOD.The captain (ATPL, 10,802 hours total, 6,366 hours on type) was pilot flying, the first officer (ATPL, 6,851 hours total, 1,736 hours on type) was pilot monitoring, the crew was augmented by another captain (ATPL, 10,689 hours total, 2,658 hours on type) and another first officer (ATPL, 6,655 hours total, 2,167 hours on type). The crew computed the takeoff performance, gross mass was 5,767kg/12,700lbs below maximum takeoff mass, the crew correctly computed V1 at 178 KIAS. The aircraft was accelerating for takeoff on Dubai's runway 12R when at about 170 KIAS a bang was heard and saw tyre debris flying up in front of the aircraft following by serious vibrations from the nose gear. The captain rejected takeoff, the aircraft never exceeded V1, and brought the aircraft to a stop on the center line of the runway with "with ample paved surface remaining". Emergency services responded, the brakes temperatures rose causing the main gear tyres to deflate. The crew started the APU and shut down the engines. Emergency services arrived and cooled the brakes with water. Stairs were brought to the aircraft, the passengers disembarked 25 minutes after the rejected takeoff.The GCAA analysed: "Following an analysis of the right hand nose wheel tire debris, and the tire inspection report, it is evident that there was an imprint of an object that the failed tire had most probably passed over. The presence of this object, which the tire imprint showed did not have sharp edges or corners, was most likely, the initiating cause of the event. The object was not recovered. Therefore, it was not possible to determine where or when the tire ran over the object. But as the failed casing of the tire had marks of heat, one could argue of how many seconds it takes to generate the heat that was caused by the friction of the casing. It is possible that the object was on the taxi route of the aircraft to the runway, or was most probably on the runway itself. Alternatively, the object could have been picked-up by the tire on an earlier occasion. The object caused a deep indentation in the tire and damaged it. This led to the separation of the tire tread during the takeoff roll and the tire pieces were thrown against the underside of the forward fuselage producing a loud banging noise, which was heard in the cockpit. This loud noise created an impression among the pilots that the Aircraft was unable or unsafe to fly. The Commander decided to stop the Aircraft on the runway by executing a high speed RTO."The GCAA concluded analysis: "A tire failure during the take-off roll could lead to an inappropriate decision to reject a take-off. This was not the case in the Incident under investigation. It is generally known that failure of a tire will result in a longer than calculated stopping distance due to the loss of braking force on the associated wheel. But the nose wheel tire, which failed in this case, is not used for braking. However, it has the potential to lead to additional tire failure due to the high energy and the associated temperatures generated during a high speed RTO. During the Incident the other tire remained intact and the actual tire that threw a tread remained inflated. Nevertheless as the tire pieces were separated they were impacting the fuselage and other areas of the Aircraft. The impact created loud noises and bangs. Due to these bangs the Commander was under the impression that the aircraft was unsafe or unable to fly, and he performed the RTO at a speed below V1. After initiating the STOP actions the speed initially continued to increase due to the momentum of the Aircraft .The speed of the Aircraft then started to decrease and the maximum speed recorded was below the V1 speed. The Aircraft stopped 1216 m before end of runway, without any significant damage, other than that described in paragraph 1.4 of this Report."The failed right nose gear tyre, red circles indicate sidewall damage due to foreign object damage (Photo: GCAA):
A KLM Boeing 747-400, registration PH-BFC performing flight KL-887 from Amsterdam (Netherlands) to Hong Kong (China), was accelerating for takeoff on Amsterdam's runway 24 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed bringing the aircraft to a stop about 760 meters/2500 feet short of the runway end (length 3,230 meters/10,600 feet), emergency services responded. The crew reported they had multiple bird strikes and vibrations from one or two engines (CF6). The crew subsequently indicated they were able to vacate the runway, and the aircraft vacated the runway at the last turn off to the right.A replacement Boeing 747-400 registration PH-BFO is estimated to reach Hong Kong with a delay of 4 hours.About 10 minutes prior to the occurrence a bird watch reported the presence of feathers in the vicinity of the runway and advised tower, that there was likely bird activity around the runway, probably crow alikes.
A Wind Rose Aviation Airbus A320-200, registration UR-WRK performing flight 7W-4011 from Kharkov (Ukraine) to Antalya (Turkey), was accelerating for takeoff from Kharkov's runway 25 when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed due to a bird impacting one of the engines (CFM56). The aircraft returned to the apron.The damage was limited to the engine intake, the aircraft was released to the flight, departed about 3 hours later and reached Antalya with a delay of about 3 hours.
A Porter de Havilland Dash 8-400, registration C-GKQB performing flight PD-617 from Toronto City,ON to Timmins,ON (Canada) with 26 people on board, departed Billy Bishop Airport's runway 33 but immediately after takeoff dropped the outboard cowl of the left hand engine (PW150). Some time later ground personnel discovered debris on the runway and contacted tower, the debris was collected and identified as an engine cowl, the airline notified who in turn contacted the flight crew who had remained unaware of the occurrence. The aircraft returned to Toronto's Billy Bishop Airport for a safe landing.The Canadian TSB reported that in addition to the damaged engine cowl the aircraft received damage to leading edge of left wing, upper left wing surface and a window frame. It was determined that the 4 latches, that secure the left forward engine door, had not been fastened.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/POE617/history/20150707/0130Z/CYTZ/CYTS
A Southwest Airlines Boeing 737-700, registration N554WN performing flight WN-3299 from Chicago Midway,IL to Boston,MA (USA) with 143 passengers and 5 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from runway 04R when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed reporting "fire on number 2". The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway to the right onto taxiway K (about 450 meters/1500 feet down the runway) stopping on the intersections of taxiways Y and K, when asked by tower whether they needed assistance, crew replied "stand by", a runway inspection was ordered by tower. The crew advised they had no fire indication, they were running a checklist. Tower advised emergency services that it appeared engine #2 had failed, there were visible sparks from the engine. The runway inspection found debris on the runway, the runway was closed. Emergency services declared the aircraft safe after checks, after emergency services pulled away from the aircraft the aircraft taxied to the apron.A replacement Boeing 737-700 reached Boston with a delay of 2.5 hours.A passenger reported there were a bang, streaks of flame and sparks from the right hand engine while the aircraft accelerated.The right hand engine emitting sparks:
A Brit Air Canadair CRJ-700 on behalf of Air France, registration F-GRZH performing flight DB-5906/AF-5906 from Lyon (France) to Barcelona,SP (Spain), was departing Lyon when two loud bangs were heard from the left hand engine (CF34). The crew continued takeoff, observed no changes in engine parameters however received an engine fire indication, shut the engine down and discharged the fire suppression systems. The aircraft returned to Lyon for a safe landing.The NTSB reported the BEA have initiated an investigation.Another flight experienced a problem out of Lyon the same day, see Incident: Brit Air CRJ1 near Lyon on Aug 16th 2011, smoke in cabin, possible depressurization.On Jun 9th 2015 the French BEA released their final report in French concluding the probable cause of the incident was:The detachment of the fuel pressure line at the operability bleed valve (OBV) from its connector created a fuel leak in the left engine which in contact with hot parts of the engine started a fire.Forces affecting the fuel pressure line have been sufficient to loosen the connector by wear down of the mounting thread at the housing.The absence of scheduled maintenance except for visual inspection of the engine on that part, to be replaced only in case of failure, meant that the anomaly could not be detected before failure.The BEA reported the aircraft departed runway 36L and was climbing through 2800 feet when the crew heard two bangs and checked the engine parameters, which remained normal. The crew therefore continued the climb. At 4000 feet the crew received a fire indication for the left hand engine, worked the memory items to shut the engine down and discharge both fire suppression systems, then the fire indication ceased. The aircraft returned to Lyon for a safe landing on runway 36R.The BEA reported the occurrence happened after the engine had accumulated 14,343 cycles and 15,413 flying hours. The OBV was still the original factory mounted one. There were no maintenance records regarding the OBV even though the engine had undergone two checks at the manufacturer facilities.The BEA reported there had been two similiar cases of fuel pressure line separating from the OBV due to connector failure.The BEA reported that the manufacturer changed the maintenance requirements mandating, that the new OBVs (less than 6000 hours accumulated) should be replaced before reaching 12000 hours or within 4 years after the AD becoming effective (whichever occurs earlier), older OBVs (6000 hours or more) should be replaced before accumulating another 6000 hours or two years after the AD (whichever occurs first).On Jul 7th 2015 the French BEA released their English version of the final report.The failed fuel pressure line connector (Photo: BEA):Burn through the engine cover (Photo: BEA):
A Southwest Boeing 737-800, registration N8621A performing flight WN-2869 from Denver,CO to Los Angeles,CA (USA) with 183 people on board, was in the climb out of Denver's runway 34L when upon contacting departure the crew advised they suspected a blown tyre on takeoff and wanted to level off at 10,000 feet and return to Denver querying whether tower saw a tyre or debris of a tyre on the runway. Tower dispatched a runway inspection, which reported runway 34L was closed due to a lot of foreign object debris, a field about 2000 feet long consistent with a blown tyre, on the runway. In the meantime the crew advised they had lost A side hydraulics and would have no spoilers for landing, braking was unaffected however. Runway 34L, used as departure runway only, was prepared and opened for landing of WN-2869. Emergency services watching the aircraft on final approach through binoculars advised everything looked normal, during roll out emergency services commented it looked like there was a problem of the left main gear. The aircraft landed safely on runway 34L and stopped. Emergency services reported no brakes fire, the left inboard main tyre was blown, there was a little smoke from the left main gear and observed lots of hydraulic fluid from the left side of the fuselage, emergency services recommended to shut the engines down and run the APU, the aircraft was declared safe. Mobile stairs were taken to the aircraft's left main door, passengers disembarked via the stairs and were bussed to the terminal.A replacement Boeing 737-800 registration N8616C reached Los Angeles with a delay of 4:15 hours.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/SWA2869/history/20150705/2240Z/KDEN/KLAX
An Air France Airbus A320-200, registration F-HEPH performing flight AF-1134 from Paris Charles de Gaulle (France) to Berlin Tegel (Germany), was accelerating for takeoff from runway 27L when the left hand engine (CFM56) ingested a bird. The crew continued takeoff, climbed to 5000 feet, shut the engine down and returned to Paris for a safe landing on runway 27L about 20 minutes after departure.A passenger reported that the aircraft was accelerating for takeoff when suddenly there were heavy vibrations, the aircraft continued takeoff, became airborne and climbed out, then the vibrations ceased and it became unusually silent on board. The aircraft continued straight at low altitude for about 5 minutes, then the captain announced there had been a minor technical problem and they were returning to Paris. The purser subsequently announced that an engine had ingested a bird, flight attendants prepared the cabin for landing. After landing the captain announced that the left hand engine was vibrating following a bird strike. Upon disembarking the aircraft the passenger did not notice any visible damage. The flight was cancelled, the passengers were taken to hotels.
An ANZ Air New Zealand Boeing 777-200, registration ZK-OKG performing flight NZ-45 from Rarotonga (Cook Islands) to Auckland (New Zealand), had backtracked Roratonga's runway 26 for departure, turned around and accelerated the engines for takeoff on Jun 25th 2015 about 16:00L. Three people watching the Boeing 777 depart from the public road just outside the airport's perimeter fence, were blown away by the jet blast and received injuries. While the aircraft was climbing out of Rarotonga, an ambulance picked the three planespotters up and took them to a hospital. ZK-OKG arrived safely in Auckland on Jun 26th 2015 18:30L after about 4.5 hours flight time.The planespotters were discharged from hospital a week later.Local residents state, that the problem exists at the threshold runway 26 as the jet blast there just goes across the public road. There are warning signs at the fence, but not on the road. The sea wall side (threshold runway 08) is safer as the jet blast goes above the heads of the plane spotters there.Air New Zealand stated that they don't have control over the public roads, they understand however there are warning signs at the fence. Raroronga's Airport Authority repeated their warning to observe the red warning signs at the airport fence.The distance from the runway threshold to the public road at the east side (runway 26) is about 135 meters, usually less distance while engines accelerate for takeoff, on the west side (threshold 08) the distance between road and threshold is 160 meters, in addition the road is below the runway level.Another ANZ B772 taking off runway 26 in 2013 seen from the public road (Video: Gene MacRae):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRdjiRDgJmoMap (Graphics: Google Earth):

An Air Canada Embraer ERJ-190, registration C-FNAW performing flight AC-1121 from Toronto,ON to Saskatoon,SK (Canada) with 77 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff when an unusual odour was observed on board of the aircraft, the odour persisted during initial climb prompting the crew to stop the climb at 7000 feet and return to Toronto for a safe landing about 30 minutes after departure.The Canadian TSB reported that a maintenance investigation did not find any anomalies. Both air recirculation filters were replaced as a precaution and the aircraft returned to service.A replacement ERJ-190 registration C-FHKI reached Saskatoon with a delay of 2 hours.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/ACA1121/history/20150508/1200Z/CYYZ/CYXE
A Jordan Aviation Boeing 767-200 on behalf of Shaheen, registration JY-JAG performing flight NL-739 from Islamabad (Pakistan) to Riyadh (Saudi Arabia), was accelerating for takeoff from Islamabad's runway 30 when the left hand engine (CF6) emitted a loud bang, the left hand engine's fire indication illuminated. The crew continued takeoff, stopped the climb at 5000 feet performing the fire drill and returned to Islamabad for a safe landing on runway 30 about 15 minutes after departure.On Jun 16th 2015 the NTSB reported during the takeoff roll engine #1 failed, the crew received a fire warning, continued takeoff and made an air return to Islamabad, there were no injuries, Pakistan's Authorities are investigating the occurrence rated an incident.
An Enter Air Boeing 737-400, registration SP-ENA performing flight E4-1246 from Corfu (Greece) to Poznan (Poland) with 131 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Corfu/Kerkyra's runway 35 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (about 100 knots over ground) due to an open door indication. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The airline reported the bumpy runway at Corfu caused a door sensor to signal an open door. A replacement aircraft is being dispatched to Corfu and is currently estimated to reach Poznan with a delay of 9 hours.
A KLM Boeing 737-800, registration PH-BXI performing flight KL-1706 from Madrid,SP (Spain) to Amsterdam (Netherlands), was accelerating for takeoff from Madrid's runway 36R when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (approx. 45 knots) due to a door indication. The aircraft vacated the runway, the door was examined and closed again. The aircraft departed about 20 minutes after rejecting takeoff and reached Amsterdam on time.A passenger reported that immediately after the aircraft stopped the captain announced "passengers and crew remained seated", about a minute later the lead flight attendant announced the captain had aborted takeoff, the passengers reacting "no kidding", the captain later explained they had a door open indication. The right front door was examined, found not correctly closed, the door was properly closed, and the aircraft taxied to join the departure queue a second time. The captain announced it had been the first real life rejected takeoff of his career. The flight departed and reached Amsterdam almost on schedule.
An Avies British Aerospace Jetstream 31, registration SE-FVP performing flight U3-2082 from Kardla to Tallinn (Estonia) with 17 passengers and 2 crew, was in the initial acceleration for takeoff from Kardla's runway 14 at about 08:30L (06:30Z) when the left hand engine accelerated to takeoff power while the right engine remained in beta (reverse). The aircraft violently veered to the right and exited the runway about 20 meters down prompting the crew to reject takeoff at low speed. The aircraft came to a stop with all gear on soft ground (grass), the crew subsequently applied power to steer the aircraft onto the paved surface of the nearby taxiway and returned the aircraft to the apron. No injuries occurred, the aircraft did not sustain damage.The airline confirmed the aircraft veered off the runway due to strong gusting winds and a pilot error which resulted in the engines accelerating asymmetrically.A replacement Jetstream 31 registration ES-PJD reached Tallinn with a delay of 5 hours.According to the flight crew operations manuals it is necessary to move the throttle levers back slightly past ground idle (beta) to unlock the propeller blade latches to permit control over the propeller blade pitch angle and permit useful work of the engines. In addition, application of beta range during taxi to slow the aircraft is permitted however discouraged for noise abatement.Estonia's Safety Investigation Bureau (OJK) released their final report concluding the probable causes of the serious incident were:The cause of this serious incident is incorrect pilot action on propeller lock disengagement procedure. Pilots did not pull the throttle levers fully to REVERSE position and waited for torque increase, leaving RH propeller starting latches in the engaged position. The condition was left unnoticed by the pilots, resulting in asymmetrical thrust production while applying takeoff power.Contributory factors- None of the pilots tried to stop the aircraft exiting the runway by applying the brakes.- The fact that there is no indication in the cockpit with regards to the position of starting latches has caused pilots to develop and use multiple unofficial procedures to determine the condition of a propeller.The OJK reported the captain (56, ATPL, 14,500 hours total, 530 hours on type) was pilot flying, the first officer (49, ATPL, 2,500 hours total, 2,000 hours on type) was pilot monitoring. The crew performed before takeoff preparations, while reading the "after engine start" checklist the captain did not reply to the last item, "start locks" referencing the propeller start lock disengagement. The crew did not notice any anomalies while taxiing for departure, the before takeoff checklist was read and the captain applied takeoff power, which immediately resulted in the aircraft turning sharply right with the crew unable to maintain directional control with nose wheel steering or rudder. While the aircraft exited the runway the captain retarded the power levers to idle and regained directional control about 35 meters from the beginning of the takeoff roll on a grass strip between runway and apron, continued to taxi across the grass onto the apron, where the passengers disembarked. Following disembarkation of passengers the crew started the engines again, taxied onto the runway and performed a test of engines, propellers and systems without detecting any anomaly.The OJK reported: "Two hours of erased recordings were recovered from the CVR and sound spectrum analysis was performed. The CVR spectrum analysis reveal, that while the crew went through the After Start check list, the engines were running at approximately at 72% (76Hz). Just after co-pilot reads check-list item Start Locks, both engines were briefly brought to 81% (86Hz) and 80% (85Hz) one after the other during the check."The OJK analysed that there was no technical issue, the investigation therefore focussed on "crew coordination and training aspects".The OJK analysed: "It is evident from [cockpit voice recording] that even without the Captain replying, there has been some pilot action in order to disengage the start locks. The RPM applied has been enough to overcome the elastic forces of the start lock springs, what appears is, that the power levers were not being moved all the way to the REVERSE position, not waited for torque to increase, thus leaving the RH propeller on the starting locks. The fact that there is no indicator in the cockpit referring to the position of the start latches in the aircraft, the condition was left unnoticed for the flight crew during taxy and takeoff procedures. According to the captain statements  the flight crew did not check the torque indication when disengaging the start locks and the crew was not familiar to the start lock system construction or mechanics. After finishing the before takeoff checklist (at 29:50) pilots apply takeoff power (at 30:10). As the RPM increases, within two seconds (at 30:12) the aircraft banks sharply to the right due to the asymmetrical thrust that is produced by the engines and propellers. LH propeller unlocked from the starting latches and the pitch controllable in the flight range (alpha range), producing takeoff thrust. RH propeller locked on the starting latches in the ground mode (beta range), producing thrust required for ground operations."Metars:EEKA 280850Z 22012KT 9999 BKN011 ///// Q0992=EEKA 280750Z 22008KT 9999 SCT011 ///// Q0992=EEKA 280650Z 22008KT 9999 FEW011 ///// Q0992=EEKA 280550Z 24009KT 9999 SCT011 ///// Q0992=EEKA 280450Z NIL=EEKA 280350Z 23008KT 9999 BKN009 BKN064 ///// Q0991=EEKA 280250Z 23009KT 9999 OVC009 ///// Q0999=Ground tracks (Photo: OJK):
A Lufthansa Boeing 737-300, registration D-ABEK performing flight LH-1363 from Katowice (Poland) to Frankfurt/Main (Germany), had lined up (old) runway 27 for departure, the tail of the aircraft extended to before the runway threshold lights. The aircraft was subsequently cleared for takeoff from Katowice's runway 27 and accelerated the engines when parts of the asphalt pavement were blown up by the engines' jet streams, debris impacted the left hand stabilizer. The crew, unaware of the damage, continued the flight and landed the aircraft safely in Frankfurt. Only there it was discovered the aircraft had sustained substantial damage to the left hand horizontal stabilizer.Poland's State Commission on Aircraft Accident Investigations (PKBWL) opened an investigation into the occurrence reporting: The aircraft taxied onto the runway via taxiways E and F and lined up at the threshold of runway 27 with the tail of the aircraft above and before the runway threshold lights. After receiving takeoff clearance, when the engines were accelerated, parts of the asphalt pavement were blown off the ground by the jet stream off the engines and struck the left hand stabilizer. The crew, "blissfully unaware of the damage", made the cruise to Frankfurt, where substantial damage to the left hand horizontal stabilizer was discovered. The occurrence aircraft returned to service on May 17th 2015.Radar data confirm the aircraft took off the old runway 27, since May 28th 2015 used as taxiway with the new runway 27 to the north now in operation.Metars:EPKT 020600Z 01007KT 6000 FEW004 SCT006 08/07 Q1008=EPKT 020530Z 01005KT 4000 BR FEW004 08/07 Q1008=EPKT 020500Z 01004KT 350V060 2000 BR NSC 07/07 Q1008=EPKT 020430Z 35003KT 280V020 1800 BR NSC 07/07 Q1007=EPKT 020400Z 36002KT 1600 BR NSC 07/07 Q1007=EPKT 020330Z 34003KT 2000 MIFG BR FEW001 07/07 Q1007=EPKT 020300Z 07003KT 2500 MIFG BR NSC 07/07 Q1006=EPKT 020230Z 07002KT 4000 BR NSC 07/07 Q1006=EPKT 020200Z 08002KT 3000 BR NSC 07/07 Q1006=EPKT 020130Z 05002KT 2000 BR NSC 07/07 Q1006=EPKT 020100Z 36003KT 1200 R27/2000 BR NSC 07/07 Q1006= Aerodrome Chart until May 28th 2015 (Graphics: AIP Poland):
A UTAir Boeing 737-500, registration VQ-BJT performing flight UT-500 from Anapa to Moscow Vnukovo (Russia) with 15 passengers, was accelerating for takeoff from Anapa's runway 04 when an engine (CFM56) ingested a bird prompting the crew to reject takeoff. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The passengers were rebooked onto the next flight.The occurrence aircraft reached Moscow as flight UT-500 the following day with a delay of 31 hours.
A Travel Service Boeing 737-800 on behalf of Smartwings, registration OK-TVH performing flight QS-7416 from Katowice (Poland) to Kerkyra/Corfu (Greece) with 195 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Katowice's runway 09 when a right main tyre burst prompting the crew to reject takeoff at high speed. The aircraft slowed safely and stopped about 1200 meters/3950 feet down the runway. Emergency services responded and checked the brakes. The runway and airport was closed for about one hour until the aircraft was moved off the runway.A replacement Boeing 737-800 registration OK-TVG reached Corfu with a delay of 3 hours.
A Jazz Canadair CRJ-200, registration C-GUJA performing flight QK-7654 from Montreal,QC (Canada) to Washington National,DC (USA) with 49 passengers and 3 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Montreal's runway 24R when the aircraft showed a strong tendency to turn left despite full right rudder. The crew rejected takeoff at low speed (below 60 KIAS), the aircraft returned to the apron.A replacement Canadair CRJ-200 registration C-GKGC reached Washington with a delay of 2 hours.The occurrence aircraft was able to resume service about 24 hours after the rejected takeoff.The Canadian TSB reported the crew rejected takeoff due to control problems, the aircraft had a tendency to the left despite full right rudder, the crew rejected takeoff below 60 KIAS.
A Kulula Boeing 737-800, registration ZS-ZWP performing flight MN-104 from Cape Town to Johannesburg (South Africa) with 181 passengers and 6 crew, rejected takeoff from Cape Town at low speed after the right hand engine (CFM56) emitted a huge bang and ejected debris axially (contained). The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The runway was temporarily closed for a runway inspection and sweeping to clean the debris, mainly separated turbine blades.The airline confirmed the aircraft rejected the takeoff at low speed due to an engine failure, the engine was shut down and the aircraft returned to the apron. Something flew into the engine resulting in the failure.South Africa's CAA reported in their list of February incidents released on Mar 26th 2013, that the right hand engine failed, the aircraft rejected takeoff and returned to the apron on the left hand engine.ZS-ZWP resumed service on Mar 3rd 2013.On May 27th 2015 South Africa's Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) released their final report concluding the probable cause of the incident was:Aborted take-off as a result of the No. 2 engine failure due to the failure of the HPT blade.Contributory factorFailure of the HPT blade coating resulting on a corrosion and a subsequent failure of the bladesThe aircraft was accelerating for takeoff on Cape Town's runway 01 when at about 30 knots a loud bang was heard followed by vibrations, the right hand engine's N1 and N2 instruments rapidly spooled down to zero and the crew rejected takeoff within 50 meters. Tower activated the crash alarm, two fire vehicles responded to the aircraft and found engine debris on a substantial area of the runway surface. The crew completed the "engine severe damage memory items" checklist and taxied the aircraft to the apron.A post event examination of the right hand engine revealed "excessive" damage to the engine including deformations of the engine casing, the engine parts had been contained however. There was extensive turbine blade damage visible from the tail pipe. Further examination showed the forward sump scavenge strainer plug was found contaminated with composite material from the high pressure turbine seal. Loose studs with the nuts still attached were found inside the engine at the bottom of the casing.The flight data recorder had not recorded any anomaly prior to the event.The engine was shipped for examination by the manufacturer, a boroscopic inspection there identified three high pressure turbine blades had liberated below their platforms. The CAA analysed: "Fracture surface analysis of under-platform separated blades revealed that the primary fatigue crack initiation occurred via multiple origins from the internal surface located within the cavity. The analysis also showed evidence of secondary fatigue crack initiation on the internal surface of the cavity. Heavy oxidation was observed on the crack surface and most of the blade fracture surface showed characteristics of tensile overload as a result of secondary impact damage."Debris scattered on the runway surface (Photo: SACAA):Turbine blade damage seen from the tailpipe (Photo: SACAA):Probable origin of studs and composite material (Sketch: SACAA):
An Avianca Brasil Airbus A318-100, registration PR-OND performing flight O6-6377 from Juazeiro Do Norte,CE to Sao Paulo Guarulhos,SP (Brazil), rejected takeoff from Juazeiro Do Norte's runway 13 at low speed after the left hand engine (PW6122) emitted a loud bang and came to a stop about 350 meters/1150 feet down the runway. A passenger opened an overwing exit without instruction causing the overwing slide to deploy and immobilizing the aircraft. The passengers subsequently disembarked onto the runway and were taken to the terminal.The flight was cancelled.The aftermath after engine problem (Video: Cariri, como eu vejo):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sVA00OSKzUThe aircraft on the runway after the rejected takeoff:
A Kazan Aircraft Production Association Antonov AN-26B, registration RA-26082 performing a freight flight from Magadan to Mirny (Russia) with 8 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Magadan's runway 10 at 11:35L (01:35Z) when the aircraft suffered an engine failure, veered right off the runway and came to a stop on deeply snow covered soft ground with the right main gear collapsed. No injuries occurred, the aircraft received substantial damage including a fractured wing, engine and propeller damage.Russia's Ministry for Emergency Situations (MCHS) reported the aircraft was carrying cargo from Magadan to Mirny when the aircraft went off the runway. There were no injuries, no fuel spill and no fire.Ground observers reported the aircraft was accelerating for takeoff when the right hand engine failed and the aircraft went off the runway coming to a stop in rough terrain in deep snow.On Jan 12th 2015 the Interstate Aviation Committee (MAK) reported the 4 main crew and 4 backup crew remained uninjured, the AN-26 RA-26082 sustained substantial damage however. The MAK have opened an investigation into the accident.On Jan 20th 2015 Rosaviatsia reported that during the takeoff run the nose gear steering wheel had not been disengaged, which disabled nose gear steering via the rudder pedals. The captain, instead of rejecting takeoff, attempted but failed to disengage the steering wheel, only at rotation speed of 250kph (135 knots) the crew rejected takeoff but could not keep the aircraft on the runway, which veered to the right and exited the runway about 2300 meters down the runway, went 490 meters over snow covered soft ground and stopped 24 meters to the right of the runway edge. During the movement over terrain the aircraft sustained substantial damage, nose and right main gear collapsed, right engine, right propeller and right wing damaged. The crew remained uninjured. The captain had 2290 hours on type, the first officer 94 hours on type. On May 19th 2015 the Interstate Aviation Committee (MAK) released their final report in Russian concluding the probable causes of the accident were:The accident occurred as result of the aircraft departing the side of the runway after the commander rejected takeoff after having been unable to use the elevator because of the yoke's locked position.The roll beyond the edge of the runway was likely caused by the flight engineer while attempting to operate the handle to release the flight controls lock while the aircraft was already accelerating for takeoff.The accident was thus caused by this combination of factors:- violation of requirements by FCOM to ascertain the flight controls were free and usable before engine start- failure by the crew to execute the checklists to check elevator, rudder and ailerons were free to move before takeoff- flight crew receives insufficient practise in real flight to maintain skills acquired during simulator training in the management of the aircraft and its systems resulting in negative impact during emergency situationsThe MAK recommended that a warning should be installed to make the crew aware the yoke was still locked.The MAK reported that during the takeoff roll the captain (54, ATPL, 3,783 hours total, 2,240 hours on type and in command) was unable to rotate the aircraft for takeoff and decided to reject takeoff, but could not keep the aircraft on the runway, the aircraft veered right off the runway. The crew reduced both engines to idle and brought the propellers into beta range. The aircraft crossed rough terrain and received substantial damage as result of the forces created by the rough terrain. There were no injuries to the occupants of the aircraft.The captain had been assisted by a first officer (56, ATPL, 11,986 hours total, 94 hours on type), a flight engineer (59, FEL, 9,057 hours total, 9,057 hours on type) and a navigator (63, NavL, 7,196 hours total, 2,910 hours on type).The MAK reported the aircraft crossed the right edge of the runway 2454 meters down the runway, went over soft ground for 360 meters, then crossed a road encountering forces that caused the nose gear, right main gear and right wing to fracture, the fuselage to bend and the right engine and propeller to receive damage, and came to a stop a further 133 meters past the road, 2940 meters past the runway threshold and 24 meters off the right edge of the runway. Immediately when the aircraft departed from the runway tower, observing the takeoff roll, activated the crash button sounding a sirene, which called 65 emergency personnel on 18 vehicles, 3 of them being fire engines, into action.The MAK reported, that a lever is used to lock all control surfaces, including elevator, ailerons and rudder. If the lever is in the upper position, all surfaces are locked. If the lever, after pushing its unlock button, is moved to the down position, all flight surfaces are released and are free to move. With the control surfaces locked it was not possible to advance the power levers beyond 30% of power setting.Experiments showed however, that an intermediate position of the lever was possible, in which all control surfaces, elevator, rudder and aileron were free, but the yoke's movement remained locked and power levers were free to move to takeoff power.In violation of the FCOM requirements to check elevators, ailerons and rudders to freely move before commencing takeoff the crew did not check whether elevators, ailerons and rudder were free to move.After the aircraft had begun the takeoff roll and the elevator could not be moved, the captain as well as the flight engineer attempted to release the flight controls by moving the handle to unlock the flight controls. This caused the decision to reject takeoff to be delayed until the departure from the runway could no longer be prevented.The MAK analysed that in the before start engines checklist the checklists require flight crews to check that elevator, ailerons and rudder are free to be moved to their mechanical stops. This has first to be checked by the first officer, then the captain. However, during preflight preparation the navigator announced the controls were free, although he had no possibility to check the status of the flight controls, and neither first officer nor captain performed their flight controls checks.After engine start, while taxiing towards the departure runway, the crew set the flaps to 15 degrees, the checklist again called for a check of the flight controls, both first officer and captain called "flight controls free" however without conducting the checks.The aircraft lined up, the engines were set to takeoff power and the takeoff roll appeared normal. The aircraft reached 200 kph (108 KIAS), decision speed V1, the captain called "go", at 210 kph the call "rotate" occurred about 1170 meters down the runway, however, no response was seen on the elevator. Instead the captain called an expletive indicative of first recognition of an abnormal situation on board. The captain attempted to release the flight controls in order to free the controls.The MAK further analysed that the runway was much longer than needed for the takeoff of the AN-26. The crew therefore did not appreciate how dangerous the situation had become, after the captain attempted to release the flight controls lock the flight engineer attempted to unlock the controls. Only then the takeoff was rejected. The MAK analysed that only after reaching decision speed and the decision to continue takeoff the emergency arose putting the crew into an unusual and rare situation. Regulations only stated that takeoff should be discontinued if conditions occur before V1 that the captain assesses as a risk to the safe conduct of the flight, there was no guideline for a situation that prevented safe flight after reaching V1. The MAK analysed that had the crew rejected takeoff shortly after reaching V1 at 210kph, the aircraft would have needed a total of 2100 meters for acceleration and deceleration until coming to a stop, with 3452 meters of runway available this would have posed no problem. However, after the captain attempted to unlock the flight controls the aircraft had accelerated to 260kph (140 knots), at this time the aircraft had already travelled 1780 meters and had just 1670 meters of runway remaining, when the captain asked the flight engineer to attempt unlock the flight controls. While attempting to move the lever it is likely from the data recorder that the rudder moved a bit though remaining near the neutral position which caused the aircraft to slightly veer to the right. The takeoff was finally rejected when the aircraft had travelled about 2000 meters down the runway after the commander had concluded the aircraft would not be able to fly. The engines were brought to idle, the propellers put into beta, the aircraft departed the right edge of the runway 2454 meters down the runway at a speed of 250kph, crossed a road which caused substantial damage to the aircraft, that came to a stop 2940 meters past the runway threshold and 24 meters to the right of the runway right edge.Metars:UHMM 030300Z 34006MPS 9999 DRSN BKN100 OVC200 M10/M18 Q0987 NOSIG RMK QFE726 88420260=UHMM 030230Z 34006MPS 9999 DRSN BKN100 OVC200 M10/M18 Q0987 NOSIG RMK QFE726 88420250=UHMM 030200Z 30004MPS 260V340 9999 OVC100 M10/M18 Q0988 NOSIG RMK QFE726 88420250=UHMM 030130Z 32004MPS 9999 FEW040 OVC100 M09/M18 Q0988 NOSIG RMK QFE726 88420250=UHMM 030100Z 33006MPS 9999 FEW040 OVC100 M09/M17 Q0988 NOSIG RMK QFE726 88420250 FBL TURB 0-1000=UHMM 030030Z 32004MPS 9999 FEW040 BKN100 OVC200 M09/M17 Q0988 NOSIG RMK QFE727 88420250 FBL TURB 0-1000=UHMM 030000Z 31004MPS 9999 FEW040 BKN100 OVC200 M09/M16 Q0989 NOSIG RMK QFE727 88420250 FBL TURB 0-1000=UHMM 022330Z 34003MPS 300V090 9999 FEW040 BKN100 OVC200 M09/M17 Q0989 NOSIG RMK QFE727 88420250 FBL TURB 0-1000=UHMM 022300Z 06003G08MPS 350V140 9999 SCT040 OVC100 M06/M15 Q0989 NOSIG RMK QFE727 88420250 MT OPEN=UHMM 022230Z 04005G10MPS 010V090 9999 SCT040 OVC100 M07/M15 Q0989 NOSIG RMK QFE727 88420250=UHMM 022200Z 04005MPS 360V070 9999 SCT040 OVC100 M07/M15 Q0989 RMK QFE727=UHMM 022100Z 07004MPS 9999 SCT040 OVC100 M09/M16 Q0989 RMK QFE727=UHMM 022000Z 03006MPS 9999 FEW040 OVC100 M08/M17 Q0989 RMK QFE727= The aircraft off the runway (Photos: MCHS):
A SAS Scandinavian Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-82, registration SE-DIK performing flight SK-2537 from Copenhagen (Denmark) to Dublin (Ireland) with 104 passengers and 5 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Copenhagen's runway 22R when the left hand engine (JT8D) emitted a loud bang and the aircraft started veering left prompting the crew to reject takeoff at 76 KIAS. The aircraft slowed safely, with no fire indication and no smoke present the crew vacated the runway, shut the engine down and requested emergency services to check the left hand engine.A runway inspection revealed engine debris on the runway.The Danish Havarilkommission (HCL) reported a first preliminary engine inspection revealed the front compressor drive turbine had disintegrated and opened an investigation into the serious incident.On May 12th 2015 Denmark's HCL released their bulletin reporting that the engine failure was contained and concluded:Based on the findings, the AIB concludes that the fracture in the 3rd stage LPT blade number one was caused by fatigue. Neither defects nor structural abnormalities explained the initiation of the fatigue crack.The HCL reported: "The visual examination of the engine revealed that all 3rd stage low pressure turbine (LPT) 88 blades were fractured at or near the airfoil root above the flowpath platform. The examination revealed that one of the 3rd stage LPT blades (blade number one) had signs of heat and fatigue in the fractured area. There were no indications or signs of fatigue on the remaining parts of the other 3rd stage LPT disk blades. All 4th stage LPT blades were fractured at the blade airfoil roots. The remaining parts of the 4th stage LPT disk blades did not reveal any evidence of fatigue. There were no observed signs of LPT or exhaust case breaches, no signs of case flanges breaches, and all observations indicated a contained engine."The HCL analysed: "All the 3rd LPT blades were installed as OH blades during a back shop visit in 2006. The visual examination of the 3rd LPT revealed that one (blade number one) of the 88 3rd LPT blades had signs of fatigue. The SEM confirmed the fatigue area and the microstructure examination clarified that there was no material or structural abnormalities present. ... The indications for 3rd stage LPT blades notch wear could not be observed. The root cause to the fatigue could not be exactly determined. However, a possible scenario, which might have led to fatigue, might be a result of wear in the mechanical blade interlocking feature during normal operation. This might have led to worn 3rd stage LPT blade notches and loss of vibration damping."The damage to 3rd stage low pressure turbine (Photo: HCL):
A Vueling Airbus A320-200, registration EC-LZZ performing flight VY-3711 from Menorca,SP to Barcelona,SP (Spain), was accelerating for takeoff from Menorca's runway 19L when the left hand engine (CFM56) ingested a bird responding with a loud bang and a flash prompting the crew to reject takeoff at high speed. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The flight was cancelled.
A Vueling Airbus A320-200, registration EC-MAO performing flight VY-6281 from Genoa to Rome Fiumicino (Italy), was climbing out of Genoa's runway 28 when the crew levelled off at 4000 feet reporting a bird strike upon takeoff rotation, the left hand engine (CFM56) needed to be shut down. The aircraft returned to Genoa for a safe landing on runway 28 about 15 minutes after departure.A passenger reported there were serious vibrations and loud noise from the right hand engine during rotation and initial climb. 
A Swiss Airbus A320-200, registration HB-IJS performing flight LX-521 from Nice (France) to Geneva (Switzerland) with 146 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Nice's runway 04R.At the same time a THY Turkish Airlines Boeing 737-800, registration TC-JHN performing flight TK-1813 from Istanbul (Turkey) to Nice (France), was on final approach to runway 04L but went around from low height (about 375 feet AGL) prompting tower to instruct LX-521 to stop.The crew of LX-521 rejected takeoff at low speed (about 75 KIAS), slowed the aircraft safely, returned to the holding point runway 04R and departed about 7 minutes after rejecting takeoff.A passenger reported the crew announced they had rejected takeoff at about 75 knots on ATC instruction due to an aircraft going around on the parallel runway.
A United Boeing 757-200, registration N17105 performing flight UA-70 from Newark,NJ (USA) to Amsterdam (Netherlands) with 135 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from runway 04L when the next departure cleared to line up runway 04L reported seeing smoke and sparks from the left main gear, Tower repeated flames from the engine or the wheels. The crew reject takeoff at low speed, steered the aircraft off the runway and stopped on the adjacent taxiway, tower instructed the aircraft to hold position while emergency services were responding. No fire was detected, the passengers disembarked onto the taxiway and were bussed to the terminal.A replacement Boeing 757-200 registration N17133 reached Amsterdam with a delay of 4 hours.The airport reported smoke and sparks were observed from the left landing gear, no fire was detected, the smoke seemed to originate from the brakes, that appeared to have locked up.The airline reported firefighters responded but found no fire, the aircraft is being checked.
A Blue Bird Aviation de Havilland Dash 8-400, registration 5Y-VVY performing a flight from Nairobi Wilson (Kenya) to Mogadishu (Somalia) with 3 crew, rejected takeoff from Wilson Airport's runway 14 at high speed at about 07:05L (04:05Z), came to a stop off the runway heading and past the runway end on soft ground and was disabled.The runway was closed for about 3 hours until the aircraft could be moved off the runway.A ground observer reported the aircraft may have partially gone off the runway, but was too far away to be sure about the observation.Bluebird Aviation usually performs freight flights from Wilson Airport destined for Somalia.In April 2015 Kenya's Air Accident Investigation Department (AAID) released their final report into the serious incident concluding the probable causes was:The probable cause of the incident was failure of flight crew to execute maximum continuous braking during a rejected takeoff before V1. The key contributory factor was concentration of the flight crew on steering the aircraft back to the runway centerline after it veered to the right.The AAID reported the first officer (CPL, 2,404 hours total, 958 hours on type) was assigned pilot flying for the sector, the captain (37, ATPL, 10,701 hours total, 4,063 hours on type) was pilot monitoring. Following preflight checks, completion of mass and balance computations with 8 tons of cargo, the aircraft taxied to runway 14.The aircraft was configured for a takeoff with flaps at 15 degrees. Tower changed the departure clearance of the aircraft assigning an immediate left turn to 050 degrees after takeoff. The captain thought the maneouver was too challenging and decided to fly the departure himself. The captain explained the modified clearance that with the initial clearance they would have needed to wait until all aircraft lined up for landing on Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport runway 06 had landed. After receiving takeoff clearance the captain initiated takeoff, the first officer called 80 knots, the captain cross checked and saw engines still accelerating but all parameters normal. A few seconds later he noticed the InterTurbine Temperature (ITT) of the left hand engine had gone into the red area and was reading between 840 and 880 degrees C, the captain decided to reject takeoff, the speed was 105 KIAS at that point, about 500 meters of runway were remaining. The captain retarded power levers and initiated braking, the aircraft veered off the runway center line to the right side of the runway prompting the captain to release the brakes while steering the aircraft back onto the runway center line. When the aircraft was back on the center line and steady the captain again applied braking however was unable to stop the aircraft before the runway end. The aircraft came to a stop 67 meters past the runway end.The AAID continued that the crew radioed tower that they had overshot the runway, tower cleared the aircraft to make a 180 turn back onto the runway. The aircraft however was unable to move and needed to be towed.The AAID analysed: "The Captain rejected takeoff as per Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) when he noticed an abnormal engine indication of high ITT before the V1 speed. After retarding power on both engines, the aircraft veered to the right hand side of the runway centerline. It was considered that this was possibly as a result of one engine reacting faster than the other or the brakes on the right MLG were more effective than those on the left MLG. The Captain released the brakes to concentrate on steering the aircraft to the runway centerline. He resumed braking again once the aircraft was steady and close to the centerline. Therefore, there was no continuous maximum braking action from the flight crew after the decision to reject the takeoff was made. The decision to reject the takeoff was made when the aircraft had attained a speed to approximately 105 knots and after crossing the intersection of runways 14 and 07. The remaining runway length available to stop the aircraft was approximately 500 meters. Apart from the braking action which was not continuous, no other speed reducing devices were employed by the crew to stop the aircraft. The flight crew concentration during the rejected takeoff temporarily shifted to steering the aircraft which had veered to the right back to the centerline. In addition, the aircraft was loaded with 8 tonnes of cargo and therefore had substantial momentum at 105 knots. All these factors contributed to the crew not being able to stop the aircraft within the runway length."Metars for Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta Airport about 7nm east of Wilson Airport:HKJK 080500Z 06005KT 9999 BKN020 19/17 Q1023 NOSIG HKJK 080430Z 04004KT 9999 SCT006 BKN019 18/17 Q1023 NOSIG HKJK 080400Z 07006KT 9999 FEW007 BKN018TCU 17/17 Q1022 NOSIGHKJK 080330Z 05004KT 9999 FEW012 BKN018 17/16 Q1022 NOSIG HKJK 080300Z 05004KT 9999 FEW012 BKN018 17/16 Q1022 NOSIG HKJK 080230Z 03004KT 9999 FEW007 BKN018 17/16 Q1022 NOSIG HKJK 080200Z 36003KT 9999 FEW005 BKN019 18/17 Q1021 NOSIG Ground tracks (Photo: AAID):The aircraft past the runway end (Photos: AAID):
A Mombasa Air Safari Let L-410, registration 5Y-UVP performing a safari flight from Ngerenge to Mombasa (Kenya) with 11 passengers and 2 crew, failed to climb out on takeoff from Ngerenge Airstrip in the Masai Mara National Park causing the aircraft to impact ground at about 12:17L (09:17Z). The aircraft was destroyed, both pilots and two passengers died, 3 passengers were flown to hospitals in Nairobi (Kenya) in critical condition, the remaining 6 passengers received injuries of varying degree.The airstrip manager reported the Let L-410 5Y-UV7 failed to climb out due to "wrong wind direction", a small fire was quickly put out by hotel personnel and tourists and the occupants were recovered from the wreckage. The injured are being treated by the Flying Doctors arriving from Nairobi. The aircraft had arrived from Mombasa via Amboseli National Park and had dropped off 12 passengers.The Flying Doctor Service reported 4 people had perished when the Flying Doctors reached the airstrip, 3 passengers were flown to Nairobi in critical condition, the remaining 6 passengers are being taken to Nairobi on a second ambulance aircraft. 5 Germans, 4 Americans and 2 Czech were on board of the aircraft. 2 Germans and the 2 Kenyan crew died in the accident.Kenya Wildlife Service reported the aircraft had just taken off when it lost height and impacted ground.Local police reported four occupants died on the spot, the injured have all been taken to Nairobi for treatment.In November 2012 the German BFU reported in their August bulletin, that after takeoff the aircraft rolled around its longitudinal axis and crashed.A passenger (witness), who had just disembarked 5Y-UVP at Ngerenge, told The Aviation Herald on Dec 12th 2012, that he was getting organised for his onward travel when the airport manager raised the alert. The aircraft had departed towards the west (approx heading 275 degrees), the witness however has no own observations of the actual departure and took notice only after the alert was raised. The aircraft had impacted trees at the west end of the strip and came to rest about 300 meters southwest of the end of the strip. After the alert everybody, including the witness, rushed to their jeeps and sped to the crash site in order to recover the survivors. There were no tracks on the ground leading towards the crash site suggesting that the aircraft had hit ground and slid towards its final position, the witness therefore believes the aircraft came to rest right at that point of impact. The captain was found trapped into the cockpit, the first officer had been thrown out of the cockpit. The front of the aircraft was covered with fuel and there were wild life issues which made the recovery of the captain urgent but difficult, he was recovered later the day. The survivors amongst the passengers were recovered, one of the survivors seated at the right hand side just aft of the wing said one of the engines had stopped prior to hitting the trees, the witness seems to recall the survivor also recalled the propeller had stopped. The witness recalls that the left hand engine was missing from the left hand side, the right hand engine came to rest next to the aircraft. The witness stated, that the aircraft had suffered a problem with one of the compasses at takeoff from Ukunda Airstrip, the aircraft was such flown to Mombasa Moi Airport, where it spent about an hour until a circuit breaker accessible only from the outside of the aircraft had been reset, then the aircraft set off for Amboseli and Ngerenge.Mombasa Air Safari is known to recently operate three Let-410s, 5Y-UVP, 5Y-NIK and 5Y-BSM.Ngerende Airstrip features a dirt runway of 3900 feet/1190 meters length in approximate east/west direction, approximate position S1.084 E35.186.No weather data are available.On Apr 28th 2015 Kenya's Ministry of Transport released a report marked as "preliminary report" but carrying all indications of a final report concluding the probable causes of the accident were:- LH engine was most probably not developing power at the time of impact- LH engine propeller was most probably in feather at the time of impact- Both CVR and FDR were unserviceable at the time of the accident- AAID was unable to determine origin of contaminant found in LH engine FCU- Sufficient oversight was not exercised over the Operator- High turnover of the Operators staff.Kenya's AAID reported the captain (59, ATPL, about 9800 hours total) had 7,480 flying hours on type and was assisted by a first officer (24, CPL) with 312 hours on type. The aircraft had landed at Ngerende to drop off 6 of the 17 passengers on board, no passenger or cargo was picked up at Ngerende, no refueling took place at the unmanned airstrip featuring a murram (loose surface) runway 10/28 of 1250 meters length and a windsock.Due to prevailing winds runway 28 was in use, the aircraft lined up runway 28 and commenced takeoff. Ground staff reported that departure roll as well as rotation were uneventful, during the initial climb the aircraft veered sharply to the left and disappeared behind terrain, shortly followed by a loud bang and dust rising into the air. Staff at the airport and the hotels rushed to the accident scene about 310 meters past the end of runway 28 at position S1.084189 E35.1781127, all wreckage was located within a radius of 10-20 meters, and reached the wreckage 7 minutes after the accident. They found the cockpit and forward passenger cabin completely destroyed with both flight crew and the passengers in the front row perished, the aft passenger cabin remained largely intact with seats and seatbelts remaining intact, the 6 passengers seated in this area survived and were taken to Nairobi with minor injuries. The report did not mention where the 3 passengers receiving serious injuries had been seated, but confirmed the two flight crew and two passengers died in the accident, 3 passengers received serious and 6 received minor injuries.The AAID reported the aircraft was equipped with a flight data and cockpit voice recorder, both devices were inoperative however during the accident flight.The AAID analysed that the fuel control unit (FCU) of the left hand engine showed indications of a contamination, the analysis of the contaminant to its origin and composition was inconclusive. According to strip analysis the left hand propeller most likely was in feathered position at impact rotating at low speed.The scene after recovery of survivors incl. left engine (Photo: Witness):Right hand engine and propeller of 5Y-UVP at the very left (Photo: AFP):5Y-UVP in final position (Photo: AFP):5Y-UVP in final position:Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):

A Thomas Cook Airbus A330-200, registration G-OMYT performing flight MT-314 from Manchester,EN (UK) to Punta Cana (Dominican Republic) with 325 people on board, rejected takeoff from Manchester's runway 23R at high speed (about 140 knots) after the right hand engine (Trent 772) emitted a loud bang and failed. The aircraft slowed safely and came to a stop at about half way down the runway. Emergency services responded and checked engine and brakes, the aircraft taxied to the apron afterwards where emergency services cooled down the brakes.A replacement Airbus A330-200 registration G-MDBD departed Manchester 5 hours after the rejected takeoff and is currently estimated to reach Punta Cana with a delay of 6 hours.The airline confirmed the incident aircraft rejected takeoff due to an engine failure. The engine is currently being examined.On Jul 2nd 2013 the French BEA reported the takeoff was rejected at 140 knots due to an engine fault. The AAIB have opened an investigation into the occurrence rated a serious incident.On Dec 12th 2013 the British AAIB reported in their bulletin that the takeoff was rejected at 105 KIAS after a flash and smoke from the right hand engine and associated loss of power. The investigation determined that the right hand engine failed because of the fracture of the a single high pressure turbine blade as result of high cycle fatigue crack propagation, causing an engine surge and damage further downstream into the intermediate and low pressure turbines and nozzles. Although the investigation report didn't name the videographer, it is obvious from the narration they used the Simon Lowe's video shown below as evidence into the investigation, too. The AAIB reported that both IP (intermediate pressure) and LP (low pressure) spools of the engine became seized as result of debris jammed between turbine rotors and casings during run down of the engine. The AAIB stated: "Laboratory analysis of the fractured blade root found multiple crack initiation locations caused by Type 2 Sulphidation corrosion. This led to high-cycle fatigue (HCF) propagation, weakening of the blade and subsequent material rupture in tensile overload. In addition, unidentified deposits were present on the surfaces of the blade remains which are the subject of ongoing analysis by the manufacturer." On Feb 12th 2015 the AAIB released an amendment to their Bulletin reading: "The failure of the HP turbine blade in this incident was caused by high cycle fatigue propagation due to surface damage as a result of Type 2 Sulphidation corrosion. During examination of the remains of the blade, to determine the cause of its failure, unidentified deposits were found on its surfaces. There was concern that these deposits may have been volcanic in origin, in particular from the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull in Iceland, so additional forensic analysis was carried out. That work was completed in August 2014 and did not identify compounds typically associated with volcanic activity. However, although an encounter with volcanic gaseous sulphur cannot be discounted it is concluded that the deposits probably are an accumulation of atmospheric dirt and pollutants."Video by ground observer (Video: Simon Lowe):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS1YAX70edcAnother ground observer's video (Video: Eddie Leathwood):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRL8MPnXmFw

A Ryanair Boeing 737-800, registration EI-DHB performing flight FR-813 from Edinburgh,SC (UK) to Dublin (Ireland), departed Edinburgh's runway 24 but burst a tyre upon takeoff rotation. The aircraft stopped the climb at FL100 and returned to Edinburgh for a safe landing on runway 24 about 25 minutes after departure.The occurrence aircraft was able to depart Edinburgh about 7 hours after landing back and reached Dublin as flight FR-8133 with a delay of 7.5 hours.
A Hawaiian Airlines Airbus A330-200, registration N370HA performing flight HA-445 from Honolulu,HI (USA) to Auckland (New Zealand) with 201 passengers and 12 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Honolulu's runway 08R when the crew rejected takeoff at about 80 KIAS reporting an unreliable airspeed. The aircraft slowed safely, vacated the runway and stopped on an adjacent taxiway to be checked out by emergency services. At that point a number of main tyres deflated.A replacement Airbus A330-200 registration N373HA reached Auckland with a delay of 8:20 hours.The left hand main tyres (Photo: Jay Templeton):
A Virgin Australia Airbus A330-200, registration VH-XFB performing flight VA-558 from Perth,WA to Sydney,NS (Australia) with an unknown number of passengers and 15 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Perth when cabin crew in the rear of the cabin noticed a burning odour starting when the engines accelerated for takeoff. Cabin crew initially dismissed the odour as relatively common. The purser assisted in locating the source of the odour, the fridges were turned off believing they might cause the odour, the odour however persisted. The purser eventually identified a vent at the aft cabin bulkhead. A number of cabin crew were negatively affected and were unable to continue their inflight duties, the captain considered to divert to Adelaide,SA (Australia) but decided to continue to Sydney reasoning that the affected cabin crew were administered oxygen and recovered. The aircraft landed in Sydney without further incident.The captain made a log entry reporting acrid fumes at the rear aft galley after takeoff.The ATSB released their brief final report releasing following safety message:Fumes can originate from a wide range of sources. While some fumes may appear subtle and innocuous, they may be the first indication of a more serious problem. Furthermore, the effect of fumes on the human body is dependent on many variables, including the nature and intensity of the fumes, and the duration of exposure. This incident serves to highlight the importance of treating all fumes with suspicion, and implementing a cautious and conservative response, consistent with published guidance.The ATSB reported that maintenance subsequently found a portion of insulation blankets attached to the rear pressure bulkhead had collapsed and came into contact with the APU bleed air duct where the duct passes through the aft pressure bulkhead. The investigation determined that the blankets had been improperly installed by the previous operator of the aircraft.The ATSB wrote: "The insulation blanket is constructed of glass wool encased in a wrapping material. The wrapping was damaged and heat affected where the insulation blanket was in contact with the APU bleed air duct. Damage to the wrapping exposed the inner glass wool material, which also showed evidence of having been affected by heat where the material was in contact with the bleed air duct. Engineering staff determined that the insulation blanket in contact with the bleed air duct was the likely source of the fumes."Damage to blanket at the lower side of the APU bleed air duct (Photo: ATSB/Virgin Australia):
A Delta Airlines Boeing 737-800, registration N3735D performing flight DL-483 from New York JFK,NY (USA) to Bridgetown (Barbados), was accelerating for takeoff from New York's runway 04L when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (more than 87 knots over ground) advising tower they needed to "look at something to check a couple of items". The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.A replacement Boeing 737-800 registration N394DA departed 6 hours later but needed to divert to Atlanta,GA (USA) for a crew change due to crew duty time limitation. N394DA reached Bridgetown with a total delay of 6.5 hours.A passenger reported the crew announced prior to commencing takeoff roll, they would accelerate the engines to takeoff thrust prior to brakes release causing the aircraft to shake a bit before brakes release. The aircraft subsequently began the departure roll but needed to reject takeoff stop at about 80-90 knots. The crew subsequently announced that they needed to reject takeoff because of a takeoff configuration alert starting to sound. The crew explained the engine acceleration prior to brakes release should have uncovered the takeoff configuration alert issue experienced on the previous flight, however, the alert did not occur until after the aircraft had been into the actual departure roll. Maintenance attempted to fix the problem for a couple of hours but unsuccessfully, a replacement aircraft was prepared and needed to stop in Atlanta for a crew change due to crew duty time limitation.
An ACT Airlines Boeing 747-400 freighter on behalf of Saudi Arabian Airlines, registration TC-ACJ performing flight SV-934 from Amsterdam (Netherlands) to Riyadh (Saudi Arabia), was accelerating for takeoff from Amsterdam's runway 09 when the crew rejected takeoff at about 80 knots reporting "all good, we have some braking problems". The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway.The occurrence aircraft was able to depart from runway 09 one hour later.
A TAAG Angola Airlines Boeing 737-700, registration D2-TBJ performing flight DT-241 from Luena to Luanda (Angola), had backtracked runway 29 and turned around to line up for takeoff from runway 29 when the nose gear sunk into a hole in the runway at about 07:15L (06:15Z), approximately at the line of runway threshold lights. The aircraft was disabled, the damage needs to be assessed.D2-TBJ stuck in the runway:
A Skywest Canadair CRJ-200 on behalf of United, registration N975SW performing flight OO-5530/UA-5530 from Winnipeg,MB (Canada) to Denver,CO (USA) with 50 people on board, had just become airborne after takeoff from Winnipeg's runway 31 when the crew reported smoke in the cabin, levelled off at 3000 feet and returned to Winnipeg for a safe landing on runway 31 about 10 minutes after departure.The Canadian TSB reported maintenance found no fault and suspected that de-icing fluid from the pre-departure application had entered the environmental system of the aircraft and caused the smoke. The aircraft was returned to service, departed again but needed to return a second time for the same reason.The aircraft departed again after about 5 hours on the ground but stopped the climb again at 3000 feet due to smoke in the cabin and returned to Toronto for a safe landing a second time.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/SKW5530/history/20150108/1445Z/CYWG/KDEN
A Kelowna Flightcraft Boeing 727-200, registration C-GKFJ performing freight flight KFA-273 from Hamilton,ON to Winnipeg,MB (Canada) with 3 crew, had been cleared for takeoff from Hamilton's runway 30 and was accelerating for takeoff, when tower instructed the aircraft to abort the takeoff and the crew rejected the takeoff at high speed. The aircraft came to a stop about halfway down the runway.The Canadian TSB reported that at the time of the takeoff clearance two snow ploughs were travelling from the end of the runway towards the threshold. The aircraft had already reached high speed when tower instructed the aircraft to abort takeoff and the aircraft came to a stop at about the midpoint of the 10,000 feet long runway. The TSB is currently assessing whether to open an investigation.Nav Canada reported KFA-273 was delayed by 5 minutes as result.On Jan 12th 2015 Canada's TSB released their final report releasing following findings:Findings as to causes and contributing factors- The blocked-runway indicator on the controllers extended computer display system display went unnoticed or unheeded, resulting in a take-off clearance being issued to KFA273 when the runway was not clear of vehicles.- During issuance of the take-off clearance, vehicles were observed on the runway, and the controller instructed the aircraft to stand by rather than using standard phraseology to cancel the take-off clearance.- The flight crew began to read back the take-off clearance before the controller released the push-to-talk button and, in doing so, did not hear the controllers instruction to stand by.- The controllers attention was focused on other tasks when KFA273 began the take-off roll, resulting in the aircraft movement going unnoticed for 22 seconds before the instruction to abort take-off was issued.- The air traffic control instruction to abort take-off, which was simultaneous with other sensory input and was not sufficiently compelling to alter the crews mental model of the situation or their expectation of an uneventful take-off, initially went unnoticed. As a result, the rejected take-off was not initiated until 9 seconds after the instruction.Findings as to risk- If personnel scheduling practices include counter-clockwise shift rotations and short shift changes, there is an increased risk of fatigue and performance impairments during night shifts occurring at the end of the shift rotation.- If the practice of working the combined airground position is employed for extended periods of time at night, there is an increased risk of controller errors due to fatigue.- If a blocked-runway indicator is routinely unheeded, there is an increased risk of aircraft being authorized to use a runway that is unavailable.- If airlines systematically plan flights with similar call signs to operate in close proximity to one another, there is an increased risk of call sign confusion.- If air traffic control transmissions are incomplete, not heard, or insufficiently compelling to alter the crews preconceived perception of the situation, then the risk is increased that the transmission will go unheeded.- If aircraft depart before the advisory times in the brake-cooling schedule, then there is an increased risk of brake overheating or tire fuse plug release.The TSB described the sequence of events:"The flight crew received take-off clearance while backtracking on Runway 30. Once the controller uttered the phrase cleared for take-off Runway 30, the PNF immediately pressed the PTT and read back the clearance, ending the transmission with 273. The remainder of the controllers transmission, which included the pause and instruction to stand by, was not heard by the flight crew. The simultaneous activation of the PTT in the cockpit will override any incoming transmissions. In a recording of the subsequent similar take-off clearance, the PNF responded by stating from the threshold cleared take-off 30, Flightcraft 273. The aircraft began its take-off roll at 0207:47. As the aircraft accelerated through 80 knots at 0208:09, the PNF made the standard call of 80 knots, and the PF responded 80 knots. At the same time, an approach chart clipped to the PFs control column fell off the clip, and both the PF and PNF were momentarily distracted. Also at this same time, the controller issued the instruction to abort take-off. At this point, KFA273 was approximately 1130 feet down the runway. The instruction to abort take-off went unrecognized for approximately 9 seconds. At 02:08:18 and approximately 2750 feet down the runway at an airspeed of 122 knots, the PNF of KFA273 saw bright white lights at the far end of the runway. Recognizing that the call to abort take-off was for them, the PNF informed the PF, and the crew initiated a rejected take-off (RTO). The airspeed peaked at approximately 130 knots before deceleration began. Initially during the RTO, the PF applied maximum braking; however, once it was apparent that the aircraft would stop well short of the snow sweepers, brake pressure was reduced to light braking. The aircraft was brought to a stop approximately 1700 feet following initiation of the RTO, at a position 4800 feet from the threshold and approximately 1200 feet short of the snow sweepers."The TSB reported the captain (approx. 6000 hours total, approx 3000 hours on type) was pilot flying and was assisted by the first officer (approx 2200 hours total, 800 hours on type) and a second officer (2250 hours total), crew fatigue was not considered a factor as all had been off work for a minimum of 2 days prior to the occurrence and reported on duty about 1.5 hours prior to the occurrence. Neither of the crew members had experienced a rejected takeoff except on simulators prior to the occurrence.The controller on duty at the occurrence had completed his day shift at 13:45L and returned to the midnight shift at 23:47L. The TSB stated: "Assuming a 45-minute commute each way to work, plus time for meals, personal hygiene, and any family and social responsibilities, the controller does not have an 8-hour opportunity for sleep between these 2 shifts. This shift pattern was observed 6 times during the 70 days preceding the occurrence." The TSB stated further: Based on known fatigue risk factors and the predicted sleep, the quantitative analysis showed low predicted effectiveness occurred during a large proportion of the night shifts. The following risk factors were noted:- Obtaining less than 8 hours of sleep in the previous 24 hours (sleep loss)- Accumulation of a sleep debt greater than 8 hours (sleep loss)- Time of day (circadian rhythm trough) and being out of phase (circadian rhythm de-synchronization).A qualitative analysis of the pattern of work/rest during this period identified the same risk factors and likely impact on performance.For the first 2:00 hours of his shift, prior to the occurrence, the workload had been light, in the 20 minutes prior to the occurrence the workload became higher with 4 departures requiring increased attention due to runway changes and clearance amendments due to weather. A second controller was available on recall, however, the controller did not assess the workload as high enough to call his collegue out. The TSB stated: "Both excessive workload and low levels of workload can result in decrements to controller performance. Overload can result in excessive demand on working memory and decrements in situational awareness, due to an inability to attend to all of the relevant information in the operating environment. This inability can lead to task shedding. Low levels of workload can produce similar effects by different means, since low levels of stimulation will result in vigilance decrements, which reduce the amount of attention to the operating environment. The importance of considering periods of low task demands has been described as follows: In many environments, it is the low levels of workload that, when coupled with boredom, fatigue, or sleep loss, can have negative implications for human performance."The TSB analysed: "While viewing the extended computer display system (EXCDS) display, which needed to be manipulated during the validation request, the blocked-runway indicators located directly below the aircrafts strip went unnoticed. The controller caught the call sign error while beginning a transmission to KFA273, informed the aircraft to stand by, and then corrected the error with the area control centre (ACC). The controller then issued a take-off clearance to KFA273. In doing so, and possibly distracted by the need to make the previous correction, the controller again did not detect the blocked-runway indicator while preforming the routine scan. Similarly, the practice of authorizing aircraft to arrive or depart on a runway for which a blocked-runway indicator is showing indicates a desensitization of the controller to the importance of the blocked-runway indicator, eliminating its effectiveness as a defence and increasing the risk of aircraft being authorized to use a runway that is unavailable. As the controller was completing the clearance, a visual scan of the runway surface detected the vehicles, and the controller paused and informed the aircraft to stand by. The Air Traffic Control Manual of Operations (ATC MANOPS) phraseology was not used to cancel the take-off clearance. It could not be determined whether using correct phraseology would have altered the outcome. The controller paused after the words cleared take-off Runway 30 were spoken. After this brief pause and without releasing the push-to-talk button (PTT), the controller then stated actually standby rather than the required phraseology (Take-off clearance cancelled). During the pause, the pilot not flying (PNF) on KFA273 assumed that the transmission was complete, depressed the aircrafts PTT and read back the clearance. When the controller eventually released the tower PTT, only the tail end of this transmission, which included the aircrafts call sign, was heard. As call signs alone are often used to acknowledge receipt of a transmission, the controller assumed that the aircraft understood the instruction to stand by and did not expect it to take off."The TSB analysed further: The flight crew, having not heard the portion of the transmission informing them to stand by, assumed that everything was normal, and began their take-off procedure.The controller then instructed the vehicles to exit the runway, briefly glanced at KFA273 to confirm that the aircraft wasnt rolling, and then focused on the Purolator Apron to issue taxi instructions to another Flightcraft aircraft. During this time, KFA273 began the take-off roll outside of the direct field of view of the controller. Immediately after the controller finished the taxi instructions, attention was returned to Runway 30, and the movement of KFA273 was noticed. The controller immediately instructed KFA273 to abort take-off.At the time of the instruction to abort take-off, KFA273 had just reached 80 knots. The PNF announced the speed, and the pilot flying (PF) confirmed. At the same time, a chart on the PFs pedestal fell and briefly distracted the crew. Apart from the brief distraction, the crew considered the take-off to be proceeding normally, as expected, and their forward view of the runway ahead presented no indication otherwise.That which is expected is a central factor that drives attention behavior and, as a result, cues that indicate that the situation is not as expected may not attract attention away from anticipated tasks. The implication is that situations will appear normal or familiar unless that which is out of the ordinary is of sufficient magnitude to attract attention and subsequent analysis.The cockpit environment was relatively noisy. The abort call was simultaneous with other sensory input, unexpected due to its rarity, and without supporting cues such as visual sighting of the obstacle. As a result, it was not sufficiently compelling to alter the crews mental model of the situation, or of their expectation of an uneventful take-off, and initially went unnoticed.As the aircraft began to crest the middle section of the runway, the crew began to notice unusual lights, and the PNF then recognized that the abort take-off call, issued 9 seconds earlier, had been intended for them. The crew rejected the take-off and brought the aircraft to a stop at a safe distance from the vehicles.Although the crew did consider the increased brake temperature following the rejected take-off (RTO), the brake-cooling schedule was not consulted and, as a result, the aircraft departed with an increased risk of brake overheating or tire fuse plug release.Metars:CYHM 190800Z 22017G22KT 8SM -SHRA OVC009 01/00 A2960 RMK SC8 SLP031 CYHM 190700Z 22017KT 5SM -SHRA BR OVC008 01/01 A2959 RMK SC8 SLP029 CYHM 190600Z 22018KT 5SM -SHRA BR FEW004 BKN009 OVC018 01/01 A2959 RMK SF2SC5SC1 SLP027 CYHM 190500Z 20018G23KT 5SM -SHRA BR OVC003 01/01 A2958 RMK SF8 SLP026 CYHM 190400Z 15007KT 4SM -SHRASN BR OVC004 00/00 A2960 RMK SF8 SLP034 CYHM 190300Z 11006KT 2 1/2SM -SHRASN BR OVC004 00/M00 A2962 RMK ST8 SLP042 CYHM 190231Z 10008KT 2 1/2SM -FZRA -SHSN BR OVC004 M00/M01 A2963 RMK SF8 SLP044CYHM 190200Z 10010KT 5SM -FZRA -SHSN OVC005 M00/M01 A2965 RMK SC8 SF ASOCTD SLP049 
A United Boeing 777-200, registration N78009 performing flight UA-44 from Newark,NJ (USA) to Brussels (Belgium), was accelerating for takeoff from Newark's runway 04L, tower reported winds from 320 degrees 24 knots gusting 33 knots, when the right hand engine (GE90) emitted a loud bang prompting the crew to reject takeoff at low speed reporting an engine failure, "roll the trucks". The aircraft stopped on the runway, emergency services responded, the crew requested emergency services to check the engines and inspect the runway. About 20 minutes after stopping the aircraft taxied to the apron with emergency services in trail.A passenger reported the right hand engine emitted a loud bang, then the brakes came on at a fairly low speed. After coming to a stop the captain announced they had an engine compressor stall. After stopping on the runway for about 20 minutes the aircraft taxied to the gate with emergency services following the aircraft. Passengers were rebooked onto UA-2098 the following day and are estimated to reach Brussels with a delay of 23 hours.The occurrence aircraft was able to resume service about 20 hours after rejecting takeoff.
A Martinair McDonnell Douglas MD-11 freighter, registration PH-MCR performing flight MP-1157 from Amsterdam (Netherlands) to Miami,FL (USA), was accelerating for a full length takeoff from Amsterdam's runway 18L when the crew rejected takeoff reporting a "minor reason" and vacated the runway via taxiway E2 (about 1200 meters/3900 feet down the runway).Back on ground frequency the crew reported they had rejected takeoff because of momentary "engine vib fail" (PW4462) that was probably caused by a bump on the intersection with runway 27 and queried, how long it would take until they could take off from a different runway, e.g. runway 24. Upon feedback by ground it would take about one hour the crew decided to try another takeoff from runway 18L and departed about 20 minutes after rejecting the first takeoff run and reached Miami about 15 minutes behind schedule.Rejected takeoff (Video: HamburgAirport):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Pr5dZicByw
An Air Transat Airbus A330-300, registration C-GKTS performing flight TS-905 from Varadero (Cuba) to Montreal,QC (Canada), was accelerating for takeoff when the crew rejected takeoff.The aircraft was able to depart about 90 minutes later.A passenger reported the aircraft was accelerating for takeoff and was about 20 seconds after the engines spooled up when the brakes came on. After the aircraft had stopped the crew announced they had received indication of an open cargo door, then the aircraft taxied to the apron where maintenance examined the door. The crew subsequently announced that the cargo door had been properly shut however a sensor was identified faulty, they needed to wait for another 30 minutes until the brakes had cooled down sufficiently. About 90 minutes after the rejected takeoff the aircraft departed and reached Montreal with a delay of 90 minutes.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/TSC905/history/20150104/0320Z/MUVR/CYUL
An Air Canada Rouge Airbus A319-100, registration C-FYNS performing flight AC-1865 from Orlando,FL (USA) to Toronto,ON (Canada) with 129 people on board, was accelerating through just below 100 knots over ground for takeoff from Orlando's runway 17R when the right hand engine (CFM56) ingested a bird, the crew felt a large vibration and yaw and observed the right hand engine had lost power. The crew rejected takeoff and slowed the aircraft, after stopping on the runway the right hand engine was shut down. The aircraft subsequently taxied to the apron.The flight was cancelled.The Canadian TSB reported on Jan 5th 2015, that the right hand engine ingested a Sandhill Crane (2.7 to 6.7kg, 6.0 to 14.7 lbs, height 80-127cm/2.6 to 4 feet, wingspan 165 to 229cm/5.4 to 7.5 feet) causing substantial damage to the fan blades. Maintenance replaced the damaged fan blades, balanced the fan and returned the aircraft to service.An adult and juvenile Sandhill Crane Crane (Photo: Tomfriedel):
A Loganair Saab 340B on behalf of Flybe, registration G-LGNL performing flight BE-6821 from Stornoway to Glasgow,SC (UK) with 25 passengers and 3 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Stornoway's runway 18 at about 08:33L (08:33Z) when the aircraft veered left off the runway and came to a stop on soft ground with the nose gear collapsed. Two passengers were taken to a hospital with minor injuries, two other passengers reported minor injuries, too, but declined assistance.The British AAIB have dispatched investigators on site and opened an investigation.The airport confirmed the outgoing aircraft operated by Loganair went off the runway at about 08:33L. Efforts to move the aircraft off the runway area are under way in order to resume normal airport operations later the day.The flight was cancelled.On Oct 8th 2015 the AAIB released their bulletin reporting that the aircraft taxied for a departure on runway 18 from taxiway A1. Tower reported the winds from 270 at 27 knots.The first officer, pilot monitoring, applied nearly full right aileron consistent with crosswind during line up, the captain (46, ATPL, 3,880 hours total, 3,599 hours on type), pilot flying, advanced the power levers, first officer instructed "autocoarsen high", and the engines accelerated symmetrically reaching 100% torque as the aircraft accelerated through 70 knots. During the early stages of the takeoff roll left rudder was applied and the aircraft maintained heading. With increasing speed the rudder was more and more centralised after which the aircraft made a slight turn to the left followed by a slight turn to the right, then a rapid change of heading to the left occurred, which was countered by right hand rudder which resulted in a slight heading change to the right however could not prevent the aircraft from exiting the left side of the runway leaving the paved surface at about 80 knots. The power levers remained at full power as the aircraft went over a disused runway and back onto grass, the nose gear collapsed in that process. The aircraft came to a stop about 38 meters off the left edge of the runway and about 250 meters past the point the aircraft had exited the runway.Both propellers were still turning, the first officer used the fire handles to shut the engines down.A passenger shouted the emergency exits should be opened immediately after the aircraft came to a stop, the propellers were still turning, cabin crew stopped the passengers because the propellers were still turning. As soon as the right hand propeller stopped a passenger opened the right hand overwing exit and the passengers left the aircraft through the exit, the left hand propeller was still turning.The AAIB summarized crew reported that during the initial stages of the takeoff roll the nose wheel steering was used to maintain the runway center line. When the captain felt they had sufficient rudder authority he moved his hand from the nose wheel steering wheel and the aircraft began to violently veer to the left. The captain could not recall whether takeoff was rejected and power levers were retarded.The AAIB analysed: During the attempted takeoff, the rudder was central from 40 kt and remained so until approximately 65 kt. Between approximately 52 and 65 kt, the aircraft turned right slightly before it turned left sharply at approximately 65 kt (Figure 3). Given that the rudder was central, this change of direction might have been caused by one, or a combination of the following factors:a. Differential brakingb. Asymmetric thrustc. A change in wind speed and directiond. A NWS input Data from the FDR showed that thrust was applied symmetrically throughout the takeoff run, and the manufacturer did not consider that the data for longitudinal acceleration and indicated airspeed supported the use of differential braking.The crew reported that the swing to the left took place at the handover of control, as the commander released the NWS control and moved his hands to the control yoke, and there might have been a change in NWS input as the nosewheel began to caster. However, because the rudder was in the neutral position and would have had no effect, any NWS input prior to the swing was probably in the turn left sense, to oppose the weathercock effect tending to turn the aircraft into the crosswind. In that case, any change in NWS input would have been in the wrong sense to cause a sharp swing to the left.It was possible that, immediately before the commander released the NWS control, there was a marked drop in the wind speed. In this case, the extant left NWS input would probably have been more than that required to counter the lower crosswind and the aircraft would have begun to turn left. However, this possibility could not be confirmed as there was no data to show whether or not the aircraft had actually experienced a marked change in wind speed or direction. As the aircraft moved towards the edge of the runway, the pilot applied right rudder in an attempt to return to the runway centreline. Figure 2 shows that, with the aircraft still on the runway, the nose of the aircraft began to turn right in response to the rudder input but the main landing gear maintained their track towards the runway edge. The track of the nose landing gear moved towards that of the right landing gear, indicating that the aircraft was skidding left as it departed the paved surface.Metars:EGPO 021020Z 26021KT 9999 VCSH FEW015CB SCT020 04/01 Q1010 EGPO 020950Z 26017KT 9999 VCSH FEW015CB SCT020 03/01 Q1010 EGPO 020920Z 27022G33KT 9999 VCSH SCT015CB BKN020 05/01 Q1009 EGPO 020850Z 26018KT 9999 VCSH FEW015CB SCT018 05/01 Q1009 EGPO 020820Z 27022G33KT 9999 VCSH FEW015CB SCT040 05/01 Q1008 EGPO 020750Z 27019KT 9999 VCSH FEW015CB SCT042 05/02 Q1007 EGPO 020720Z 27024G36KT 9999 VCSH FEW015CB 05/00 Q1006 EGPO 020650Z 27022KT 9999 VCSH FEW015CB 07/02 Q1005 EGPO 020620Z 27021G32KT 9999 VCSH FEW015CB SCT041 05/02 Q1005 EGPO 020550Z AUTO 27022KT 9999 FEW036/// 05/02 Q1004EGPO 020520Z AUTO 26027G41KT 9999 FEW024/// 04/02 Q1003 EGPO 020450Z AUTO 26026G44KT 7000 -SHRA FEW019/// 04/02 Q1003 EGPO 020420Z AUTO 26016KT 9999 -SHRA FEW014/// SCT026/// 04/02 Q1002EGPO 020350Z AUTO 26018KT 9999 NCD 04/01 Q1002 Aerial overview of accident site (Photo: AAIB):The aircraft off the runway (Photo: Donald J MacDonald):Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):

An American Airlines Boeing 777-200, registration N751AN performing flight AA-900 from Buenos Aires Ezeiza,BA (Argentina) to Miami,FL (USA) with 246 passengers and 14 crew, rejected takeoff from Buenos Aires at low speed (about 50 knots) when the crew received a cargo door indication. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.Argentina's JIAAC reported the the left hand engine's (Trent 892) tail cone had detached.On Dec 1st 2014 Argentina's JIAAC released their final report in Spanish concluding the probable cause of the incident was:During acceleration for takeoff the warning light for the forward cargo door illuminated prompting the crew to reject takeoff. The crew subsequently taxied the aircraft to the apron, where the loss of the left hand engine's tail cone was discovered as result of the fracture of the casing of a bearing which caused a pressure increase within and subsequent detachment of the cone.Following the rejected takeoff, while N751AN was taxiing to the apron, the crew of another aircraft reported a metallic object near the runway. A runway inspection recovered the object which was subsequently identified as the tail cone of an engine belonging to the Boeing 777-200. At that time it had already been discovered that the left hand engine's tail cone was missing on N751AN. A visual inspection of the left hand engine revealed evidence of loss of oil.The JIAAC reported that the detachment of the tail cone did not cause any "collateral damage". The left hand engine had been installed on the occurrence aircraft in November 2010 and had since accumualted 6,744 flight hours in 791 flight cycles.The JIAAC reported that vaporized oil originated from a pressure line, together with hot gasses the vaporized oil exited through a hole of about 1.5mm in the casing of a bearing into the tail cone of the left hand engine causing a pressure increase there, that caused deformation on fastening holes and screws and eventually resulted in the detachment of the engine's tail cone.There had been no history of similiar failures. The design also did not cater for the possibility of the detachment of the engine's tail cone, therefore no related indication existed.Editorial note: the report does not touch of why and how the forward cargo door indication occurred, which prompted the rejected takeoff.
A Jazz Aviation Canadair CRJ-705 operating as Air Canada Express, registration C-GNJZ performing flight QK-8902/AC-8902 from Toronto,ON (Canada) to New York JFK,NY (USA) with 64 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Toronto's runway 24R when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 50 knots) due to nose wheel vibrations and the aircraft pulling to the right.

A Delta Airlines Douglas DC-9-50, registration N676MC performing flight DL-2272 from Atlanta,GA to Pittsburgh,PA (USA), was accelerating through about 80 knots for takeoff from Atlanta when the right hand engine (JT8D) emitted a loud bang and the aircraft shuddered. The crew rejected takeoff, the airplane slowed safely and came to a stop on the runway, however was disabled due to the brakes locking up. The passengers deplaned and were bussed to the terminal.The NTSB reported the right hand engine had suffered an uncontained failure. The #2 engine cowling was found penetrated and three small holes were found in the engine causing. An impact scar was found on the outer pane of a cabin window on the right hand side forward of the engine. One fan blade was found separated below the platform.On Nov 19th 2014 the NTSB released their final report concluding the probable cause of the incident was:The probable cause of the No. 2 engine failure and subsequent aborted takeoff was the high cycle fatigue failure of a fan blade near the blade root that resulted in extensive low pressure compressor damage and compressor case breach.The NTSB reported: "Metallurgical analysis concluded that the separated fan blade failed due to a high cycle fatigue crack that originated approximately 0.9375 inch aft of the leading edge on the suction side of the blade. Replicas (molds) were taken on six fan blades at points along the leading edge that were undamaged during the event and then superimposed over a representative new fan blade profile to measure leading edge erosion. Four of the six replicas were taken at blade chord positions that are repairable in accordance with the JT8D-17 repair manual. The measurements collected from the four replicas confirmed that all four had material loss within allowable limits, but three of the four blades had chord loss greater than P&W's erosion estimate of 0.035 inches for engines that had accumulated 11,000 engine cycles. The erosion estimates were created using field data from P&W PW4000 series engines which has the same fan blade material as the JT8D-17."The damage to the fan rotor (Photo: NTSB):The penetration of the upper engine cowling (Photo: NTSB):The puncture of the compressor case (Photo: NTSB):

A Delta Airlines Boeing 757-200, registration N553NW performing flight DL-2210 from Atlanta,GA to Dallas Ft. Worth,TX (USA) with 182 people on board, rejected takeoff from Atlanta at low speed (about 60 KIAS) after a loud bang was heard and the left hand engine's (PW2037) fire indication activated. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron, where passengers disembarked normally.The NTSB reported on Nov 9th 2011 that the left hand engine's diffuser was found ruptured. The engine has been replaced, the damaged engine was disassembled and parts were taken to the NTSB laboratories for further examination.On Oct 24th 2014 the NTSB released their final report concluding the probable cause of the incident was:the return to service of overhauled airplane engine parts with undetected fatigue cracks, resulting in complete loss of engine power and uncontained engine failure. A contributing factor was the inadequate diffuser and HPT case inspection procedure.The NTSB reported that as result of the uncontained engine failure there were numerous dents and impact marks on the leading edge and underside of the left wing, both halves of the engine core cowl were significantly distorted and could be freely rotated until hitting the wing, the wing impact marks were consistent with the core cowls hitting the wing.The NTSB described the diffuser damage: "The engine diffuser case, high pressure turbine (HPT) case, and nozzle guide vane (NGV) support joint, referred to as the "M-flange," were fractured at a bolt hole located at 12 o'clock (BH1). A longitudinal fracture extended from BH1 about 15 inches forward into the diffuser case and about 2.5 inches aft into the HPT case. There was a 270° circumferential fracture in the diffuser case about 15 inches forward of the M-flange, and a 120° circumferential fracture in the HPT case about 2.5 inches aft of the M-flange; an approximately 15-inch-wide section of the diffuser case, along with fractured segments of the HPT case and NGV support attached at the M-flange, had unwrapped from the right side of the engine. The engine was disassembled and the diffuser case, NGV support, and HPT case were shipped to the NTSB materials lab for further investigation."Metallurgical examination revealed low cycle fatigue cracks had developed in all three components at the M-flange bolt hole, it was determined that the cracks developed through the HPT case over the last 7,305/7,380 cycles, the cracks in the diffuser case over the last 2,471 and 5,159 cycles. According to the technical documentation the components had last undergone an inspection for cracks 3,479 cycles before the failure, no cracks were permitted during such inspections. The NTSB could not determine why the inspection had been that ineffective, the maintenance facility had been closed in August 2011. As result of the investigation the FAA released an air worthiness directive to have another 50 engines having been identified to go through those checks in the maintenance facility, to be checked for cracks, no additional cracks were found.

A Qantas Boeing 737-800, registration VH-VZO performing flight QF-719 from Canberra,AC to Perth,WA (Australia) with 150 passengers, was accelerating for takeoff from Canberra's runway 35 using an unusual takeoff configuration of flaps at 1 degrees due to a near max takeoff weight departure. When the aircraft reached Vr the captain, pilot flying, attempted to rotate the aircraft but needed excessive control force as the aircraft appeared nose heavy. Being aware of the possibility of a tail strike if too much back force was being applied to the yoke, the captain applied more than normal firm backpressure to ease the aircraft into the air, the aircraft exceeded V2 by more than 25 knots as it became airborne and climbed out a faster airspeed than normal and below required climb gradient but without loss of terrain/obstacle clearance. After being established in the initial climb the captain trimmed the aircraft to ease the backpressure, a brief discussion amongst the captain and first officer occurred suggesting the unusual back pressure might have been the result of the flaps 1 configuration and the group of children amongst the passengers. The crew continued the flight normally for a safe landing in Perth about 4.5 hours later.The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) released their brief final report releasing following safety message:The ATSB SafetyWatch highlights the broad safety concerns that come out of our investigation findings and from the occurrence data reported to us by industry. One of the safety concerns is data input errors. In this incident, the crew entered and checked the data supplied to them, however the original passenger weight data at check-in was not accurate. Determining accurate weight and balance is required for all aircraft prior to flight. Use of an incorrect trim setting for the aircrafts actual weight and balance may adversely affect the aircrafts controllability during flight. In larger aircraft, automated systems have been designed to replace manual processes for calculating the aircrafts weight and balance. Validation of the data entered into these systems is essential to ensure accurate loading information is provided to flight crew.The ATSB reported that amongst the 150 passengers there was a group of 87 primary school children, who were seated together in the aft cabin. However, all passengers had been checked in using the standard adult weight of 87kg per person. As a result, the loadsheet overstated the takeoff weight by about 3.5 to 5 tons (7700 to 11000lbs) and put the takeoff stabilizer trim off correct setting by about one unit. The weight discrepancy would have resulted in a Vref of about 1-2 knots less on approach to Perth as well, however, no anomaly occurred during the approach.The ATSB reported that the group of children had been pre checked two days before the flight accepting e-mail via the group check in facilities. The fields for young children and children was left blank in that e-mail, the agent receiving and processing the e-mail assumed all members of the group were adults. The weight to be assigned to primary school children of 32kg per child was thus not applied to any of the passengers.The ATSB also stated that the gate agents were not able to modify the weight of passengers/change passenger category from adult to child or vice versa once the passenger had already been checked in.The airline as well as Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Agency took a safety action each as result of the occurrence.
A Singapore Airlines Boeing 777-200, registration 9V-SVH performing flight SQ-282 from Auckland (New Zealand) to Singapore (Singapore), was accelerating for takeoff from Auckland's runway 05R when a loud bang was heard in the cockpit and cabin prompting the crew to reject takeoff at high speed.

A Jetstar Pacific Airbus A320-200, registration VN-A198 performing flight BL-595 from Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam), was cleared for takeoff from Da Nang's runway 17L.However, a Vietnam Airlines Airbus A321-200, registration VN-A356 performing flight VN-130 from Ho Chi Minh City to Da Nang (Vietnam), had just landed on runway 17L and was still in the landing roll only about to vacate the runway, when the takeoff clearance was issued. The crew immediately complained to tower and made their presence known, tower cancelled the takeoff clearance about 4 seconds after that transmission.Vietnam's Civil Aviation Authority (CAAV) reported, that the tower was occupied by a trainee at that time, the supervising controller had left his position at the time so that the trainee was alone at that time.The CAAV concluded the causes of the serious incident were:- The trainee did not check the runway before issuing the takeoff clearance. - The tower was not staffed with licensed air traffic controllersThe CAAV reported the license of the supervising controller has been revoked.The trainee has been prohibited to receive his license before Jul 11th 2015 and has to undergo additional training.The Air Traffic Management Company and their regional manager were reprimanded for permitting a trainee on the tower unsupervised. The regional manager was suspended for 15 days.The crew of Vietnam Airline's A321 were reprimanded for violating the requirement to report a safety relevant incident within 72 hours.
A Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800, registration UR-PSA performing flight PS-373 from Kiev (Ukraine) to Dubai (United Arab Emirates) with 167 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Kiev Borispol Airport's runway 36R when one of the left hand main tyres blew below V1. The crew continued takeoff and decided to continue to Dubai. The aircraft performed a low approach to Dubai's runway 12R about 4.5 hours after departure to have the gear inspected from the ground, then positioned for another approach. Upon touchdown on Dubai's runway 12L about 4:50 hours after departure the aircraft burst the second left main tyre. The aircraft came to a safe stop on the runway but was disabled.Ukraine's State Aviation Service reported in their monthly bulletin that Authorities of the United Arab Emirates are investigating the occurrence involving both right hand main gear tyres being blown.The aircraft resumed service on Nov 8th 2013.On Jul 15th 2014 United Arab Emirates' General Civil Aviation Administration (GCAA) released their final report concluding the probable causes of the occurrence, rated a serious incident by GCAA, were:The Air Accident Investigation Sector determines that the causes of the prolonged runway closure by this disabled aircraft were:- The No.2 wheel tire burst on takeoff leading to the No.1 tire burst after landing.- The tire burst on takeoff, was most probably, due to impact with an object on the take-off runway.- The inadequate disabled Aircraft recovery plan.- Lack of training and inefficient decision-making.Contributing Factors to the IncidentContributing factor to the Serious Incident was the insufficient communication network between the departure airport, the Operations Control Centre (OCC), Maintenance Control Centre (MCC), and the Aircraft, and lack of cockpit tire pressure indications, which deprived the crew from identifying which tire had burst and then practice a possible mitigating landing technique.The GCAA reported that the aircraft departed Kiev's runway 36R, the computed reference speeds were: V1=153 KIAS, Vr=159 KIAS for a takeoff weight of 74,298kg (163,800 lbs). While the aircraft accelerated through 140 KIAS the crew heard a loud bang, the captain later described it like the sound of a car accident, the first officer like the sound of an engine failure on the full flight simulator, the crew continued takeoff, the nose gear became airborne at 160 KCAS and the main gear became airborne at 172 KCAS. After the initial climb, at 1270 feet AGL, the crew informed ATC to check the runway, they might have hit a center line light and there might be debris on the runway. The purser reported to the flight deck that a number of passengers were worried about the sound that had occurred during the takeoff run.About 11 minutes after the crew had advised to check the runway ATC reported that fragments of a tyre had been found on the runway. The crew agreed, they had the same impression, and they would check and report later. ATC suggested that the fragments might be a tyre cap and queried whether the parts would really belong to the aircraft. A request by the crew to check whether the fragments belonged to a nose or main tyre was not responded to.After consulting with the quick reference manual and the flight crew operating manual the captain decided to continue the flight to Dubai. Upon approach the crew requested a low approach and ground service to check the right main gear tyres for any blown tyre. Following the overflight ground services reported that all gear was down and appeared okay. The aircraft positioned for another approach and landing.Upon touch down on Dubai's runway 12L, three green lights indicated gear was down and locked, a vibration was felt throughout the aircraft and the aircraft tended to drift to the left. The aircraft slowed and turned into high speed exit M9 but came to a stop disabled with the tail of the aircraft still within the runway protected area. The aircraft's both left main gear tyres were blown and had separated causing the aircraft to roll on the wheel rims.About 50 minutes after the aircraft came to a stop, after the passengers had disembarked onto the taxiway, the aircraft recovery services were called to remove the aircraft from the runway.The GCAA then described the recovery efforts in the section portraying the factual findings: About 30 minutes elapsed before an aircraft jack requested from a third party4 operator arrived. The recovery team tried to position the jack underneath the LH MLG support point but the jack could not be positioned due to insufficient height being available.About 45 minutes after the first attempt to jack the Aircraft a bottle jack and one main axle wheel jack were supplied to the recovery team. The axle wheel jack was also higher than the available space. Accordingly, the recovery team had no other alternative than to use the bottle jack to raise the LH MLG in order replace the wheels.The recovery team positioned the bottle jack underneath the LH MLG support point and started to lift the gear but, due to the concentrated load of the bottle jack on the tarmac, the latter could not withstand the pressure and the taxiway surface was damaged allowing the base of the jack to sink. The recovery team discontinued the attempt and tried to find another solution.At this time, except for the passengers who had been disembarked earlier, the Aircraft was still loaded with cargo and the remaining fuel.After more than one unsuccessful attempt to jack the Aircraft and change the affected wheels, the recovery team requested main Boeing 737 jacks from the same third party operator. About another 45 minutes were spent waiting for the main jacks to arrive. Upon the arrival of the jacks the recovery team positioned the LH jack at its location on the lower surface of the LH wing and began to lift the Aircraft. However, instead of lifting the LH side of the Aircraft, the nose started to lift. The recovery team repeated the attempts with no success until 0248 when the ODMA gave instructions to move the Aircraft immediately and by any means possible.Subsequently, the recovery team connected the tow bar to the Aircraft nose gear and towing tractor and then waited about 40 minutes for the tractor driver who was employed by the Airport's Ground Handler. Later, the Aircraft was towed on its deflated LH MLG wheels' tires for about 200 meters to vacate the runway.The GCAA stated the aircraft received damage to:- both left hand main gear tyres- #1 and #2 wheels and brakes- MLG lower side strut doors control fitting broke- #1 leading edge flap- wing to body fairing- missing MLG doors- #6 spoiler- MLG tubes and hoses- #1 engine fire extinguisher tube- #1 engine thrust reverser cowl- wheel well bonded panel- trailing edge inboard flap- fuselage skin panels at various positionsThe runway received shallow grooves and initial turn off, the taxiway sustained localized ground break up and grooves due to the loading bottle jack contentrated load.The GCAA analysed: "The shape of the recovered pieces of the No.2 tire showed indications of sharp cuts due, most probably, to contact with a foreign object. The Investigation believes that the foreign object was on the departure runway as evidenced by the crew's request to ATC to check whether there was debris left after the departure. Moreover, the recovered pieces showed a separation at the casing plies at about 30% of the casing total plies from the outside. The tire manufacturer's laboratory examination concluded that, it is, most probably, that casing separation was caused by a sudden mechanical rupture. The identified suspected cut of the casing plies that was observed on the debris supported the probability of foreign object impact. The tread was still bonded to the casing which provided an indication that the tread separation was not caused by any production anomaly." and subsequently continued: "The laboratory examination of No. 2 tire showed that the footprint of the remaining tire debris had signs of overload which was mainly the result of an underinflated condition. Although the underinflated No. 2 tire did not contribute to the tire burst, the Investigation believes that the Operator did not have an adequate system to monitor the tire pressure leading to an undetected underinflated tire. The Investigation was unable to obtain information relevant to the Operator's tire storage conditions, but the Investigation believes that, if followed properly, the tire storage conditions and procedures as laid down in the Operator's Technical Procedures Manual are efficient in keeping tires reliable."The GCAA analysed: "After the request by the crew to Kiev ATC to check the departure runway for any foreign debris left by the Aircraft, the crew were advised that pieces of tire had been found on the runway. Neither the OCC, nor the MCC, had a role in identifying the collected tire pieces and then relaying the information relative to the position of the burst tire to the crew. This information would have enabled the crew to manage the landing by employing an effective modified landing technique. The Investigation believes that the communication network between the departure airport, the OCC, the MCC and the Aircraft was not effective."The GCAA continued: "The decision of the captain to continue the flight was justified in that, "There were adverse weather conditions at the departure airport; the FCTM and OM-B recommend flight crew to continue the flight; the damage was confined to a single tire [according to the captain's assumption]; the company had advised to continue the flight; the take-off weight was very high; and there was no problem indicated in the cockpit". Although there is nothing in the standards that can limit the captain's judgment of continuing the flight to the destination airport, the Investigation believes that the decision to continue the flight had introduced an operational hazard at the destination airport."The GCAA analysed: "The crew mistakenly requested visual inspection of the RH MLG due to their inadequate appreciation of the state of the damaged MLG. The ODMA did not notice any abnormal condition on the RH MLG nor did he inspect the affected LH MLG since the crew had not requested this. According to international standards an 'Inspection Fly-Past' is usually requested by the crew and an external visual check is carried out by Airport Operations personnel11. The erroneous message that was transmitted by the captain to the Tower Controller deprived the Airside Operations personnel of paying any attention to the affected LH MLG. It is probable that the damage to the tire could have been identified."The sharp cut in the #2 tyre tread (Photo: GCAA):

A Delta Airlines Boeing 737-800, flight DL-2483 from Las Vegas,NV to Atlanta,GA (USA) with 160 passengers and 6 crew, had been cleared for immediate takeoff from Las Vegas' runway 25R at 14:32L (21:32Z). The aircraft was accelerating for takeoff when tower cancelled the takeoff clearance about 40 seconds after the clearance for takeoff. The aircraft rejected takeoff at high speed, slowed safely and vacated the runway via taxiway A5 about 7500 feet/2250 meters down the runway. The aircraft returned to the apron.A replacement Boeing 737-800 registration N3757D reached Atlanta with a delay of 6:40 hours.The FAA reported a private aircraft was on approach to a crossing runway prompting the air traffic controller to cancel the takeoff clearance as a precaution. Preliminary review of the radar data showed however that there was no conflict even if the takeoff had continued.
A KLM Cityhopper Embraer ERJ-190, registration PH-EZL performing flight KL-1315 from Amsterdam (Netherlands) to Bordeaux (France), had been instructed to line up for departure from runway 09 and was waiting for takeoff clearance when the crew reported they had a "little fire" in one of the galleys, no assistance was needed, but they wanted to vacate the runway. The aircraft taxied clear of the runway and stopped at the adjacent taxiway. Emergency services responded, the crew indicated everything had returned to normal but they would return to the gate.A replacement Embraer ERJ-190 registration PH-EZH reached Bordeaux with a delay of 3 hours.
The crew of an Avianca Fokker 100, registration HK-4488 performing flight AV-181 from Bogota (Colombia) to Guayaquil (Ecuador) with 91 passengers and 5 crew, reported gear trouble shortly after takeoff from Bogota and entered a holding to trouble shoot the problem. The airplane subsequently returned to Bogota for a safe landing on runway 13R about one hour after departure. 5 passengers needed medical attention due to anxiety attacks.The Colombian CAA reported, that the airplane actually experienced an electrical problem resulting in the gear indication.The NTSB reported on Sep 25th that the airplane endured a hard landing while landing in Bogota resulting in no injuries and minor damage to the aircraft. The Colombian CAA have requested assistance in decoding the flight data recorder from the NTSB laboraties.In 2014 Colombia's Civil Aviation Authority (CCAA) released their final report in Spanish concluding the probable causes of the accident were:Excessive vibration of the landing gear during rotation caused the torque damper link fixation pins to shear.The CCAA reported the crew, the captain was pilot monitoring and the first officer pilot flying, was rotating for takeoff from Bogota's runway 13L when excessive vibrations were felt prompting the captain to take control of the aircraft. Climbing through 400 feet the commander ordered "gear up", however, the landing gear lever was locked into the extended position and the landing gear remained extended. A burning smell developed on the flight deck. The crew decided to immediately return to Bogota, however, working the checklists and detecting the anti-skid would not be available the crew decided to enter a hold to assess the situation with dispatch, maintenance and ATC.The aircraft subsequently landed on runway 13R, after lowering the nose gear onto the runway the vibrations re-occurred, the crew operated the brakes and slowed the aircraft maintaining runway center line with the brakes, however, as the speed reduced the aircraft started to drift left about abeam taxiway T despite right rudder and right nose wheel steering input and the aircraft turning to the right. The aircraft came to a stop within the runway at a heading of about 180 degrees about 200 meters from taxiway D. 12 passengers required medical attention, however, there were no injuries. The aircraft sustained substantial damage to both its main landing gear struts, both main wheel assemblies were found rotated around the gear strut by about 90 degrees, the torque damper links and upper torque links were found broken on both main landing gear struts, brakes assembly lines were found damaged.The runway had been contaminated with tyre rubber as well as hydraulic fluid and oil. The contamination was removed by emergency services.The CCAA reported that after departure the crew received indication of the GND/FLT switch having failed as well as an anti-skid failure. The CCAA reported that a hard landing inspection found no structural damage (except for main landing gear). Minor damage was found at a number of systems as result of the severe vibrations enduring during the takeoff rotation and the landing roll. A leak at the nose gear's shimmy damper was identified, the shimmy damper was removed.The CCAA reported that the torque link dampers installed on both main landing gear struts had accumulated 10,939 cycles with a TBO of 12,000 cycles. The aircraft had undergone its last C-Check between November 20th 2009 and December 9th 2009, the last check of the Torque Damper Link oil levers was on Apr 15th 2010. The aircraft had encountered vibrations from the nose gear prompting the replacement of the nose wheels on Apr 24th 2010. The CCAA analysed that the takeoff rotation commenced at 161 KIAS (187 knots over ground) to 165 KIAS (192 knots over ground), the tyre limiting speed was 195 knots, the takeoff thus remained within permitted limits, although it had been recommended by an operational bulletin to use different takeoff configurations at high altitude airports to achieve lower takeoff speeds. The operator had been authorized to use higher takeoff weights resulting in increased takeoff speeds. Without declaring emergency the crew returned to Bogota, received takeoff configuration alerts all the way to landing without possibility to silence the alarms, used flaps 42 for landing. After main gear touch down and subsequent nose gear touchdown the vibrations re-occurred, the crew maintained control until the aircraft had slowed and the aircraft began to drift left while turning clockwise at the same time. The aircraft came to a stop on the runway, was shut down and evacuated. The CCAA analysed that the crew worked all relevant checklists and procedures related to the departure vibrations and locked gear handle fulfilling all requirements of standard operating procedures.The CCAA analysed weather, ATC, aerodrome and communication were not factors into the occurrence.The CCAA analysed that the vibrations encountered during the takeoff run came from the nose gear and re-occurred after the aircraft had touched down with the nose gear. The source of the vibration could not be established by the investigation. However, the nose wheel vibrations caused the fixation pins on the main gear to shear as result of an overload in the cross section with no prior fatigue cracks or damage.Tracks on the runway (Photo: CCAA):The main wheel positions after landing (Photo: CCAA):
An Avianca Brazil (formerly known as Oceanair) Fokker 100, registration PR-OAD performing flight O6-6151 from Brasilia,DF to Belo Horizonte,MG (Brazil) with 95 passengers and 5 crew, experienced strong vibration during the takeoff roll, which stopped after liftoff. The airplane returned to Brasilia, where the airplane touched down and immediately encountered strong vibrations again. The airplane turned right just before coming to a stop. The airplane was shut down on the runway, the passengers disembarked onto the runway. The aircraft sustained substantial damage to its landing gear.Passenger Luis Flavio Esteves reported, that upon leaving the aircraft he noticed the right hand main gear tyres and wheels were damaged.The German BFU reported on Jul 19th 2010, that they are participating in the investigation according to ICAO Annex 13. The BFU reported, that during the takeoff run there were serious vibrations. After lift off the gear could not be retracted forcing the crew to return to Brasilia. During landing roll the brakes did not work, the airplane came to a stop just short of the runway end.In 2014 Brazil's CENIPA released their final report in Portugese concluding the probable causes of the accident were:- Maintenance of aircraft: During maintenance procedures within the operator to replace components of the torque link dampers, required spacers were not installed as specified in the maintenance manual AMM 0100 Fokker 70/100, Task 32-11-10-400-814-B, item 8, Subtask 32-11-10-420-014-B00, item "G ".- Management Oversight: Although sufficient training and adequate equipment was available to the maintenance supervisors, they were not able to identify the lack of installation of spacers as described in the AMM.CENIPA reported that during the takeoff run, close to the speed to rotate the aircraft, the crew noticed strong vibration of the airframe. After becoming airborne the landing gear lever was locked in the extended position and the crew received indication "GND/FLT CONTROL SWITCH". The crew, a captain in supervision in the left hand seat being pilot flying and a training captain in the right hand seat assuming the role of pilot monitoring, elected to return, during the roll out at about 100 knots the vibrations re-occurred even more intense than before followed by the loss of brakes and loss of directional control. The aircraft came to a stop on the runway close to the runway end with substantial damage to both main landing gear struts including tyres, wheels, brakes, shock absorbers and strut structure as well as minor damage to the trailing edge flap panels. There were no injuries.CENIPA reported both main landing gear struts were removed from the aircraft and sent to Fokker Services in the Netherlands for further laboratory examination. The examination found that in both main gear struts spacers were missing in the assembly of Link Torque Dampers leading to a gap of about 4.5mm in the Torque Damper Link, that progressively increased over time as result of vibrations and culminated in the fixation pin securing the assembly in its correct position to the gear leg shearing off and permitting the wheels to rotate freely at 360 degrees around the main gear leg causing damage to the tyres, wheels, brakes and hydraulic lines. All other components of the gear struts were found within standards and requirements of normal operation and maintenance. All damage found was identified consistent with the effects encountered during the landing roll in Brasilia.CENIPA analysed that the Link Torque Dampers had 12,000 cycles permited between overhaul. As result the aircraft needed the Link Torque Dampers replaced, the work was performed on Apr 22th 2010 on this aircraft, it was the very first time in the company of such an overhaul and thus a novelty to the mechanics involved.

A Malaysia Airlines Boeing 737-800, registration 9M-MXJ performing flight MH-192 from Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) to Bangalore (India) with 159 passengers and 7 crew, burst tyres on its right main landing gear during takeoff from Kuala Lumpur's runway 32R, stopped the climb at 14,000 feet and decided to return to Kuala Lumpur. After working checklists the crew requested a low approach to Kuala Lumpur to verify whether the right hand main landing gear was down. The aircraft made a low approach to runway 32L. Following the low approach the crew was informed that the right hand main gear did not appear to be in the correct position. The airport began to prepare for a partial gear up landing and the crew prepared the cabin for the emergency landing. The aircraft entered a holding at 5000 and 7000 feet to burn off fuel for about 140 minutes, then the crew requested another low approach to runway 32L. Following that last low approach the crew declared PAN. After checking when the airport would be ready to receive them for the landing, approach control indicated they would advise, in response the captain declared Mayday reporting low fuel. The aircraft landed safely and normally on runway 32L and came to a safe stop about 3.5 hours after departure, there were no injuries. The inboard right main gear tyre was found burst.Emergency services reported the aircraft landed normally and safely, only one landing gear malfunctioned. The runway had not been foamed. The passengers disembarked normally.Malaysia's DGCA reported while the aircraft was still holding to burn off fuel, the aircraft would need to perform a belly landing and would land with as little fuel as possible.The airline confirmed the right hand landing gear malfunctioned forcing the crew to return to Kuala Lumpur for an emergency landing. The aircraft landed safely.On Apr 23rd 2014 Malaysia's Minister of Transport reported during a press conference related to missing flight MH-370, that the crew of MH-192 felt heavy vibrations during the takeoff run. MH-2626 lining up the runway for departure reported seeing tyre debris. Short time later the crew MH-192 reported they might have burst a tyre on departure. The aircraft made a low approach, then re-entered the hold for about 110 minutes before a second low approach was being conducted followed by a safe landing. The #3 tyre (inboard right main gear) was found burst.The safe landing (Video: Aves Liaw):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYsrirJG474Tyre debris recovered from departure runway 32R (Photo: i-man):

A Jet2.com Boeing 757-200, registration G-LSAN performing flight LS-933 from Manchester,EN (UK) to Salzburg (Austria), was accelerating the engines (RB211) for takeoff from Manchester's runway 23R when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed and returned to the apron.A replacement Boeing 757-200 registration G-LSAI reached Salzburg with a delay of 2:45 hours.A passenger reported the crew announced problems with the left hand engine as reason for the rejected takeoff.G-LSAN was able to resume service about 24 hours later.
A Titan Airways Boeing 737-300 freighter, registration G-POWC performing freight flight AWC-16V from Edinburgh,SC to London Stansted,EN (UK) with 3 crew, was accelerating for takeoff when after reaching Vr (128 KIAS) the captain needed to apply much more than normal back pressure on the yoke to achieve a slow rotation. The aircraft became airborne and a nose up attitude of 15 degrees was achieved for climb out. The crew noticed that approximately 1 to 1.5 more units of nose up pitch trim units than normal were needed. As the aircraft was handling normally otherwise the crew decided to continue the flight to destination. During the approach the crew again noticed that more than usual nose up pitch trim was needed. Following safe landing the commander went to open the doors and check the unit load devices (ULD) and found they had been loaded in reversed order to the load manifest.The AAIB released their preliminary report as part of their monthy bulletin released on Apr 10th 2014 stating, that the loading of the aircraft was done by a contractor. The captain, upon arriving at the aircraft, had seen the ULDs besides the aircraft and seen, they were in the right order. The crew was not required to check the loading, however, the operator's operations manual stated that a final check can be carried out to verify that the last ULD was in the last position at bay A and no in the first position at bay H. The commander stated that due to the late arrival of load and fuel the check was omitted.While the load manifest showed the ULDs in the correct order, the ULDs were loaded onto the aircraft in the wrong order inadvertently. This resulted in the CG being forward of the flight envelope limits. The CG index with the cargo loaded in correct order would have been 38.8 units, the forward limit was 16 units, the actual index with the cargo loaded in reversed order was 3.8 units.The flight data recorder showed, that with a computed Vr at 128 KIAS first nose up inputs were made at 133 to 137 KIAS, the first rotation began at 141 KIAS, the rotation achieved 1 degree/second rate (normal 3 degrees/second) until reaching 15 degrees nose up.The AAIB analysed: "The ULDs were loaded in the reverse order to that intended. As a result, the CG of the aircraft was forward of the flight envelope limit. With pitch trim preset to that required for the intended loading configuration, the handling pilot experienced greater than expected control column forces on rotation, which resulted in a slow and delayed rotation. During the flight, the pitch trim required was more nose up than usual to achieve trimmed flight. The Load Order Form showed the intended loading configuration but neither the loading team nor the flight crew noticed that the actual configuration was different."As safety action the operator changed their strategy to load the aircraft putting the heaviest ULDs into the middle near the CG of the aircraft in order to mitigate any loading errors, a flight deck member is now required to check each ULD number as the ULD is being loaded.
A Lufthansa Airbus A340-300, registration D-AIGU performing flight LH-630 from Frankfurt/Main (Germany) to Dubai (United Arab Emirates), was accelerating for takeoff from Frankfurt's runway 18 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed due to a #4 engine (CFM56, outboard right hand) fire indication.

The aircraft slowed safely and stopped on the runway.The FAA reported the occurrence was rated an accident, the engine and aircraft received substantial damage. The aircraft was able to taxi to the apron. The engine had suffered fan blade damage.
An Ural Airlines Airbus A320-200, registration VP-BKB performing flight U6-2904 from Osh (Kyrgyzstan) to Ekaterinburg (Russia) with 128 passengers and 9 crew, struck its tail onto the runway during takeoff from Osh. The crew continued the takeoff, the aircraft got airborne and climbed out to safe altitude, the crew subsequently returned to Osh for a safe landing.The airport said, the aircraft was overloaded and therefore could not rotate normally, the tail contacted the runway surface prompting the crew to return to the airport. A replacement aircraft was dispatched to resume the flight.The airline declined to comment.The occurrence aircraft is still on the ground in Osh more than 36 hours later.
A CSA Czech Airlines Avions de Transport Regional ATR-42-500, registration OK-KFO performing flight OK-542 from Prague (Czech Republic) to Hamburg (Germany), was accelerating for takeoff when at about 70 to 80 knots the crew received a "DATA INVALID" indication at the digital air data computer. The takeoff was continued, during climb out the crew performed the relevant checklists and identified the air data reference unit #1 as defective, the relevant checklist items were carried out and the crew continued the flight. However, when the aircraft climbed through FL240 the crew observed the standby airspeed and altimeter disagreed with the values the left and right hand main indicators were showing. The crew consulted with maintenance and decided to return to Prague, where the aircraft landed safely about 25 minutes later.Czech UZPL reported in their quarterly bulletin that a static port at the right hand side of the aircraft was found blocked due to human ground operations error. The incident is under investigation.
A CAA Compagnie Africaine Aviation Fokker 50, registration 9Q-CCI performing flight BU-921 from Lodja to Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of Congo), was accelerating for takeoff from Lodja's runway 09 when the crew lost control of the aircraft, the aircraft went off the unpaved runway (length 1600 meters/5250 feet). The aircraft came to a stop about 50 meters ahead of the runway end however off the edge of the runway. No injuries are being reported, the aircraft sustained damage.The aircraft was repaired in Lodja and resumed service on Nov 17th 2013.Netherland's DSB reported the occurrence in their quarterly bulletin stating, DR Congo's accident investigation board is investigating the serious incident with the DSB having offered assistance to the investigation. No further details are known to the DSB however.
A Condor Boeing 767-300, registration D-ABUB performing flight DE-7264 from Mombasa (Kenya) to Zanzibar (Tanzania), rejected takeoff from Mombasa at high speed (approx 90 knots) after a heron was ingested into the left hand engine (PW4060). The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.A subsequent engine inspection determined that the engine was not damaged and the heron had not entered the engine core. Following engine run ups the aircraft was released to continue the flight about 2.5 hours after rejecting takeoff.The aircraft completed the leg to Tanzania, an occupant commented "inclusive smell of a chicken coop", and returned to Frankfurt as flight DE-7265 arriving in Frankfurt with a delay of 2 hours.
A Tarom Avions de Transport Regional ATR-72-500, registration YR-ATI performing flight RO-648 from Cluj to Bucharest Otopeni (Romania), rejected takeoff from Cluj due to engine problems. The aircraft safely returned to the gate.The flight was cancelled.The airline confirmed technical problems.
A Germanwings Airbus A319-100, registration D-AKNN performing flight 4U-8045 from Zweibruecken to Berlin Schoenefeld (Germany) with 132 passengers and 5 crew, had been cleared to enter runway 03, backtrack the runway, and subsequently was cleared for takeoff from runway 03 (length 2950 meters, 9680 feet, takeoff distance available in both directions: 2,675 meters/8,770 feet). While the aircraft accelerated for takeoff the controller realised that a Transall C-160 had lined up runway 21. The controller, in an attempt to stop both aircraft, radioed "Germanwings 8045, break up!" (the German word to reject takeoff is "abbrechen", which in turn as the word by word translation delivers break up) and instructed the Transall to hold position. The Germanwings crew did not understand the instruction and requested "say again", but at the same time spotted the Transall. Being above V1 the crew decided to continue takeoff and climbed out overflying the Transall at 400 feet AGL. Both aircraft continued their flights for safe landings.The German BFU released their final report concluding the probable causes of the occurrence, that involved a high risk of collision, were:The runway incursion occurred because a C-160 Transall did not stop at the holding point 21 but lined up on runway 21 due to misinterpreting the taxi clearance.Contributing factors were the deviations from standard operating procedures. These were:- The take-off direction intended for and used by the C-160 Transall was opposite to the operating direction of the runway for all other take-offs and landings that day.- The standardised phraseology for radio communications was not consequently adhered to.- The read-back-hear-back procedure was not consequently adhered to. The wrong line-up could not be detected by the crews of the airplanes involved. Due to the elevation profile of the runway, the opposite airplane could not be seen or only to a limited extent.The controller, too, could not see every airplane on the ground at all times due to the elevation profile of the runway.The BFU reported that the Airbus had been cleared to "line up 03, backtrack approved". While the aircraft taxied to runway 03 the Transall, scheduled a fly a number of parachute deliveries that day, requested clearance for a sky diving operation according to VFR. Tower indicated runway 03 to the Transall, the crew however, due to the very tight schedule that day, requested runway 21 which involved substantially shorter taxi. Tower replied "21 approved". A few minutes later the Transall requested taxi, tower cleared the flight to "taxi holding point runway, correction, taxi holding point Alpha, runway 21" and the crew read back: "Taxi runway holding point runway 21 via Alpha".One minute after the Transall reading back their taxi clearance the A319 received takeoff clearance.When the A319 began their takeoff roll the controller realized the Transall had already lined up on runway 21. He instructed the Transall to "hold position" and the Germanwings to "break up". The A319 had already reached/exceeded V1 at the time of that instruction, the crew did not understand the "break up", the recorded ATC transmissions contain a "say again" (source unidentified). The A319 crew recognized the vertical tail of an aircraft in opposite direction on the runway almost at the same time of the "break up" instruction, being above V1 they determined a reject was no longer possible, and continued the takeoff, rotated the aircraft and climbed out overflying the Transall at 400 feet AGL according to testimony by both crews.In the subsequent exchange between Transall and tower the Transall crew claimed to have received a line up clearance while the tower repeated they had been cleared to holding point Alpha only. The Transall acknowledged "O.K., sorry about that". The BFU reported that in post flight interviews all crew members confirmed they had received line up clearance.The captain of the A319 (30, ATPL) had accumulated about 4,600 hours of total flying experience, the first officer of the A319 (41, CPL) had accumulated about 492 hours of total flying experience. The commander of the Transall (59, Military License) had about 8,638 hours of flying experience, the first officer (31, Military License) 512 hours, the flight engineer (38) 2,661 hours and the loadmaster (32) 573 hours.The BFU stated that they were notified by the German Bundeswehr (operator of the Transall) with delay of 24 hours not recognizing the severity of the occurrence until a few phone conversations over the next couple of days later, the cockpit voice recordings were thus no longer available to the investigation. In addition, the recordings of Zweibruecken Tower were not continuous, the recording would only commence upon sound and stop after some time of silence. Due to a rise of about 10 feet in about the middle of the runway the controller as well as the A319 crew were not able to see the Transall as it was taxiing along the taxiway onto the runway. The BFU opened the analysis stating: "The Serious Incident involving the Airbus A319 and the C-160 Transall on 14 May 2008 at Zweibrücken Airfield meets the ICAO definitions for runway incursions3. One airplane was on runway 21 for take-off even though another airplane was on take-off run on runway 03. A high collision risk existed. A collision was prevented by a close call."The BFU analysed that there was no evidence of any technical malfunction.The BFU analysed that the communication between tower and the A319 was according to the books involving standard phraseology. The Airbus crew did not make any mistake.The BFU analysed that runway 03 was active at the time of the occurrence, the Transall however requested runway 21 due to their tight schedule requiring to minimize taxi times, wind conditions and performance of the aircraft permitted the use of runway 21. There had also been a phone agreement between Bundeswehr and Tower to use runway 21. The BFU analysed: "About two minutes later, taxi clearance was given with the words "... 173, taxi holding point runway, correction, taxi holding point Alpha, runway 21" and therefore a clearance to taxi to the holding point runway 21. From the controller's point of view the mistake "taxi holding position runway" was thus corrected. In accordance with the standardised phraseology the correct wording should have been "Taxi holding point runway 21 via Alpha". The correct line-up clearance should have been "Line up runway 21". It cannot be ruled out that the corrected take-off direction in combination with the corrected taxi clearance was the beginning of confusion. The C-160 Transall crew carried out the clearance as line-up clearance. The instruction and the acknowledgement were not in complete agreement with the stipulated phraseology."The BFU analysed: "With the instruction "172 hold position" and "8045, break up" the controller intended to stop both airplanes 44 seconds after the take-off clearance to the Airbus A319. Both instructions immediately followed one another because he had realised that the C-160 Transall had lined up on runway 21 and the Airbus A319 had already begun its take-off run from the opposite direction. The Airbus A319 pilot asked again because he had not understood the instruction "8045, break up". The wording "break up" is insofar unclear because one cannot necessarily deduce to reject take-off. The correct phraseology would have been "stop immediately". The Airbus A319 continued the take-off run also due to the speed reached."The BFU stated: "A rejected take-off could have resulted in a collision or a runway excursion because the speed of the Airbus A319 had already been above V1 as the PIC stated."The BFU analysed: "The elevation profile of the runway was of importance. Because the middle runway section was about 10 ft higher than threshold 03 and about 20 ft higher than threshold 21 the crews of the airplanes could only see each other to a limited extent. Neither crew had an unobstructed view to check whether the runway was free. Such an elevation difference between the middle runway section and the two thresholds is rather rare but the crews involved and the tower controller knew about it. There were no stopbars or runway guard lights. No weather-related visibility limitation, which could have contributed to the occurrence, existed. The camouflage painting of the C-160 Transall may have influenced the visual recognition of it."The BFU analysed: "The BFU is of the opinion that vagueness in the communication prompted the C-160 Transall crew to line up. It was not a single error but small inadequacies which added up. The BFU is of the opinion that loss of orientation, e.g. holding point Alpha was not found, is rather improbable. Considering all facts determined during the investigation the BFU does not assume that the line-up clearance for the C-160 Transall was really issued. The experiences made during the analysis of CVR and radio communication recordings in the scope of accident investigation in the past show that a few days after the occurrence persons involved in the occurrence create a mental scenario which can deviate from the actual situation. This does not mean it is a conscious or deliberate false testimony."The BFU stated: "However, indefeasible proof was not given due to the recording procedure of the radio communications. The digital recording procedure with so-called .wav files was not consecutive but was stopped when no-one was speaking. During read-out and copying of the .wav files individual files were generated depending on the length of the communication. The individual files carried a time stamp but proof of the integrity was not given. Therefore, the BFU could not prove beyond doubt the integrity of the recordings."The BFU analysed that given the elevation profile of the runway the simultaneous use of both directions should be avoided given "that airplanes standing at opposing runway ends cannot see each other or only to a limited extent depending on their size."
A Sunwing Airlines Boeing 737-800, registration C-FYLC performing flight WG-434 from Montreal,QC (Canada) to Punta Cana (Dominican Republic) with 160 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Montreal's runway 06R when at about 90 knots a bang occurred associated with a slight left yaw. The crew continued takeoff but at 130 knots another bang was heard with a pronounced left yaw. The crew rejected takeoff and slowed safely reporting to ATC that they suspected a tyre problem and advised a runway inspection would be good.A runway inspection did not find any debris.The Canadian TSB reported that the left hand engine (CFM56) was removed from the aircraft for repairs.A replacement Travel Service Boeing 737-800 registration OK-TVS, leased out to Sunwing, reached Punta Cana with a delay of 6:45 hours.
A SAS Scandinavian Airlines Canadair CRJ-900, registration LN-RNL performing flight SK-436 from Copenhagen (Denmark) to Gothenburg (Sweden) with 24 passengers and 4 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Copenhagen's Kastrup Airport when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed, about 10 seconds after applying takeoff thrust, after the captain smelled smoke in the cockpit. The aircraft stopped on the runway, flight and cabin crew established there was smoke in cockpit and cabin, the occupants rapidly deplaned onto the runway while emergency services responded. Passengers reported that the engines had spooled up and the aircraft was accelerating on the runway for about 10 seconds when the brakes came on and the aircraft stopped, the flight crew had donned their oxygen masks. About a minute after coming to a stop cabion crew initiated the evacuation of the aircraft.The cause of the smoke is being investigated.
An Airbus Industries Airbus A300-600 Beluga, registration F-GSTA performing freight flight BGA-1TA from Toulouse (France) to Chester,EN (UK) with 3 crew, was preparing for departure from Toulouse at 114.4 tons of takeoff weight, slats were set to 15 degrees, flaps to 20 degrees and V2 was computed and set at 141 KIAS. The first officer, pilot flying, lined the aircraft up on runway 14R then gradually increased thrust levers and trigged the Go-Levers (TOGA). He then checked the Flight Mode Announciators in agreement with his command, the captain called "FMA indications checked", the flight engineer observed the thrust levers moving into the commanded takeoff position specifically stating that he didn't override them. The aircraft became airborne and the captain selected the gear up, at that occasion he noticed that his flight mode announciator (FMA) no longer showed the expected SRS indication for takeoff, but a THR L (thrust latch) indication in continuous green. His flight director instructed a nose down input. The first officer found his flight mode announciations in agreement with the his commands (showing SRS, flight director commanding climb out pitch). Because of the ínconsistencies between the captain's and first officer's indications the first officer disengaged THR L, which was acknowledged by the FMA now showing MAN THR. The first officer asked the captain to engage autothrust on the flight control unit, the FMAs now showed SPD for the thrust channel and the thrust levers began to retard, the first officer immediately prevented the thrust levers from retarding by pushing them forward and disengaging autothrust. The climb out was continued manually, climbing through 3500 feet autothrust was re-engaged and the flight continued without any further anomalies for a safe landing in Chester.The French BEA released their final report into the occurrence rated an incident and concluded:The incident was due to the crews failure to detect the non-engagement of the TAKE OFF mode during the FMA check during the take-off run phase. This malfunction probably originated in an erratic failure of the wiring between the Go levers and the FCC1.The BEA reported that only the quick access recorder (QAR) data were available to the investigation. The QAR recorded the announciations of the left hand system (FCC1) and throttle lever positions, it was not possible to determine the announciations on the right hand side (first officer).According to the QAR the FMA showed THR L V/S HDG on the incident flight, the thrust levers moved at a rate of 8 degrees/second, while on subsequent flights the FMA showed THR SRS HDGSEL respective THR SRS RWY and the thrust levers moved at 3 degrees/second. The FMA during the incident flight "corresponded to an inactive TAKE OFF mode".The BEA analyzed that the GO-Lever signal was received by the Thrust Control Computer #1 (TCC1) evident by its engagement in THR L mode. However, the Flight Control Computer #1 (FCC1) did not receive that signal evident by the failure to engage in TAKE OFF mode. The BEA stated: "This anomaly probably came from an erratic failure of the wiring between the Go levers and the FCC1." However, tests were unable to reproduce the anomaly and there was no defect found at the Go-Levers and associated wiring.The BEA reported in the analysis that another crew, flying the very same aircraft, had observed the same anomaly on May 11th 2011, too, reporting that the FMAs were as expected until after the landing gear was retracted at which point THR L was indicated on both FMAs and the thrust reduced without crew command. A technical analysis following that event was unable to highlight a failure.The BEA highlighted lessons learned from the event:"The Captains verbal check call out did not include calling out the displayed modes but consisted of calling out CHECKED. This check may have been carried out in a routine manner. It proved to be ineffective. "and"The speed of movement of the levers, twice as high as that encountered during a normal takeoff, may have drawn the crews attention to the ATHR not being engaged in THR mode."As result of the investigation Airbus decided to modify the flight crew operations manual to include "an operational instruction that will deal with the TAKE OFF mode not being engaged."The BEA stated: "The QAR data made it possible to reconstruct the modes that were displayed on the left FMA. Their development showed a divergence between the situation described by the crew and that recorded by the QAR. This divergence has not been explained."The Aviation Herald had summarized the original French version of the report in July 2013 at Report: Airbus A306 at Toulouse on Sep 13th 2011, uncommanded fall back of autothrust on takeoff.
A Veteran Avia Boeing 747-200 freighter on behalf of Saudi Arabian Airlines, registration EK74799 performing flight SV-934 from Amsterdam (Netherlands) to Jeddah (Saudi Arabia), was accelerating for takeoff from Amsterdam's runway 24 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (92 knots over ground) reporting a problem with the nose gear, declined assistance and vacated the runway. Emergency services responded, inspected the aircraft and followed the aircraft to the apron.The incident aircraft is still on the ground in Amsterdam 7 hours later.
A Severstal Canadair CRJ-200, registration RA-67230 performing flight D2-23 from Cherepovets to St. Petersburg (Russia) with 11 passengers and 3 crew, rejected takeoff from Cherepovets' runway at about 08:30L (04:30Z) but could not stop before the end of the icy runway and overran the end of the runway before coming to stop. There were no injuries, the aircraft sustained no damage.Emergency services reported that the runway was iced up and slippery.The airport was closed for about 4 hours as result and resumed operations just after noon.The incident aircraft was able to resume service later the day.Metars:ULWC 080600Z 26005G08MPS 9999 -SHRA BKN008 OVC016CB 03/02 Q0999 TEMPO 1000 SHRA BKN003 RMK QBB260 QFE740/0986 SC039=ULWC 080530Z 25007G10MPS 9000 -RA BKN006 OVC/// 03/02 Q1000 TEMPO 1000 SNRA BKN003 RMK QBB180 QFE740/0986 SC039=ULWC 080500Z 25005G08MPS 3600 -RA BKN006 OVC/// 03/02 Q1000 TEMPO 1000 SNRA BKN003 RMK QBB190 QFE740/0987 SC039=ULWC 080430Z 25006G09MPS 4000 -RA BKN006 OVC/// 02/01 Q1001 TEMPO 1000 SNRA BKN003 RMK QBB190 QFE740/0987 SC039=ULWC 080400Z 23004G07MPS 7000 -RA OVC004 02/01 Q1001 TEMPO 1000=ULWC 080330Z 22003G06MPS 8000 -RA OVC004 01/01 Q1001 TEMPO 1000=ULWC 080300Z 21003G06MPS 3300 -RA OVC003 01/01 Q1002 TEMPO 1000 SNRA BKN003 RMK QBB110 QFE742/0989 SC030=ULWC 080230Z 21003G06MPS 9999 -SN OVC003 01/00 Q1003 TEMPO 1000=ULWC 080200Z 21004G07MPS 3900 -SN OVC003 01/00 Q1003 TEMPO 1000=ULWC 080130Z 23004G07MPS 3200 -SN OVC003 01/00 Q1004 TEMPO 1000=ULWC 080100Z 22005G08MPS 7000 -SN OVC004 01/00 Q1004 TEMPO 1000=
A Ryanair Boeing 737-800, registration EI-EPH performing flight FR-9052 from Alicante,SP (Spain) to Brussels Charleroi (Belgium) with 174 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff when the crew received a door indication for one of the overwing exits and rejected takeoff at low speed. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.Maintenance determined a fault in the Proximity Swith Electronic Unit (PSEU) which caused the door indication.A passenger reported there was a sudden "funny noise" almost immediately followed by the brakes coming on very hard. The aircraft returned to a parking stand, the captain announced that due a technical problem the takeoff was aborted. The crew was communicating with the headquarters to see whether the aircraft could depart with updates about every 15 minutes at first indicating that the aircraft would be able to depart. In the end an announcement was made that a replacement aircraft would fly to Brussels. The passenger reported that shortly after arriving in Brussels an e-mail arrived from Ryanair indicating that extraordinary circumstances outside the responsibility of Ryanair had led to the aborted takeoff and delay.A replacement Boeing 737-800 registration EI-DPH reached Brussels with a delay of 6:45 hours.Ryanair told The Aviation Herald: "The Captain of this flight cancelled his take-off after a cockpit warning light indicated a possible issue with an overwing exit. The aircraft returned to stand where passengers were disembarked and provided with refreshment vouchers. As Ryanair didn't have the required spare parts in Alicante, a replacement aircraft together with engineers and parts were dispatched from Brussels Charleroi. A Ryanair engineer cleared the fault on arrival and the aircraft returned to service."
An Air Berlin Airbus A330-200, registration D-ALPB performing flight AB-7444 from Munich (Germany) to La Romana (Dominican Republic), rejected takeoff from Munich's runway 08L at low speed (speed over ground at about 60 knots) due to engine problems. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The incident aircraft was able to depart about 8 hours later and reached La Romana with a delay of 8 hours.A passenger reported that after the aircraft had returned to the gate technicians checked the aircraft, the first officer made an announcement indicating an engine problem and a spare part needed to be flown in from Dusseldorf. The aircraft departed about 8 hours later.
A THY Turkish Airlines Airbus A330-200, registration TC-JND performing flight TK-5 from Istanbul (Turkey) to Chicago O'Hare,IL (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Ataturk Airport's runway 35R when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed. The aircraft vacated the runway, stopped to have the brakes cool down and departed again reaching Chicago with a delay of 40 minutes.A passenger reported the crew announced there had been a runway incursion and ATC cancelled the takeoff clearance as result.According to (incomplete) ATC recordings an Atlasjet aircraft had landed on runway 35L and had been instructed to hold short of runway 35R due to departing traffic. Subsequently illegible Turkish can be heard on the recording.
A Jazz de Havilland Dash 8-100, registration C-GTAI performing flight QK-8792 from Montreal,QC to Saint John,NB (Canada) with 40 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Montreal's runway 24L when an airport operations vehicles observed sparks and flames from the right hand main gear. The crew rejected takeoff at low speed and stopped on the runway, the engines were shut down and passengers prepared for evacuation while emergency services responded. Emergency services indicated no evacuation was necessary, the passengers disembarked onto the runway after a bus had arrived and were bussed to the terminal.The runway was closed for 65 minutes until the aircraft was towed off the runway.The Canadian TSB reported that a malfunction was detected on the brakes assembly #4, the brakes assembly was replaced.A replacement Dash 8-100 reached Saint John with a delay of 3 hours.
A Transaero Boeing 737-700, registration EI-RUM performing flight UN-2154 from Tomsk to Moscow Vnukovo (Russia) with 68 passengers and 8 crew, rejected takeoff from Tomsk's runway 21 at low speed (about 20 knots) due to a door open indication. The aircraft returned to the apron for repairs.A replacement Boeing 737-700 registration EI-EUZ was dispatched from Moscow Vnukovo to Tomsk as flight UN-8731 and reached Moscow with a delay of 12 hours.
A Field Aviation de Havilland Dash 8-300, registration C-GNUD performing a flight from Muskoka,ON to Toronto,ON (Canada) with 5 people on board, was rotating for takeoff from Muskoka when the pilot flying noticed excessive control forces were needed on the elevator. The aircraft became briefly airborne while the pilot flying rejected takeoff, retarded throttles to idle and returned the aircraft onto the runway for a safe rollout.The Canadian TSB confirmed the aircraft was briefly airborne while the takeoff was rejected due to excessive pitch control forces. While taxiing back the crew noticed the controls could not reach the full travel limits. Two subsequent high speed runs confirmed excessive control forces, then the aircraft was returned to a maintenance hangar. The aircraft was about to perform the first flight since being repainted, the flight controls had been removed by another contractor for the paint job. The controls had been reinstalled and balanced by the other contractor after the paint job, two independent signatures confirmed the works were done correctly and the aircraft was airworthy. Inspection revealed however that the counterweights on the elevator trim tab had been installed in reverse which prevented elevator spring tab full travel and increased aerodynamic load on the elevator controls at high speed. The counterweights were reinstalled correctly, the aircraft tested with no further faults and returned to service.Muskoka features a runway 18/36 with 6000 feet/1830 meters length and a runway 09/27 of 2200 feet/670 meters.
A Fedex Federal Express McDonnell Douglas MD-11 freighter, registration N599FE performing freight flight FX-4 from Osaka Kansai to Tokyo Narita (Japan) with 2 crew, rejected takeoff from Kansai Airport's runway 06R at low speed when the crew believed they had blown a tyre. The aircraft vacated the runway. A runway inspection found debris on the runway which was identified to belong to the aircraft's left hand engine's inlet.The aircraft returned to the apron, the flight was cancelled.The runway was closed for about 80 minutes until all debris had been cleared.Japan's Ministry of Transport reported an investigation has been opened into the occurrence.
A Westjet Boeing 737-700, registration C-FWSY performing flight WS-4143 from Calgary,AB to Edmonton,AB (Canada) with 55 people on board, encountered heavy vibrations at about 80 knots during the takeoff roll. The takeoff was continued, the crew decided to continue the flight to Edmonton but requested emergency services on stand by. The aircraft landed safely on Edmonton's runway 02 about 30 minutes later with emergency services on stand by.The Canadian TSB reported that the aircraft experienced "heavy nose wheel shimmy" through about 80 knots. The crew requested emergency services on stand by for arrival in Edmonton. Maintenance found a large amount of ice buildup on the nose gear wheel well. The TSB stated: "The ice was removed and along with it, the shimmy."http://flightaware.com/live/flight/WJA4143/history/20131204/2205Z/CYYC/CYEG
A Jazz de Havilland Dash 8-300, registration C-GEWQ performing flight QK-8988 from Ottawa,ON to Montreal,QC (Canada), had been cleared for takeoff from Ottawa's runway 14 and was accelerating for takeoff when a government aircraft (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), cleared to cross runway 14, entered the runway. The Dash continued takeoff, became airborne and continued to Montreal for a safe landing.Nav Canada reported the Jazz crew never saw the other traffic conflicting in front and stated "Separation was not assured".The Canadian TSB opened an investigation into the occurrence.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/JZA8988/history/20131201/2340Z/CYOW/CYUL
A Jazz de Havilland Dash 8-100, registration C-FGRY performing flight QK-8752 from Val d'Or,QC to Montreal,QC (Canada) with 26 people on board, was cleared for takeoff, the crew applied take off power, while the engines accelerated the torque indication for the right hand engine (PW120A) dropped to zero for about 5 seconds. The crew rejected takeoff at about 20-30 knots. The crew subsequently performed three engine run ups, the fault did not re-occur. The crew therefore decided to depart. Following an uneventful takeoff run the aircraft climbed through 700 feet AGL when the right hand propeller auto-feathered. The crew declared emergency, shut the engine down and returned to Val d'Or for a safe landing.The Canadian TSB reported that maintenance replaced the right hand engine, the right hand propeller assembly and the #1 torque signal control unit. A wiring check was performed without any anomalies found. Engine runs revealed no faults and the aircraft was returned to service. Tests on the replaced engine and propeller assembly showed no faults.
A TAP Air Portugal Airbus A330-200, registration CS-TOP performing flight TP-48 from Porto Alegre,RS (Brazil) to Lisbon (Portugal), rejected takeoff from Porto Alegre's runway 11 at high speed (100+ knots over ground) due to the loss of power on one engine (CF6).

A SAS Scandinavian Airlines Airbus A320-200, registration OY-KAN performing flight SK-1210 from Aalborg to Copenhagen (Denmark), was accelerating for takeoff from Aalborg's runway 26R when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed after an engine (V2527) ingested a bird. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The flight was cancelled.The airport reported the engine received substantial damage. The about 100 passengers were rebooked onto other flights.
An Air Canada Boeing 767-300, registration C-GDUZ performing flight AC-63 from Vancouver,BC (Canada) to Seoul (South Korea) with 217 people on board, was rotating for takeoff from Vancouver's 26L when the aircraft accelerated through a small flock of birds, a number of birds were ingested into the right hand engine (CF6). Although the engine continued to function properly the crew noticed an increased indication of vibrations, stopped the climb at 9000 feet, dumped fuel and returned to Vancouver for a safe landing on runway 26L about 80 minutes after departure.The Canadian TSB reported that the right hand engine and nose cowl were replaced.A replacement Boeing 767-300 registration C-GEOQ reached Seoul with a delay of 8 hours.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/ACA63/history/20131102/1940Z/CYVR/CYVR
An American Airlines Boeing 737-800, registration N894NN performing flight AA-1224 from San Jose,CA to Dallas Ft. Worth,TX (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from San Jose's runway 30R when the aircraft sustained a bird strike prompting the crew to reject takeoff at high speed just after passing the displaced threshold. The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway, the crew declined assistance but requested the runway to be inspected for bird debris. The FAA reported the aircraft sustained substantial damage as result of the bird strike during takeoff roll, the occurrence was rated an accident.
A Transporte Aereo Militar (TAM Bolivia) Boeing 737-200, flight 710 from Cochabamba to La Paz (Bolivia), rejected takeoff from Cochabamba at low speed, returned to the holding point and attempted a second takeoff, however, needed to reject the takeoff at low speed again. The aircraft returned to the apron.Passengers reported that the crew indicated problems with the tyres as cause for the rejected takeoffs.The airline said the flight was suspended for technical reasons.A replacement aircraft reached La Paz with a delay of approximately 10 hours.
A United Boeing 747-400, registration N182UA performing flight UA-840 from Sydney,NS (Australia) to Los Angeles,CA (USA), was in the initial climb out of runway 34L when the crew reported it appeared they blew a tyre on takeoff, tower might want to double check the runway and they were returning to Sydney. Runway 34L was closed, a runway inspection discovered "lots of rubber" on the runway. The aircraft entered a hold at 10,000 feet to dump fuel and returned to Sydney for a safe landing on runway 34L about 90 minutes after departure. During roll out tower reported some smoke from the left main gear, it appeared there was some rubber missing from those wheels. The aircraft vacated the runway via taxiway G and stopped clear of the runway. Both left aft body gear tyres had separated with the wheels running on their rims, tyre debris impact marks around the wing root fairings.Runway 34L was closed for about 20 minutes until the debris had been removed, but needed to be closed again due to damage on the runway caused by the wheels. The runway was opened and closed a number of times over the next 5 hours as result of the occurrence.The flight was cancelled.N182UA seen at the gate (Photo: Airline Hub Buzz):
An Avianca Fokker 50, registration HK-4497 performing flight AV-9279 from Bogota to Ibague (Colombia) with 34 passengers and 4 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Bogota's runway 13R when the crew received indication of a low oil pressure for the right hand engine. The crew rejected takeoff at high speed and safely slowed the aircraft. When about to turn off the runway the crew was radioed by tower indicating smoke from the engine, the engine indicated overtemperature and increasing vibrations. The crew shut the engine down and activated the fire suppression system, the passengers rapidly disembarked the aircraft. There were no injuries.The Dutch Onderzoeksraad reported in their quarterly bulletin that Colombia's authorities found several turbine blades of the right hand engine were damaged and rated the occurrence a serious incident, an investigation was opened, the Onderzoeksraad (representing the country of manufacture) offered assistance to the investigation.
The AAIB released their bulletin stating that one passenger received a serious and 15 passengers minor injuries during the evacuation.The aircraft was accelerating for takeoff when the flight crew became of a strange smell in the cockpit, passengers and cabin crew noticed strange smell followed by what appeared to be smoke from the overhead bins. The chief flight attendant repeatedly pressed the flight deck call button to alert the flight crew of a developing emergency situation in the cabin. When the aircraft accelerated through 80 knots both pilots noticed "misting" in the cockpit and the smell intensified. The captain called to reject takeoff, closed the thrust levers, disconnected autothrottles, applied maximum braking, selected the spoilers fully up and opened the thrust reversers. The first officer confirmed the rejected takeoff and spoilers were fully open and thrust reversers had opened. When the aircraft declerated through 60 knots the first officer selected the flaps to 40 degrees to facilitate a possible evacuation and radioed ATC they were stopping. The chief flight attendant was called to the flight deck to brief on the status in the cabin, smoke in the cabin was clearly visible through the flight deck door, the captain therefore ordered the evacuation of the aircraft.A number of passengers exited through the overwing exits, and given the darkness did not recognize they could slide down the flaps and instead jumped down. A number returned into the cabin and exited through the main doors.Passengers evacuating through the doors slid down rapidly due to the wet surface and had difficulty to clear the slide before the next passenger arrived down. This caused collisions and injuries. The serious injury occurred to female passenger (77) after sliding down the door slide, when she badly landed on the runway and fractured bones in her neck. The 15 other minor injuries occurred on the door slides as well as result of collisions or being knocked over on slide off the end of the slide.An initial examination of the aircraft's engines did not reveal any anomaly. The packs were examined and the right hand air recycle machine replaced when it hesitated to operate during the examination. Laboratory analysis revealed no anomaly however, analysis of the filters did not find any contamination. The aircraft was testflown without recurrence before being returned to service.The AAIB analysed: "No defects were identified on the aircraft that could have led to the smoke or fumes that were seen and smelt.Laboratory analysis of the cabin temperature sensor air filters, exposed to cabin air, showed that there were no unusual substances or residues of oil or hydraulic fluid present.At the beginning of the flight, the air conditioning packs were selected ON after engine start, in accordance with the standard operating procedures, but later than on the other flights sampled. This, combined with the short taxi time, may have meant that the cabin was slightly warmer than usual by the time the takeoff commenced.The ambient conditions on the day meant the air was humid, with the temperature and dew point only one degree apart. As engine power was increased for takeoff, more air was available for air conditioning and the air conditioning system was able to supply colder air to the cabin to achieve the selected temperature. As the cabin was warm and humid, this sudden influx of cold air, potentially down to 1.7°C, could have caused the formation of mist or fog in the cabin which, in the low lighting conditions, could have given the appearance of smoke or fumes."
An Iberia Airbus A319-100, registration EC-KHM performing flight IB-3489 from Geneva (Switzerland) to Madrid,SP (Spain), rejected takeoff from runway 23 at high speed (more than 88 knots over ground), slowed safely and vacated the runway. The crew stopped the aircraft, emergency services checked the brakes, the crew indicated they were ready for another takeoff and taxied to the holding point of runway 05. Upon query by the tower the crew reported they rejected takeoff because of a spurios warning adding "we find a lot of electronic devices turned on on board".A passenger reported the crew announced mobile phones on board, still turned on, had caused interference with the aircraft systems.The aircraft departed about 25 minutes after rejecting the first takeoff and reached Madrid on time.
The Interstate Aviation Committee (MAK) have released their final report in Russian concluding the probable cause of the crash was:In violation of procedures set forth in the flight manuals the crew performed the takeoff without having the surfaces of the aircraft deiced, although the crew detected snow and ice deposits during taxi. Consequently the aerodynamic properties of the aircraft deteriorated so that it stalled during initial climb, the crew did not recognize the stall and thus was not able to return the aircraft to within flight envelope.Contributing factors- Deficiencies in UTAir Safety Management, that exists only on general terms and is not adopted to address specific activites in all areas of the company, which prevents timely detection and addressing risks affecting safety of flights- Deficiencies in UTAir Technik in terms of staff training and work supervision in relation to deicing processes, manifested in a number of non-compliances with requirements of manuals, leading to admission of non-trained staff for assessment of necessity of de-icing and application of de-icing procedures- Deficiencies in the initial and recurrent training of flight crew to understand the severity of takeoff without de-icing applied and the consequences for aerodynamic properties as well as the purpose and use of aircraft anti-ice systems, which prevented the crew to abort taxi for departure and apply de-icing procedures after detecting snow and ice deposits.- Methodical shortcomings of programmes for simulator training for flight crew detect onset of stall, recognize stall patterns and avoid entering stall.- Increasing demand of training facilities due to increasing number of flight crew to satisfy growth of traffic together with the absence of a safety management system leading to formalism and methodical omissions in the work of instructors preparing flight crew to develop skills in making informed decisions and strict observance of rules and procedures.- Possible crew fatigue to violations of work and rest timesOn Oct 9th 2013 the French BEA released the English version of the draft final report (not the actual final report).The crew had flown the aircraft into Tyumen the previous afternoon and had parked the aircraft over night in temperatures around 0 degrees C, humidity of 100% and weak snow and rain fall. Following a night rest at the airport hotel the crew began preflight preparations including consulting weather offices. The commander subsequently decided to depart.The commander (28, ATPL, 2,602 hours total, 2,522 hours on type) performed a rapid walk around, according to airport surveillance videos he needed a few seconds to get to the right hand engine, proceeded along the side of the fuselage, stopped the left main landing gear, then entered the cabin. The commander, pilot flying, was assisted by a first officer (24, CPL, 1,825 hours total, 1,765 hours on type) as pilot monitoring. Both their command of English did not allow them to understand the contents of training materials provided in English.During taxi out the commander instructed to activate the aircraft's anti ice systems, including the de-icing boots, during a delay in taxiing due to another aircraft in the way. A subsequent communication between the pilots suggested that the de-icing boots had been activated due to the commander spotting snow and ice on the wings.The crew set the flaps at 15 degrees and commenced the takeoff run, the aircraft became airborne at 127 knots. When the aircraft climbed through 640 feet AGL at 139 knots, the crew began to retract the flaps, at 690 feet AGL and 150 knots the aircraft developed a spontaneous right roll, the autopilot was disengaged, stall warnings activated and continued to impact, the bank angle reached 40 degrees to the right, then aileron and rudder were applied. The aircraft now rolled left, the crew applied full aileron to the right but could not stop the roll. The aircraft impacted ground with a pitch of 11 degrees nose down and 55 degrees of left bank at a vertical speed of 3900 fpm. Of the 43 people on board all 4 crew and 29 passengers died, 10 passengers survived with serious injuries. The aircraft was destroyed.Post impact and post fire photos still showed snow and ice deposits on the horizontal stabilizer.Examination of the wreckage revealed no malfunction prior to impact.The MAK analysed that ICAO level 4 language skill does not warrant training materials in English could be understood. The ICAO language proficiency does require speech activity to comprehend instructions by ATC and speak to ATC only. The ability to read or write is not required.The MAK analyed that during preflight preparation of the accident aircraft three Boeing 737s departed, all had been de-iced. In the 90 minutes prior to the accident a total of 9 aircraft, including 4 UTAir aircraft, had departed, all had been de-iced. Another ATR-72 parked at Tyumen over night showed a snow and ice accumulation of 3cm on the top of the wings and stabilizers, partly supercooled as result of a supercooled rain that occured throughout the evening and night. This ATR-72 had been deiced and departed without incident just prior to the accident aircraft.The MAK analysed that neither ground staff handling UTAir Aircraft at Tyumen had been licensed or held certificates of training. Ground staff had received instruction on de-icing for about 30 minutes.After the other ATR-72 had been de-iced by ground staff, the accident aircraft was being handled, ground staff inspected the aircraft but did not detect any trace of snow or ice on the surfaces and declared the aircraft clean. The MAK however analysed that without the use of ladders, just by visual inspection from the ground, snow and ice accretion can not be detected.The final defense was breached when the commander performed a quick walk around finishing the inspection within seconds. After the commander had entered the aircraft, the ground mechanics entered the aircraft, too, and informed the commander that the aircraft was clean.Following takeoff the crew engaged the autopilot and set the speed target to 170 knots, which was never achieved, the highest speed recorded was 152 knots. Immediately after the flaps were selected up at 139 knots, the aircraft entered a right roll, the autopilot disengaged and the stall cricket sounds activated. The MAK analysed that subsequent movements of the aircraft indicate that the aircraft had entered deep stall leading to impact at high vertical but little horizontal speed.Snow and ice accreation on horizontal stabilizer still visible after the accident (Photo: MAK):Flight trajectory (Graphics: MAK):
A United Boeing 757-200, registration N595UA performing flight UA-824 from San Francisco,CA to New York JFK,NY (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from runway 01R when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed reporting they had an electrical failure. The crew returned to the holding point and attempted a second takeoff about 10 minutes later but again rejected at low speed reporting the right hand generator had tripped off, they were now returning to the terminal.A replacement Boeing 757-200 registration N546UA reached New York with a delay of 3 hours.
A Monarch Airlines Airbus A320-200, registration G-OZBB performing flight ZB-239 from Lanzarote,CI (Spain) to London Gatwick,EN (UK), was accelerating for takeoff from runway 03 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed (speed over ground above 105 knots) due to an engine (CFM56) failure. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.A replacement aircraft is being dispatched to Lanzarote.
A Flydubai Boeing 737-800, registration A6-FDT performing flight FZ-340 from Multan (Pakistan) to Dubai (United Arab Emirates), was accelerating for takeoff from Multan when the right hand engine (CFM56) ingested a number of birds. The takeoff was continued, in the absence of abnormal indications the crew decided to continue the flight to Dubai. Already enroute some time later the crew received abnormal indications for the engine however and decided to divert to Karachi (Pakistan), located about 390nm southsouthwest of Multan, where the aircraft landed safely on runway 25L about 90 minutes after departure from Multan.Following repairs the aircraft was able to depart Karachi after 13:15 hours on the ground and reached Dubai with a delay of 14:45 hours.
An Endeavor Canadair CRJ-200, registration N8416B performing flight 9E-4027 from Ottawa,ON (Canada) to Detroit,MI (USA) with 32 people on board, had been cleared for takeoff from runway 25 and was accelerating for takeoff when the crew spotted the preceding arrival had not completely vacated the runway and rejected takeoff at high speed. The aircraft slowed safely, but needed to wait for the hot brakes to cool before attempting another departure.The Canadian TSB reported, that the preceding arrival, an Air Canada Airbus A320-200 registration C-FNVV performing flight AC-166 from Vancouver,BC to Ottawa,ON (Canada) with 143 people on board, had landed on runway 25 and was instructed to vacate via taxiway Echo, however needed to stop due to conflicting traffic on the apron and came to a stop before crossing the hold short line. The aircraft was instructed to move as far forward as possible however still remained within the runway protected zone. In the meantime the CRJ-200 crew noticed the A320 had not vacated the runway and rejected takeoff. The flight was delayed due to hot brakes.
A UTAir Ukraine Avions de Transport Regional ATR-42-300, registration UR-UTE performing flight QU-129 from Donetsk (Ukraine) to Moscow Vnukovo (Russia), was just rotating for takeoff from Donetsk when the crew spotted a dog on the runway. The crew decided to continue the flight to the destination, where the aircraft landed safely.Ukraine's State Aviation Service reported in their monthly bulletin that only after landing in Moscow damage was found that resulted from the right hand main gear hitting the dog. An investigation was not opened into the occurrence, however. A safety recommendation to all Ukrainian Airport Operators was re-iterated to provide proper fencing.
A Mahan Air Boeing 747-300, registration EP-MNE performing Hajj flight W5-5070 from Kerman (Iran) to Madinah (Saudi Arabia) with 419 passengers and 25 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Kerman's runway 34 when a problem with one of the engines (CF6) prompted the crew to reject takeoff at high speed just below V1. The aircraft overran the end of the runway and came to a stop about 170 meters past the end of the runway with a number of main gear tyres deflated. 10 passengers received minor injuries.Kerman's ILS system runway 34 needed to be temporarily taken out of service as result of the overrun. The runway 16/34 was initially closed and later returned to service with a displaced threshold runway 16 before the aircraft was moved back onto paved surface and onto runway 05/23, where it is currently parked. Runway and ILS were returned to full service at that point.EP-MNE on soft ground:Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):
A Virgin Australia Regional Avion de Transport Regional ATR-72-600, registration VH-FVN performing flight XR-631 from Canberra,AC to Sydney,NS (Australia) with 43 passengers, had been cleared for takeoff from Canberra's runway 35 but did not commence the takeoff roll for some time. In the meantime another flight had been cleared to land on runway 30 crossing runway 35 about 860 meters/2800 feet down runway 35. When the ATR finally began their takeoff roll tower recognized a possible conflict and instructed the ATR to reject takeoff. The crew rejected takeoff at low speed.Virgin Australia confirmed the incident stating that it wasn't serious enough to be investigated. The aircraft was at about 10-20kph (5-10 knots) when the captain applied gradual braking and stopped with a significant distance to the crossing runway remaining. The aircraft took off shortly after.
A Star Peru British Aerospace BAe 146-200, registration OB-1885-P performing flight 2I-1181 from Cuzco to Puerto Maldonado (Peru) with 59 people on board, rejected takeoff from Cuzco and came to a stop about half way down the runway with the outboard left hand main gear tyre deflated. Emergency services responded, the passengers disembarked onto the runway and were bussed to the terminal.The airport was closed for about 3 hours until the aircraft was moved back to the apron.The airline reported the crew rejected takeoff due to a mechanical/operational problem. Cuzco features a runway 10/28 of 3,397 meters/11150 feet length at elevation 3,310 meters/10,860 feet.The tyres being looked at (Photo: Andina/Percy Hurtado):
A Fedex Federal Express McDonnell Douglas MD-10-30, registration N304FE performing flight FX-977 from Portland,OR to Oakland,CA (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Portland when at about 60 knots the left hand engine (CF6) stalled associated with high vibration and high exhaust gas temperatures. The crew rejected takeoff and pulled the fire handle for the left hand engine, but did not discharge fire agent. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.An inspection revealed no damage/penetration to the engine cowling and no damage to the airframe.On May 22nd 2013 the NTSB released their factual report stating, that when during examination the fan of the left hand engine was manually rotated, the low pressure turbine did not rotate with it, the low pressure turbine could not be moved for being seized. Further inspection revealed penetration holes and tears in the low pressure turbine case and another hole was found in the turbine rear frame.Disassembly of the engine revealed that the fan mid shaft had fractured, the center vent tube and high pressure compressor air duct were also fractured. All low pressure turbine blades showed tip fractures. All engine main line bearings were intact except for bearing #7 which was found seized despite being wet with oil. The NTSB stated: "Five of the No. 7 bearing roller elements were missing and all the remaining roller elements were heat discolored black and most were flattened. The No. 7 bearing cage was damaged and heat discolored but was intact. The inner race aft edge was damaged and material was rolled."Debris found inside the engine were identified ester based engine oil residue typically found in turbine engines. The engine manufacturer concluded, "that the stress corrosion cracking observed on the fan mid shaft was caused primarily due to the breakdown of a synthetic oil product inside the FMS during both storage and engine operation".The NTSB reported: "The LPT stage 2 and 3 interstage seals installed in the engine were the new configuration that were recommended by Safety Board Recommendation A-98-125, introduced by GE SB CF6-50 72-1268, and mandated by Airworthiness Directive AD 2005-26-06 to address safety concerns that when a FMS separation occurs it leads to a LPT stage 1 disk overspeed and uncontained failure."On Sep 21st 2013 the NTSB released their final report concluding the probable cause of the incident was:The fracture of the fan mid shaft due to a stress corrosion cracking initiated by local regions of corrosion pitting, which resulted from oil migration within the shaft and its subsequent degradation.
A Swiss European Airlines Avro RJ-100, registration HB-IXT performing flight LX-434 from Geneva (Switzerland) to London City,EN (UK), was rotating for takeoff from Geneva's runway 05 when a private Cessna 210 overflew the runway on a perpendicular heading. Upon being handed off to departure the Swiss crew inquired with tower whether it was normal that the small aircraft would cross the runway just in front of them, tower replied in the negative, the crew advised they would file a safety report. Both aircraft continued to their destinations for safe landings.The Swiss SUST reported that an investigation has been opened into the occurrence, that SUST described as: "Close encounter between two aircraft in CTR Geneva airspace D. One aircraft in IFR was taking off on RWY 05 when the other aircraft in VFR was overflying in front, middle of RWY."
An Austrian Airlines Airbus A321-100, registration OE-LBC performing flight OS-415 from Vienna (Austria) to Paris Charles de Gaulle (France) with 188 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Vienna's runway 29 already at high speed when a loud bang occurred followed by the crew rejecting takeoff. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.According to a passenger the crew announced they had suffered a bird strike and rejected takeoff at about 200kph/107 KIAS. The flight was subsequently cancelled due to the aircraft being inoperative, the passengers were rebooked onto a later flight that was operated by a Boeing 777.The airline confirmed a bird strike prompted the crew to reject takeoff as a precaution, maintenance subsequently examined the aircraft but did not find any damage at the engines. The passengers were rebooked onto other flights.
An ANZ Air New Zealand Airbus A320-200, registration ZK-OJB performing flight NZ-846 from Sydney,NS (Australia) to Wellington (New Zealand), was accelerating for takeoff from Sydney's runway 34R when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 50 knots over ground) and vacated the runway advising tower they had normal operation.The aircraft was able to depart Sydney about 30 minutes later after the brakes had cooled.A passenger reported the captain announced they had a warning message, nothing serious, and needed to wait for the brakes to cool. About 20 minutes later the aircraft taxied to the holding point again and departed without further incident.
A Qantas Airbus A380-800, registration VH-OQH performing flight QF-11 from Sydney,NS (Australia) to Los Angeles,CA (USA), had just gotten airborne after takeoff from Sydney's runway 34L in gusting cross wind conditions when the crew of another aircraft advised tower that there appeared to be foreign objects on the runway, a second crew advised the taxiway signs had just been blown over when the Qantas A380 went past. An aircraft on approach was instructed to go around, runway 34L was closed. A crew reported it appeared as if something had exploded on the runway at the left hand side of the runway between taxiways A5 and L, just south of L when the Airbus A380 went past. A runway inspection was dispatched and reported the pavement of the runway had failed. Sydney tower subsequently advised all aircraft that runway 34L was unavailable for at least one hour, a number of departures requiring runway 34L returned to the apron, all other traffic was switched to runways 34R and 25.VH-OQH continued to Los Angeles for a safe landing.The airport returned to normal operation with both main runways 34L and 34R available about 5 hours later.Metars:YSSY 100500Z 29031KT CAVOK 32/M05 Q1000 RMK FU - VIS REDUCED TO N FM0500 MOD/SEV TURB BLW 5000FTYSSY 100430Z 29027G37KT CAVOK 32/M06 Q1000 RMK FU FM0430 MOD/SEV TURB BLW 5000FT FM0430 27020G30KT 9999 SCT070YSSY 100400Z 30023G37KT CAVOK 32/M07 Q1000 RMK FU FM0400 MOD/SEV TURB BLW 5000FT FM0400 27020G30KT 9999 SCT070YSSY 100336Z 30027G37KT CAVOK 33/M06 Q1000 RMK FU FM0336 MOD/SEV TURB BLW 5000FT FM0400 27020G30KT 9999 SCT070YSSY 100330Z 31028KT CAVOK 33/M05 Q1000 RMK FU FM0330 MOD/SEV TURB BLW 5000FT FM0400 27020G30KT 9999 SCT070 YSSY 100318Z 29027KT CAVOK 32/M04 Q1000 FM0318 MOD/SEV TURB BLW 5000FT FM0600 25020G30KT 9999 SCT070YSSY 100300Z 33017G27KT CAVOK 32/M01 Q1000 FM0300 MOD/SEV TURB BLW 5000FTYSSY 100230Z 33020G30KT CAVOK 31/M03 Q1001 FM0230 MOD/SEV TURB BLW 5000FTYSSY 100200Z 33024G34KT CAVOK 30/20 Q1002 RMK SHRA TO NW FM0200 MOD/SEV TURB BLW 5000FTYSSY 100135Z 33023G33KT CAVOK 29/18 Q1002 RMK SHRA TO NW FM0135 MOD/SEV TURB BLW 5000FTYSSY 100100Z 34028G38KT CAVOK 29/17 Q1003 FM0100 MOD/SEV TURB BLW 5000FT
An American Airlines Boeing 767-200, registration N324AA performing flight AA-180 from Los Angeles,CA to New York JFK,NY (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Los Angeles' runway 24L when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed due to receiving a unscheduled stab trim message though the stabilizer did not move, declined assistance and returned the aircraft to the apron, the crew did not report a reason for the rejected takeoff.A replacement Boeing 767-200 registration N328AA reached New York with a delay of 3 hours.A passenger reported the captain announced a "fairly important system" had malfunctioned. After the aircraft had returned to the gate, maintenance attempted to fix the problem with the passengers remaining on board, the captain provided an update every few minutes, in the end the passengers were told the aircraft had been taken out of service, disembarked and embarked a replacement aircraft.Another passenger confirmed the captain announced a system malfunction. 
A Southwest Airlines Boeing 737-700, registration N276WN performing flight WN-4273 from Flint,MI to Tampa,FL (USA) with 123 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Flint's runway 27 when the aircraft rolled through a flock of birds and suffered multiple bird impacts. The crew continued takeoff, barely acknowledged the tower instruction to contact departure and did not report on departure until the controller inquired whether they were on his frequency. The crew indicated they needed to return to Flint. The controller indicated he had some information to forward to them, reply "not now". About 3 minutes later the crew reported they went through a flock of birds just upon rotation, they were pretty busy. In the meantime tower initiated a runway inspection. The crew advised they needed nice easy turns and could not accept a sharp turn to intercept the localizer. The crew advised the controllers the "airplane simply didn't feel right", they lost a system or two and were trying to work it out during final approach. The runway inspection reported they couldn't see anything on the runway, but there were two dead birds looking like eagles south of runway 27 and east of runway 36 (editorial note: about 800 meters/2620 feet down the runway 27). The aircraft landed safely on Flint's runway 27 about 20 minutes after departure. The crew radioed tower after landing: "Thank you so much for all your help!"The airport swept the runway following landing before returning it to service.The FAA reported the aircraft received substantial damage and rated the occurrence an accident.A replacement Boeing 737-700 reached Tampa with a delay of 3:20 hours.
A Skywest Canadair CRJ-200 on behalf of United, registration N965SW performing flight OO-6506/UA-6506 from Albuquerque,NM to Los Angeles,CA (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from runway 03 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed, the crew reported a takeoff configuration warning. The aircraft slowed safely, vacated the runway and taxied towards the apron, however needed to stop about 200 meters short of the gate due to overheating brakes. Emergency services responded. After the brakes had cooled the aircraft continued taxi to the gate, where the passengers disembarked normally.The flight was cancelled, the passengers were rebooked onto other flights.A passenger reported that the aircraft was very close to begin rotation for takeoff when the aircraft decelerated. The aircraft turned off the runway and taxied to the gate, but stopped short of the gate, fire trucks appeared around the aircraft, firemen approached the aircraft and checked the gear. The aircraft sat in that position for about 25 minutes, then resumed taxi to the gate. The passengers were rebooked on other flights, as far as available on later flights the same day, a number of passengers onto flights the following morning.
A Lufthansa Canadair CRJ-900, registration D-ACKF performing flight LH-1667 from Sibiu (Romania) to Munich (Germany) with 88 passengers, was accelerating for takeoff out of Sibiu when the aircraft went through a flock of seagulls with two of the birds impacting the left hand wing. The crew continued takeoff but stopped the climb at safe altitude and returned to Sibiu for a safe landing.The aircraft received damage to the left hand wing. The passengers disembarked and waited in the terminal while the aircraft was being repaired. The aircraft was able to depart again after about 12 hours on the ground.The incident aircraft reached Munich as flight LH-1667 with a delay of 12 hours.
A LIAT de Havilland Dash 8-300, registration V2-LFV performing flight LI-774 from Georgetown (Guyana) to Bridgetown (Barbados) with 43 passengers, dropped one of the main wheels on takeoff from Georgetown. After assessing the situation the crew decided to continue the flight to Bridgetown for a safe landing with emergency services on stand by.The airline reported that the aircraft suffered a "main wheel failure" on takeoff, the aircraft continued to the destination where emergency services were called on standby as a precaution.

An Airbus Industries Airbus A300-600 Proto Super Transporteur, registration F-GSTA performing a freight flight from Toulouse (France) to Chester,EN (UK) with 3 crew, initiated takeoff from Toulouse's runway 14R in VMC, when the captain called during initial acceleration "FMA indications verified", the flight engineer confirmed the thrust levers had reached TOGA position. The first officer continued takeoff, rotated and after the aircraft settled in the initial climb commanded the gear up. At that point the commander noticed that the autothrust announciator no longer showed the expected "SRS" (Speed Reference System) mode but "THR L" (thrust lock). The flight director showed a pitch down command. The first officer moved the thrust lever which resolved the thrust lock to manual thrust mode, a subsequent re-engagement of autothrust resulted in SPD mode rather than SRS mode, the first officer prevented the thrust levers from retarding, then disengaged autothrust and autopilot. The climb was manually continued to 3500 feet, then the automation was re-engaged and the flight continued to destination without further incident and landed safely in Chester.The French BEA released their final report in French concluding the probable causes of the incident were:Lack of detection by the crew while monitoring announciators, that TAKE OFF mode had not engaged during takeoff roll.The failure of not engaging in TAKE OFF mode probably was due to erratic wiring.The BEA analysed that based on flight data recordings the crew were never shown the requested/required autopilot and autothrust modes, during the takeoff run they were shown: "THR L", "V/S" and "HDG". On the next flight, without occurrence, the announciators showed: "THR", "SRS" and "HDG SEL", the second next flight showed "THR", "SRS" and "RWY". Hence the takeoff mode was never active for the incident flight, and the engines never reached commanded takeoff thrust.This FDR recordings were in disagreement with recollection by the crew, the captain specifically stated to have seen "THR" and "SRS" at the beginning of the takeoff run, the first officer could not recall particular modes.The BEA reported that the Thrust Control Computer, the Thrust Levers and associated switches were examined with no faults found, the occurrence could not be reproduced. However, another crew had reported a similiar occurrence on the very same aircraft on May 11th 2011. An examination following that occurrence also did not reveal any fault.Due to the wiring the only explanation of the failure to engage TAKEOFF mode despite TOGA being commanded is a faulty wiring between the thrust levers and buttons and the thrust control computer.Another case by another operator was identified to have been caused by a temporary disturbance of the localizer signal during the takeoff run.There were no specific procedures established for a case where TAKEOFF mode would disengage/fall back during the takeoff run after the initial verification call. The correct response would be to either reject takeoff upon discretion of the commander if below 100 knots or engage GO AROUND mode, which would, if the aircraft is still on the ground, effectively engage TAKE OFF mode again or if airborne engage the GO-AROUND mode.
An Adria Airways Canadair CRJ-900, registration S5-AAO performing flight JP-117 from Frankfurt/Main (Germany) to Ljubljana (Slovenia), was accelerating for takeoff from Frankfurt's runway 18 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed. The aircraft returned to the apron.The incident aircraft was able to depart later and reached Ljubljana with a delay of one hour.A passenger reported that a chime was heard from the cockpit when the aircraft accelerated past the fire station about 1100 meters down the runway, the takeoff was rejected with the crew applying soft manual braking. The crew announced a problem with "air condition and pressure", the passenger was not entirely sure to have correctly understood the announcement, the crew added the takeoff was rejected as a precaution. The aircraft returned to the apron, emergency services responded and cooled the brakes for about 15-20 minutes. Following another brakes check the aircraft taxied again to runway 18 and departed without further incident.
A Luxair Boeing 737-700, registration LX-LGR performing flight LG-881 from Luxembourg (Luxembourg) to Heraklion (Greece), rejected takeoff from Luxembourg and returned to the apron.The flight was postponed to the next morning. A replacement Boeing 737-700 registration LX-LGQ reached Heraklion with a delay of 14 hours.The airline confirmed the aircraft rejected takeoff due to some technical problem, maintenance is currently examining the aircraft.The incident aircraft is still on the ground about 24 hours after rejecting takeoff.
A UTAir Ukraine Avion de Transport Regional ATR-42-300, registration UR-UTF performing flight QU-508 from Kiev Zhulhany to Lugansk (Ukraine), was accelerating for takeoff when starting at 37 knots the parameters of left and right hand engine began to differ with the left hand engine showing less torque but higher InterTurbine Temperatures. The crew began to assess the situation until the commander decided to reject takeoff at about 90 knots (V1=103 knots), the aircraft reached a maximum speed of 96 knots. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.Ukraine's State Aviation Service reported in their (delayed) monthly bulletin for March, that a subsequent engine run showed normal engine parameters for both engines. Upon recommendation by the airport engineering staff the engine was examined in more detail and a soft cover of dark green colour was found in the air intake. A following investigation established that the soft cover had been used as engine cover not meeting regulatory requirements, which require such engine covers to be red and feature a red pennant. The flight crew should verify that the air intakes are free of any foreign objects, the dark green colour, darkness and the lack of a step ladder however prevented the detection of the cover. The investigation determined that the input guide vanes of the left hand engines were blocked by the foreign object preventing the engine to accelerate normally but increase the temperature to critical values. The occurrence was rated a serious incident as result of the investigation.
A UTAir Ukraine Avion de Transport Regional ATR-72-500, registration UR-UTH performing flight QU-203 from Kharkov (Ukraine) to Baku (Azerbaidjan), was accelerating through 60 knots for takeoff when the takeoff configuration warning sounded prompting the captain to reject takeoff. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.Ukraine's State Aviation Service reported in their delayed monthly newsletter that the trim setting had been computed at 1.5 units, however had been set to 1.7 units. The investigation revealed that the scale was done in a way that depending on pilot's viewing angle a misreading of the indications of up to 0.25 units could occur. While the aircraft was taxiing for takeoff the commander raised doubt about the trim setting and increased the trim setting reaching 2.54 units. The takeoff configuration warning is set to issue an alert if the trim setting is below 0 units or above 2.5 units.
An Allegiant McDonnell Douglas MD-83, flight G4-662 from Orlando Sanford,FL to Lexington,KY (USA) with 163 passengers and 6 crew, rejected takeoff from Orlando Sanford after the left hand engine failed axially ejecting debris onto the runway (contained failure).

The crew continued takeoff, climbed the aircraft to safe altitude, shut the engine down and returned to Zaporozhye for a safe landing.Ukraine's Ministry of Transport reported in their monthly bulletin that a subsequent examination of the aircraft and data recorders showed, there were no air pressure values for the left hand engine over a period of 5 seconds starting 28 seconds after the takeoff was initiated. No anomalies with the engine, its systems and engine control were found. The investigation commission determined the cause of the indications was the temporary failure of the sensor measuring the air pressure at the compressor.

A Delta Airlines Boeing 767-300, registration N188DN performing flight DL-2364 from Honolulu,HI to Los Angeles,CA (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Honolulu's runway 08R when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed, tower reported smoke from the right main gear, later the left main gear tyres appear deflated, there was no smoke anymore. Emergency services responded, the aircraft was disabled on the runway. Emergency services reported they were extinguishing the right hand main gear, there was still smoke from the right main, the left main tyres were deflated, later reporting all right and all left main gear tyres had deflated and requested the aircraft to be shut down, emergency services advised no evacuation was necessary, there was no fire and the smoke had subsided, the crew advised they were still showing hot right brakes.The FAA reported the aircraft blew tyres on a rejected takeoff, the passengers deplaned onto the runway and were bussed to the terminal. 
A Manx2/VanAir Let L-410, registration OK-ASA performing flight NM-116 from Isle of Man to Blackpool,EN (UK) with 10 passengers and 2 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from runway 26 with the captain (40, ATPL, 3,221 hours total, 2,827 hours on type) being pilot flying. Upon reaching Vr (81 knots) the captain initiated rotation when both flight crew heard a loud noise, the captain checked the engine instruments which showed no abnormal indication, there was no yaw and no abnormal aircraft behaviour, the aircraft had become airborne in the meantime. The captain retarded both power levers to idle, descended the aircraft back onto the runway for a touchdown close to the intersection with runway 03/21 and slowed the aircraft to taxi speed before the end of the runway. Maximum speed over ground was 101 knots. The aircraft vacated the runway at the end of runway 26, the noise was still present though at lower level. The aircraft taxied to the apron, was shut down, passengers disembarked normally. Another aircraft on approach was instructed to go-around, a runway inspection found no debris on the runway.The United Kingdom's Air Accident Investigation Board (AAIB) released their bulletin into the serious incident releasing following summary:The source of the noise heard by the crew during the takeoff was traced to damage in the gas generator and power turbine stages of the left engine, caused by a broken balance plug released from the centrifugal compressor disc. The damage sustained by the engine was not sufficient to cause a significant loss of power and therefore the usual cues for the flight crew of an engine failure, loss of power and associated yaw, were missing. The flight crew were also startled by the level of noise, as it was outside of any of their previous experience.The commander suspected a failure of the left engine but was not certain as to what had happened. Realising that there was sufficient runway ahead to land the aircraft safely, he decided to close the power levers and abort the takeoff.The AAIB reported that the flight data recorder was retrieved and downloaded, the data contained 76 but not the incident flight. The cockpit voice recorder did contain the incident flight, however the cockpit area microphone suffered a fault attenuating the recordings.The day after the occurrence an inspection of the left hand engine revealed no external evidence of damage or leaks, however, when the propeller was turned manually a metallic rubbing noise was heard from the power turbine section of the engine. No other defects were identified. The left hand engine was removed from the aircraft and sent to the engine manufacturer for further analysis. The manufacturer identified a balance plug had broken and had been released from the centrifugal compressor disc. The plug had travelled along the gas path through the engine causing damage to the centrifugal compressor, the gas generator, power turbine nozzle guide vanes and turbine blades as well as 9 intermediate turbine temperature (ITT) thermocouples. The damage was insufficient to cause a significant loss of engine power. The balance plug had failed due to a fatigure crack that developed originating from the thread root of the plug's uppermost screw thread. The AAIB stated: "The engine manufacturer identified either insufficient assembly torque or ineffective securing of the plug after installation as possible causes for the balance plug becoming loose."Location of the detached balance plug (Photo: AAIB):Damage to gas generator at top and power turbine (Photos: AAIB):

An Air Europa Airbus A330-200, registration EC-JPF performing flight UX-71 from Madrid,SP (Spain) to Caracas (Venezuela) with 196 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Madrid's runway 36L about 29 minutes after Aeromexico's Boeing 767-200, see Accident: Aeromexico B762 at Madrid on Apr 16th 2013, tail strike on takeoff, when the aircraft rolled over debris left behind by the Boeing. Being above V1 the crew continued takeoff and in the absence of initially any unusual indications the crew climbed the aircraft to initial cruise level 310. About one hour into the flight, nearly over Lisbon (Portugal), the crew then decided to return to Madrid, descended the aircraft to FL100 to burn off fuel and entered a hold for about 3 hours before landing back on Madrid's runway 18R about 4.5 hours after departure.Spain's CIAIAC is investigating both occurrences.On May 3rd 2013 the CIAIAC reported, that EC-JPF was the 7th aircraft to depart following Aeromexic's Boeing 767-200. When the aircraft accelerated for takeoff about 29 minutes after the departure of the Aeromexico Boeing, the crew thought they had rolled over some debris and notified ATC during initial climb reporting their left nose wheel showed no tyre pressure. Following the notification runway 36L was inspected and metallic debris was recovered. The crew of another aircraft departing just prior to EC-JPF (6th departure after Aeromexico) had also reported seeing debris on the runway to ATC. The crew declared PAN, entered a hold, and returned to Madrid for a safe landing, the aircraft - apart from the tyre damage - sustained no damage.
An Air Canada Embraer ERJ-190, registration C-FMYV performing flight AC-225 from Calgary,AB to Vancouver,BC (Canada) with 102 people on board, rejected takeoff from Calgary's runway 28 when a strong odour and white smoke appeared in the cockpit. The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway, emergency services responded, the smoke dissipated after the engine thrust had been reduced to idle.The Canadian TSB reported maintenance identified the left hand air cycle machine as source of the odour and smoke and replaced the machine, the recirculation fans and filters. Following engine grounds runs went without residual odour.

A Germanwings Airbus A319-100, registration D-AKNN performing flight 4U-2141 from Moscow Vnukovo (Russia) to Cologne (Germany), was accelerating through about 120 knots for takeoff from Vnukovo's runway 01 when the crew detected the indicated airspeeds on the left hand and right hand primary flight displays differed by about 15-20 knots and further noticed the standby speed indicator was about 40 knots different. The takeoff was continued, during climbout the crew received messages indicating ADR1 and ADR faults. The crew declared emergency, considering the weather at Moscow and other alternatives the crew however decided to divert to Prague (Czech Republic). The aircraft climbed to FL320 and landed safely on Prague's runway 06 about 170 minutes after departure.Czech's Accident Investigating Institute UZPLN reported in their quarterly bulletin, that maintenance worked the relevant troubleshooting manuals but found no anomalies with the pitot tubes and hoses leading to the air data reference units. The troubleshooting manuals finally led to the discovery of a faulty air data module as well as a defective standby altimeter.Pitot system (Graphics: UZPLN):

A TAP Air Portugal Airbus A320-200, registration CS-TNG performing flight TP-945 from Geneva (Switzerland) to Lisbon (Portugal), was cleared for takeoff from Geneva's runway 23, the crew used English for communication with tower.At the time of the takeoff clearance an Air France Airbus A321-100, registration F-GTAE performing flight AF-1242 from Paris Charles de Gaulle (France) to Geneva (Switzerland), was on ILS approach to runway 23 about 3nm from the runway threshold, the crew using French to talk to tower had been told by tower to expect a late landing clearance. When the Air France Airbus was 0.5nm from the runway threshold at a height of approximately 300 feet (altitude of approx. 1600 feet) the crew received a windshear alert and went around however not without losing some height initially. The separation between the two aircraft reduced to 300 feet vertically and 1.3nm laterally before the conflict was resolved.On Mar 9th 2011 Portugal's GPIAA released the final report issued by Swiss BFU, the Swiss BFU website did not contain the final report until Mar 1st 2013. The Swiss BFU concluded:The serious incident is due to a critical convergence of an aircraft in go-around phase and an aircraft taking off, in consequence of an inadequate separation.A contributing factor was a windshear alert which caused a go-around initiated nearby the threshold of the runway.The BFU reported that all requirements for a reduced runway separation of 2400 meters laterally between the aircraft were fulfilled at the time of the occurrence and the tower controller was applying reduced runway separation.The Air France Airbus A321 had reported on tower in French while 9nm out and had been instructed to report again at 2nm out.When the A321 was 3nm out tower cleared the TAP A320 for takeoff, communication between tower and the TAP crew went in English.When the A321 was about 0.5nm out the crew encountered a fairly severe windshear alert with an associated loss of airspeed at about 300 feet above ground (1600 feet MSL). The crew applied an emergency maneouver, applying full thrust and rotating the nose up, to arrest the resulting "discernable plunge", and reported going around. The tower instructed the A321 to climb to 7000 feet on runway heading and instructed the A320 to stop the climb at 5000 feet. At that time the departing A320 had not yet reached a point 2400 meters down the runway (reduced runway separation).About 17 seconds later the A321 climbed through 2300 feet at an airspeed of 187 KIAS, trailing the TAP A320 which was climbing through 1800 feet at 178 KIAS about 1.4nm ahead of the A321. The Air France crew commented later in their air safety report that they had visual contact to the preceding A320 and rated the convergence of the aircraft "disturbing".Following coordination between tower controller and approach control the tower then instructed the Air France A321 to turn left onto a heading of 180 degrees 47 seconds after the go-around.The separation between the aircraft reduced to 300 feet vertical and 1.3nm lateral according to radar data before the conflict was resolved.The TAP A320 reached Lisbon without further incident. The Air France A321 landed safely on their second equally turbulent approach, that however did not encounter a windshear.The BFU reported, that there had been no indication or prediction of windshear prior to the go-around of the Air France A321, neither weather services nor pilots had reported any indication of windshear.The BFU analysed that in case of a late go-around in conjunction with a takeoff from the same runway tower must re-establish separation of 1000 feet vertical or 3nm lateral. When applying reduced runway separation the tower has to implement an avoidance maneouver for the aircraft going around to ensure that separation between the two departing aircraft still exists according to required separation minima. Tower therefore has to assign a flight path which diverges the aircraft and keeps the aircraft clear of obstacles.A right hand turn as stated in the missed approach procedures could not have assigned being prohibited between within 3nm from the Geneva VOR. The left hand turn as assigned was an appropriate solution, however, should have been accompanied by a climb rate limitation to the Air France A321. Both crews should have received traffic advisories by tower, who omitted such information in his transmissions.The BFU further analysed that the form of the resolution of a conflict from a late go-around and a departure is left to the controller's discretion resulting in controller decisions that are both manifold and different, the instructions in terms of heading, speed and altitude being the result of decisions taken in an urgent situation.Re-establishing separation standards following a late go-around near the runway threshold with a departure in progress while applying reduced runway separation criteria however may prove problematic because of the topographical environment in Geneva, that necessitates the rapid acquisition of minimum altitude under radar guidance.The BFU therefore voices the opinion that a standard alternative go-around procedure should be established to de-conflict a late go-around and a departure, this procedure should be instructed and trained by tower controllers.Weather information had not indicated any possibility of storms in the area of Geneva although isolated stable, non-moving storm cells were forecasted across Switzerland and France. At the time of the occurrence large and developing cloud were observed above Geneva, storm clouds however had disappeared. The BFU could not rule out however that a few isolated vortices of air caused by the formation of clouds over high ground moved towards the approach sector and caused perceptible windshear.

Japan's Transportation Safety Board (JTSB) released their final report concluding the probable cause of the serious incident was:In this serious incident, during the airplanes after-takeoff climb, a section of the cooling ring in the combustion chamber of the engine was fractured due to the progress of fatigue cracks, and the fractured piece went downstream to damage the fast-rotating turbine blades and other parts, resulting in the circumferential turbine blade damage on several downstream turbine stages.The JTSB reported that the aircraft was climbing through 6700 feet when a loud noise was heard from the left hand engine, the interturbine temperature (ITT) exceeded 950 degrees C and the engine lost power. The engine was shut down and the crew returned to Itami Airport.A post flight inspection revealed blade damage along various turbine stages. The combustion chamber and high pressure turbine had accumulated 3,415 hours in 4,820 cycles since last overhaul/replacement with new parts. Examination revealed that the fuel nozzles showed no anomaly, the cooling ring attached to the combustion chamber outer line showed fatigue cracks in the circumferential and axial directions at several locations. A section of the ring was missing. All 38 high pressure turbine blades were fractured just above the platform as result of impact damage, all 53 low pressure turbine blades showed damage at the tips as result of impact, the 66 first stage and 71 second stage power turbine blades as well as vanes were fractured. The fractures were confirmed as impact damage, too, some intershaft rubbing was determined.The JTSB analysed: "As the fracture surface of the bases of the HPT blades indicated the cause of fracture by impact, it is very likely that the missing section of the cooling ring was carried into the HPT area by the combustion gas to strike against the fast-rotating HPT blades or to be caught between the HPT blades and vanes. This generated fractured HPT blades and broken pieces and they further damage the other components leading to the whole circumference. The downstream LPT and PT stages were very likely damaged by broken fragments of the HPT blades and others coming from the upstream."The missing section of the cooling ring (Photo: JTSB):The exhaust duct showing damaged power turbine blades (Photo: JTSB):
An Aer Arann Avion de Transport Regional ATR-72-500 on behalf of Aer Lingus, registration EI-REL performing flight RE-3227/EI-3227 from Glasgow,SC (UK) to Dublin (Ireland), rejected takeoff from Glasgow's runway 05 due to a blown tyre. The aircraft slowed safely and was able to vacate the runway onto taxiway A before becoming disabled while attempting to return to the apron. An arriving Emirates Boeing 777-300 taxiing to the apron was caught on the taxiway behind the ATR-72 and had to wait until the ATR had been towed to the apron.Flight RE-3227 was cancelled.
An Ak Bars Aero Canadair CRJ-200, registration VQ-BHG performing flight BGM-569 from St. Petersburg to Bugulma (Russia) with 44 people on board, rejected takeoff from St. Petersburg due to an indication of overheating wing anti-ice system. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.
A United Boeing 767-200, registration N68159 performing flight UA-97 from Berlin Tegel (Germany) to Newark,NJ (USA), rejected takeoff from Berlin at high speed (about 100 knots), the aircraft slowed safely, emergency services responded and checked the brakes before the aircraft returned to the gate.The flight was cancelled.A passenger had had originally been booked on flight UA-97 of Feb 9th, the rotation UA-96/97 had however been cancelled due to the snow storm disrupting the East Coast of the USA. Rebooked onto the following day's flight the passenger reported the aircraft needed to reject takeoff at high speed, the captain announced at first they had hit something on the runway but later stated the left hand engine (CF6) had failed, emergency services were checking for a possible brakes fire. The passenger was subsequently rebooked onto a flight via London Heathrow,EN (UK).
An American Airlines Boeing 737-800, registration N916AN performing flight AA-1021 from Dallas Ft. Worth,TX to Las Vegas,NV (USA) with 115 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from runway 18L when a loud bang was emitted by the right hand engine, tower reported fire from the right hand engine, the crew rejected takeoff at about 60 knots, pulled the fire handle and discharged a fire bottle. The crew reported they had an engine fire indication, tower reported the fire seemed to have gone, no flames visible anymore stating that there were flames visible prior to that, emergency services were already responding. The aircraft stopped on the runway for an inspection by emergency services and subsequently taxied to the gate.Runways 18L was closed for a runway inspection.A replacement Boeing 737-800 registration N925AN reached Las Vegas with a delay of 3 hours.The right hand engine of the incident aircraft needed to be replaced.
A Batavia Boeing 737-300, registration PK-YVZ performing flight Y6-206 from Pontianak to Jakarta (Indonesia) with 112 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff on Pontianak's runway 15, when immediately after rotation for takeoff began a loud bang was heard following by aircraft vibration and a yaw to the right. The captain (48, ATPL, 16,325 hours total, 10,587 hours on type), pilot flying, continued the takeoff. During the initial climb, after selecting the gear up, the left hand main gear continued to indicate red (unsafe), attempts to recycle the gear did not succeed. The flight attendant confirmed hearing a bang and feeling vibrations, the captain asked a company engineer, travelling as passenger on the flight, to the cockpit. The engineer checked the actual gear position through a viewing window in the passenger cabin and found the left main gear was in its usual position, however there was still some dim light in the wheel well area which normally would be entirely dark.The captain inquired with Pontianak tower, the tower reported a dead deer had been found on the runway near taxiway D.After assessing the situation the crew decided to continue the flight to Jakarta and requested emergency services on stand by upon arrival in Jakarta in case of unexpected condition during landing.The aircraft flew an approach to Jakarta's runway 25L without further event and touched down normally with manual braking only about 70 minutes after departure, during the roll out however serious vibrations occurred and the aircraft swayed left and right of the runway center line. The crew stopped the aircraft safely at the end of the runway. The engineer disembarked to assess the damage, but reported there was no visible damage.When after about 25 minutes no stairs and busses were available although requested to disembark the passengers, the airline decided to have the aircraft towed to the gate with passengers on board, the aircraft was towed to the apron about 35 minutes after landing.Indonesia's NTSC released their preliminary report stating the first officer (41, CPL, no experience data provided) was pilot monitoring on that sector.The aircraft received minor damage in the deer strike, both left hand wheels were damaged, the left hand main gear shimmy damper was fractured, the left hand main gear lower torsion link was fractured, left hand main gear door was missing, left main gear center fractured, left inboard spoiler bent, left main gear anti-skid wiring harness broken, lower wing access panel and support panel broken.Map (Graphics: NTSC):
A Qantas Boeing 767-300, registration VH-ZXF performing flight QF-545 from Brisbane,QL to Sydney,NS (Australia), was rotating for takeoff from Brisbane's runway 01 when the tail of the aircraft contacted the runway surface. The crew continued the takeoff, stopped the climb at 3000 feet and returned to Brisbane for a safe landing 01 about 15 minutes after departure.The airline confirmed a very minor tail strike. All passengers were rebooked onto other flights.Following checks the aircraft departed Brisbane about 3 hours after landing as flight QF-6124 to Sydney and resumed service the following morning.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/QFA545/history/20130131/0625Z/YBBN/YSSY
A Sata International Airbus A310-300 on behalf of Tap Air Portugal, registration CS-TGU performing flight TP-254 from Sao Tome Island (Sao Tome) to Lisbon (Portugal) with 157 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff when an engine (CF6) ingested a large bird prompting the crew to reject takeoff at high speed. The aircraft slowed safely, a number of tyres deflated however.A replacement aircraft is estimated to reach Lisbon with a delay of 25 hours.
An Austrian Airlines Airbus A319-100, registration OE-LDC performing flight OS-152 from Dusseldorf (Germany) to Vienna (Austria) with 108 passengers and 5 crew, rejected takeoff from Dusseldorf at low speed due to a failed pitot heating controller. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The flight was cancelled, the passengers were rebooked onto other flights.The incident aircraft was able to position to Innsbruck (Austria) about 5 hours later.The airline reported the crew aborted takeoff due to a defective probe heat controller and returned to the gate. A passenger reported that the engines were accelerating for takeoff but did not reach takeoff thrust when the takeoff was rejected at low speed. The aircraft rolled to the next turn off and returned to the apron. The crew announced they had an electrical problem in the cockpit.
A Delta Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-90, registration N932DN performing flight DL-2101 from Boston,MA to Atlanta,GA (USA), had lined up on runway 33L awaiting takeoff clearance when the crew advised they had a little problem with the right hand brakes that appeared stuck. The aircraft was instructed to taxi down runway 33L to return to the gate, while moving slowly the crew requested emergency services to attend the aircraft due to the brakes becoming "really hot". The crew of another aircraft radioed the right main gear appeared on fire and the tyres may have been blown. The crew stopped the aircraft on the spot and shut the aircraft down, the smoke off the brake subsided. After emergency services arrived the passengers disembarked onto the runway via stairs and were bussed to the terminal.Runway 33L was closed while emergency services responded until the aircraft was towed clear of the runway.Following repairs the aircraft was able to depart and reached Atlanta with a delay of 7 hours.N932DN taxiing slowly down runway 33L with right brakes dragging (Photo: Tkolos):
A Norwegian Air Shuttle Boeing 737-300, registration LN-KKZ performing flight DY-6347 from Amsterdam (Netherlands) to Copenhagen (Denmark), had been cleared for takeoff from Amsterdam's runway 24. About 15 seconds after the aircraft became airborne and had overflown their vehicle at about 1000 feet AGL the crew of a bird patrol vehicle on the runway notified ground control they had just vacated the runway, at which point the runway incursion was recognized. The Boeing 737 continued the flight to Copenhagen for a safe landing.Netherland's Onderzoeksraad (DSB - Dutch Safety Board) released their final report in Dutch concluding the probable causes of the serious incident were:Direct causes:the tower controller issued a takeoff clearance to the Boeing 737 after another aircraft had crossed the runway however overlooked a bird patrol vehicle, which had previously been cleared to enter the runway for bird scare duties. The overall situation awareness of the tower controller was reduced as he had no direct contact to all vehicles and aircraft around his runway, when he checked the runway visually he did not see the car near the runway end. The "runway occupied" strip does not distinguish whether one or more vehichles/aircraft are occupying the runway. - the departing aircraft, crossing aircraft and vehicles operated on different frequencies- the crossing traffic was not on tower frequency- the term "active runway" is not unambiguously defined in the procedures- the "runway occupied" markers do not provide an indication how many vehicles and/or aircraft are on the runway- in the recommendations for air traffic control there is no procedure for the use of "runway occupied" strip and flight strips. As a result, these tools in combination with the electronic runway occupied panel are not optimally used. (Underlying cause of runway incursions)Underlying causes of runway incursions- at Schiphol Airport bird patrols (or tower controllers) must wait and make decisions between safety and runway capacity while conducting runway inspections.- at Schiphol Airport not all traffic on the runways are on the relevant tower frequency deviating from recommendations by ICAO and EASA as well as from other major European Airports- at Schiphol Airport bird patrols are expected to monitor a number of frequencies simultaneously while performing runway inspections. This is an unreasonable requirement. In addition, by having bird patrols wait an unbalanced relation with ATC arises, which may adversely affect communication- the guidelines put in effect for bird partrol how often active runways should be checked are sufficiently clear- the current tools for tower controllers, the electronic runway occupied indication as well as the runway occupied strip together with flight strips, reduce the risk of runway incursions, however not always- Safety is one of the biggest concern of Netherland's air traffic control. On the aspect of preventing runway incursions with a bird patrol involved the risks are not adequately controlled however. This is in part the result of lack of cooperation between the two parties and little awareness of the risks. Although all parties to Dutch Aviation cooperate to ensure aviation safety, e.g. in the Schiphol Safety Platform, these activities are insufficient for all parties to take adequate management measures- the separate investigation into the Dec 18th 2010 runway incursion by Air Traffic Control focussed only on the direct cause of the runway incursion but did not investigate underlying causes. The Schiphol Safety Platform also has no mandate for a thorough investigation of the underlying causes of runway incursions- the safety management of both Schiphol Airport and Air Traffic Control have not yet led to a runway management that prevents runway incursions with bird patrols being involved or at least leads to a substantial reduction of such runway incursions- there has been no assessment been undertaken to try vehicles and aircraft on the active tower frequency controlling the active runway, and there is no effort in developing procedures for runway inspections by bird patrol - Only the Runway Incursion Alerting System Schiphol (RIASS) is available to warn about an active runway incursion, which means a safe guard against human error by the tower controller is effectively lacking- Runway inspections are not included in the capacity planning by Air Traffic Control. The balance between safety and capacity in conducting runway inspections thus is purely in the hands of bird patrol and controller on duty- the still limited cooperation between Schiphol Airport and Air Traffic Control in the fields of safety would require the involvement of Netherland's Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment to introduce a systematic and integral approach at Schiphol Airport to adequately address the risk of runway incursions- Weaknesses in the cooperation of Schiphol Airport and Air Traffic Control have not prompted action by the Inspectorate of Environment and Transport to visibly reduce these shortcomings- the shortcomings in the cooperation between Schiphol Airport and Air Traffic Control, although both organisations are required to cooperate by their certification, continue to exist despite the cooperation of both with the Schiphol Safety Platform.- the possibilities of coordination offered by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment to ensure quality of cooperation are underused.The crew of bird patrol vehicle KV2 contacted ground control, assistant 2, at 14:22Z to enter runway 24 for a bird patrol inspection of the runway and was cleared to enter the runway. The vehicle entered the runway at the threshold and drove down the runway at about 40kph.A minute later a Boeing 747 taxiing from Sierra de-icing platform requested clearance to cross runway 24 at taxiway S2 on a second ground control frequency and was also cleared by air traffic assistant 2 to cross the runway. The tower controller notified the bird patrol vehicle of the crossing 747 using the assistant's microphone, while the assistant was on the phone to perform coordination. The bird patrol vehicle stopped on the runway short of intersection with S2 waiting for the 747 to cross the runway.About 2 minutes after requesting to cross the runway the crew of the Boeing 747 reported clear of the runway on ground frequency, the bird patrol vehicle continued to drive down the runway.About 45 seconds after the 747 had reported clear of the runway LN-KKZ reported on tower frequency ready for departure and was subsequently cleared for takeoff from runway 24. The aircraft began its takeoff run 80 seconds after the Boeing 747 had reported clear, at that time the bird patrol vehicle just crossed intersection S1 about 1680 meters down the runway and about 620 meters short of the runway end driving at about 80kph.6 seconds after the takeoff run began, RIASS activated a runway incursion alert, the system however was active only in test mode, the alert therefore was not detectable by the tower controller. The aircraft had reached a speed of 44 knots at that time.32 seconds after the takeoff run began the aircraft became airborne, at that time the vehicle was about 1700 meters further down the runway, and climbed out overflying the vehicle near the runway end at about 1000 feet AGL. 15 seconds later the bird patrol crew notified ground control they had vacated the runway at which time the assistant realised the runway incursion.The DSB analysed that assistant 2 provided two clearances to enter the runway in coordination with the tower controller. First the bird patrol was cleared to enter runway 24 for a runway inspection, the runway occupied marker strip was placed and the electronic runway occupied signal activated. Second a Boeing 747 was cleared to cross the runway. After the Boeing 747 had vacated the runway again the strip marker and electronic indication "runway occupied" were cleared resulting in the tower controller issuing the takeoff clearance to the Boeing 737.While the runway occupied markers that way provide a safe guard with one aircraft or vehicle cleared onto the runway, the lack of information of how many vehicles and/or aircraft had been cleared onto the runway does not protect against multiple crossing clearances or multiple vehicles on the runway or vehicles on the runway with crossing aircraft.Eurocontrol recommends that for each traffic permitted onto the runway a separate strip marker "runway occupied" is to be placed. The DSB however annotated that there is no such recommendation for electronic runway occupied indications.Bird patrol was listening to ground control frequency and Schiphol operations frequency. The vehicle was equipped with a transponder making the vehicle visible on Schiphol's ground radar, and carried strobe lights. However, ground radar was rarely referred to in good visibility as present at the time of the runway incursion. Neither assistant nor controller nor anybody else noticed the vehicle on the runway, despite the active strobe lights, when the takeoff clearance was issued.The crew of the Boeing 737 did not see the bird patrol too, mainly attributed to the fact that the vehicle was driving in takeoff direction. The DSB analysed that the situation awareness of tower was compromised when the bird patrol vehicle was not transferred onto the tower frequency before clearing the vehicle onto the runway.The DSB analysed that situational awareness of tower was further compromised when the Boeing 747, other than prescribed by local procedures, were not transferred onto the tower frequency for crossing runway 24.This created the undesireable and unfavourable scenario that two aircraft and one car were on the runway, each transmitting on and monitoring a different frequency. Had all three been on the same frequency, each of them could have recognized the pending conflict and could have responded to a possible error by the controller or a pilot. That way an additional safe guard is being established.The moment LN-KKZ got airborne (Photo: DSB/NustyR Air Team Images photo stream):Excerpt Aerodrome Chart (Graphics: DSB):
An American Airlines Boeing 737-800, registration N832NN performing flight AA-634 from Santa Ana,CA to Dallas Ft. Worth,TX (USA) with 139 people on board, had just become airborne after takeoff from Santa Ana's runway 19R when the crew declared emergency reporting a bird had been ingested by an engine (CFM56) and requested a right hand pattern to divert to Los Angeles International Airport,CA. The aircraft climbed to 7000 feet and diverted to Los Angeles. Tower reported bird debris was found near the departure end of the runway. The aircraft landed safely on LAX's runway 25L about 16 minutes after departure.Santa Ana airport reported three birds impacted the aircraft during takeoff, the runway was closed for about 30 minutes until the runway had been inspected and the debris had been removed.
An American Airlines Boeing 757-200, registration N182AN performing flight AA-1201 from Miami,FL to Seattle,WA (USA), was accelerating for takeoff when the crew received a left wing tank fuel boost pump low pressure indication. The takeoff was continued, the crew decided to continue the flight to Dallas Ft. Worth, TX, where the aircraft landed safely about 2.5 hours later.A replacement Boeing 757-200 registration N695AN continued the flight and reached Seattle with a delay of 4:15 hours.The fuel boost pump needs to be replaced.
A Condor Boeing 757-300, registration D-ABOE performing flight DE-7982 from Frankfurt/Main (Germany) to Las Palmas,CI (Spain), was accelerating through 130 KIAs for takeoff from Frankfurt's runway 18 when a pungent odour was noticed on the flight deck, due to the speed the crew decided to continue takeoff however. During the climb the odour was also observed in the cabin, both pilots felt tickles in their limbs and gums prompting them to don their oxygen masks, stop the climb at FL250 and return to Frankfurt for a safe landing on runway 25L about 23 minutes later.The German BFU reported in their monthly bulletin that emergency services checked the aircraft on the taxiway, however no anomaly and no abnormal measurements of cabin air were found. Maintenance found the right hand engine's oil reservoirs had been overfilled by two quarts. A number of flight attendants suffered from symptoms of tickling legs/arms as well, all 9 crew members were taken to a hospital for medical assistance and assessment, urine and blood samples were taken.
A Jetstar Airbus A320-200, registration VH-JQX performing flight JQ-745 from Sydney,NS to Launceston,TA (Australia), was accelerating for a flex takeoff from Sydney's runway 16R when the right hand thrust lever was inadvertently pushed slightly forward of the FLX/MCT detent resulting in the left engine accelerating to Flex Takeoff Thrust and the right engine to the manual setting commanded by the lever. The pilot monitoring detected the manual thrust indication in his announciators and called "manual thrust, 80 knots, thrust not set", the pilot flying however did not correctly understand the call and believing the aircraft was accelerating normally continued the takeoff, however did not call out so. The pilot monitoring, waiting for the call, called "go" himself at about 130 KIAS (V1 and Vr at 150 KIAS) shortly followed by "TOGA", the pilot flying started rotation upon mishearding the "go ... Toga" as "rotate". He then realised they were still 20 knots below Vr and eased the nose to slow the rotation and permit the aircraft to accelerate to Vr without tail strike, the pilot monitoring pushed both levers into the TOGA detent as the pilot flying had already moved his hand off the thrust levers. The aircraft accelerated to the normal takeoff speed and the aircraft continued to Launceston without further incident.The Australian Transportation Safety Board released their final report concluding the probable cause of the incident was:Contributing safety factors- After the thrust levers were placed in the MCT/FLX detent, the right lever was inadvertently moved forward of the detent, which caused the autothrust system to revert to manual thrust mode.- The training captain recognised the thrust lever asymmetry situation, however the pilot flying did not, and this resulted in a miscommunication that was not resolved effectively between the crew.Other safety factor- The pilot flying misunderstood a command from the training captain and rotated the aircraft at a speed that was approximately 20 kts below the required rotation speed, which had the potential to result in a tailstrike.The ATSB reported the left hand seat was occupied by a captain under training (ATPL, 14,317 hours total, 120 hours on type) transferring from a Boeing 767 to the Airbus A320, the captain assuming the role of pilot flying for the sector (in the following called captain). The right hand seat was occupied by a training captain (ATPL, 9,343 hours, 4,957 hours on type) assuming the duties of the pilot monitoring and commander of the aircraft (in the following called commander).The ATSB reported that the Boeing 767 had a "thrust hold" mode which was thought equivalent to the manual thrust mode. Seeing the flex/manual thrust Flight Mode Announciator (FMA) indication the captain thus did not perceive anything abnormal.The FMA indicated a thrust lever asymmetry with one lever in a detent and the other out of the detent by a "LVR ASYM" FMA indication, this indication however is inhibited below 100 feet AGL.In a post flight interview the captain stated that he did not understand why the commander had called "thrust not set" as the man thrust indication did make sense to him in the phase of the flight and acceleration. He explained that the indication made sense to him as he viewed it similiar to the thrust hold mode on the 767.The ATSB wrote: "The PNF (commander), while using standard phraseology, did not effectively communicate his understanding of the thrust lever asymmetry situation to the PF (captain). In part this was due to the training environment that they were operating in, and that this situation was an opportunity for the training captain to assess the PFs actions in a non-normal event." The ATSB further expanded: "The lack of FMA annunciation for the thrust lever asymmetry in this event, due to the aircraft being below 100 ft, meant the PF did not easily recognise this scenario during the takeoff. He was aware that the lever asymmetry message would show in some conditions, but had not comprehended that there could be an asymmetry condition and no message would be displayed."After the commander realised the captain did not react to the lever asymmetry he called "Go ... TOGA" in order to signal the takeoff should continue with the levers in the TOGA detent, which would also resolved the asymmetry, however the captain misheard this as "rotate".
A Lufthansa Cargo McDonnell Douglas MD-11, registration D-ALCN performing flight GEC-8399/LH-8399 from Krasnojarsk (Russia ) to Frankfurt/Main (Germany), rejected takeoff due to a clogged fuel filter indication. The aircraft returned to the apron.Following maintenance the aircraft was able to depart 90 minutes later and reached Frankfurt with a delay of 60 minutes.
The NTSB released their factual report reporting the takeoff weight was 161,037 pounds with center of gravity at 22.5% MAC resulting in a V1 and Vr of 153 KIAS and a V2 of 158 KIAS with flaps selected to position 1.The aircraft accelerated for takeoff on runway 07L, when according to crew testimony an automated V1 call occurred about 20 knots early and the captain, pilot flying, began to rotate the aircraft. According to the flight data recorder the first control inputs to raise the nose occurred at 123 KIAS (30 knots early). The captain said in post flight interviews that after he realized the airspeed was too low he eased the nose wheel back onto the ground and rotated again at about 155 KIAS. The flight data recorder showed that the control colum inputs eased slightly after the aircraft had rotated to 7 degrees nose up, then commanded the nose up again until it reached about 11 degrees and the aircraft became airborne at 148 KIAS. Cabin crew expressed concern in flight that the aircraft may have suffered a tail strike on departure, the aircraft continued to Toronto however. Following landing damage to the tail skid was discovered, the crew made according log book entries.The aircraft was ferried to Tulsa for further examination, that revealed abrasions to the tail skid assembly and ancilliary components, repairs were needed to external fasteners, skin and related components. The examination also revealed the aft pressure bulkhead had buckled requiring a repair doubler to be placed around the damaged area together with 3 fillers. This bulkhead damage affected the structural integrity of the aircraft and was the reason for the NTSB's classification as accident.On Jan 16th 2013 the NTSB released their final report concluding the probable cause of the accident was:the early rotation of the airplane to an angle at which the fuselage contacted the runway. Contributing to early rotation was the Captains reaction to the erroneous V1 automated callout, likely assuming that the airplane was at or close to the correct Vr at the same time. The erroneous automated callout was likely due to a keystroke entry error by the FO when manually entering takeoff data for a newly assigned departure runway.
A Nordwind Boeing 767-300, registration VQ-BMQ performing flight NWS-2475 from Krasnojarsk (Russia) to Phuket (Thailand) with 279 passengers and 11 crew, was climbing out of Krasnojarsk's runway 29 when the crew received a takeoff configuration alert referring to flaps after selecting the flaps up. The crew stopped the climb at FL160, silenced the alert and master warning, entered a hold at FL070 to burn off fuel and returned to Krasnojarsk for a safe landing about 5 hours after departure.A replacement Boeing 767-300 registration VQ-BMC reached Phuket with a delay of 15 hours.Rosaviatsia reported on Jan 14th 2013 that upon selecting flaps up the takeoff configuration alert activated due to a malfunctioning air/ground sensor.
An American Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-82, registration N7537A performing flight AA-1243 from Charlotte,NC to Dallas Ft. Worth,TX (USA), rejected takeoff from runway 23, the crew reported they had a compressor stall on one of the engines (JT8). Another aircraft on short final was instructed to go around due to the rejected takeoff. The aircraft returned to the apron on own power.A passenger reported the right hand engine appeared to have failed while the aircraft accelerated for takeoff. The aircraft braked hard.The flight was cancelled.
A China Eastern Airbus A300-600, flight MU-5274 from Shenzhen to Shanghai Hongqiao (China), was accelerating for takeoff from Shenzhen when the crew discovered disagreeing airspeed indications and rejected takeoff at high speed. The aircraft stopped safely though with smoke off the main landing gear. Responding emergency services cooled the hot brakes.
An Aeroflot Airbus A320-200, registration VQ-BHN performing flight SU-1273 from Krasnodar to Moscow Sheremetyevo (Russia) with 134 passengers and 7 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Krasnodar's runway 05R when past V1 the crew observed birds. The takeoff was continued, however when the aircraft climbed through about 500 feet a burning smell developed inside the cockpit and cabin and engine (CFM56) vibration indications rose to 8.5 units. The crew stopped the climb at 1300 meters/4300 feet and returned to Krasnodar, without shutting an engine down, for a safe landing on runway 23L about 12 minutes after departure.Rosaviatsia reported a postflight inspection found 3 damaged blades in the left hand engine.
An American Airlines Boeing 757-200, registration N191AN performing flight AA-54 from Chicago O'Hare,IL (USA) to Manchester,EN (UK), was accelerating for takeoff from Chicago's runway 22L when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed. While turning off the runway the crew reported it appeared somebody had misplaced a bag and they needed medical assistance. The aircraft joined taxiway S and crossed runway 10 during taxi back to the gate.The FAA reported the aircraft aborted takeoff due to an injured flight attendant.The aircraft departed about one hour later and reached Manchester with a delay of 40 minutes.
A yellow-billed-kite at Limpopo in 2011(Photo: New Jersey Birds)A Comair Boeing 737-300 on behalf of British Airways, registration ZS-OKG performing flight MN-6324/BA-6324 from Durban to Port Elizabeth (South Africa) with 102 passengers, was struck by a yellow-billed kite while on takeoff from Durban beyond V1 at about 08:00L (06:00Z). The crew continued takeoff and in absence of abnormal indications continued the flight to Port Elizabeth, where the aircraft landed safely.A postflight inspection revealed a large dent at the aircraft nose. The damage caused ripple on effects throughout the Comair/British Airways South Africa Network causing delays of up to 5 hours during the evening of Jan 2nd. A passenger thus reported on South African aviation bulletin board AvCom the captain of his flight in the evening came out of the cockpit and facing the passengers made an announcement explaining their 4.5 hour delay with a bird strike at Port Elizabeth. The passenger quoted the captain subsequently stating: "I know some of you are irritable, and trust me we are in this together, but I will NOT take any nonesense from any unruly passengers who decide to give my cabin crew a hard time. Understood?", which had the cabin break into joyous applause.The incident aircraft was able to resume service the following day.On Jan 7th the airline confirmed a bird strike on flight MN-6324, the incident aircraft was replaced after landing in Port Elizabeth. The replacement aircraft had to be ferried in, which resulted in delays and impacted the flight schedule for the remainder of the day. The damage of ZS-OKG:
A Condor Boeing 757-300, registration D-ABOF performing flight DE-6894 from Dusseldorf (Germany) to Fuerteventura,CI (Spain), rejected takeoff from Dusseldorf due to an engine fire indication. The aircraft stopped safely, no trace of an engine fire was found. The passengers disembarked normally.A replacement Boeing 757-300 registration D-ABON departed about 2 hours later and reached Fuerteventura with a delay of 130 minutes.Passenger Cansitan Ayral reported the takeoff was rejected, the crew reported an engine fire indication. After the aircraft had reached the parking position the left hand engine's cowling was opened.D-ABOF after the rejected takeoff (Photo: Cansitan Ayral):
A Windrose Aviation Airbus A321-200, registration UR-WRI performing flight 7W-7148 from Dubai (United Arab Emirates) to Kiev (Ukraine), was accelerating for takeoff when the left hand engine's EGT rose to 695 degrees Centigrade (limit 650 degrees Centigrade) just prior to reaching V1. The crew rejected takeoff at high speed, the aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.Ukraine's Ministry of Transport reported in their monthly bulletin, that the engine electronic control was found faulty, which caused the full authority digital engine control to completely fail. The crew's non-detection of abnormal EGT readings of the left engine compared to the right hand engine during taxi and spool up of the engines contributed to the high speed abort.
A Kenn Borek Basler BT-67 (modified DC-3), registration C-GEAI performing a tour flight from Holtanna Peak to Novolazarevskaya Station (Antarctica) with 15 passengers and 2 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from the unprepared glacier surface at coordinates S71.921667 E8.298333, when the aircraft contacted a snow drift and became airborne at a speed that was insufficient to sustain flight. The aircraft stalled and fell back onto the surface resulting in the collapse of the main gear and minor injuries to two passengers. The aircraft came to a stop on its belly and sustained substantial damage.The occupants were accomodated in tents until another Kenn Borek Basler BT-67 picked them up later the day.The Canadian TSB is awaiting further information.Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):

A Skywest Canadair CRJ-200, registration N957SW performing flight OO-6191 from Bakersfield,CA to Denver,CO (USA), was climbing out of Bakersfield's runway 30R when the crew reported a bird strike right at rotation for takeoff while flying through a flock of about 10 small birds and requested to return to Bakersfield to have the aircraft inspected, some vibrations started some time after the bird strike. The aircraft stopped the climb at 16,000 feet and turned back to Bakersfield for a safe landing on runway 30R about 20 minutes after departure.The FAA reported the aircraft sustained minor damage.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/SKW6191/history/20121213/2300Z/KBFL/KDEN
A Skywest Canadair CRJ-200, flight OO-2679 from Los Angeles,CA to Salt Lake City,UT (USA), had been cleared for takeoff from runway 25R at 07:20L (15:20Z) and was accelerating for takeoff, when tower shouted another private aircraft to stop, the runway intrusion alert clearly audible in the background, and cancelled the takeoff clearance of OO-2679. The CRJ-200 rejected takeoff at low speed and slowed safely, the private Bombardier Challenger 300, that had landed on runway 24R earlier and taxied across the aerodrome, was cleared to cross runway 25R. The controller subsequently apologized to the crew of the CRJ-200 explaining another aircraft had crossed the runway without clearance.The CRJ-200 did not need assistance, returned to the holding point, departed about 30 minutes later and reached Salt Lake City with a delay of 25 minutes.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/SKW2679/history/20121212/1500Z/KLAX/KSLC
A Global Aviation McDonnell Douglas MD-82, registration ZS-TOG performing charter flight QG-112 from Johannesburg (South Africa) to Llilongwe (Malawi) with 120 passengers and 7 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from runway 03L about one minute after takeoff clearance when tower reported there was smoke coming from an engine. The crew rejected takeoff and came to a stop about 2400 meters/7900 feet down the runway indicating they might be able to vacate the runway, tower however instructed the aircraft to hold position on the runway while directing emergency services towards the aircraft.The aircraft left debris behind while slowing and was subsequently seen on the runway with the left wing low and right wing high.The airport confirmed the MD-82 registration ZS-TOG rejected takeoff after a tyre burst, a wheel caught fire. Emergency services responded. All passengers and crew disembarked safely. The runway was closed for 5 hours as result of the occurrence.Ground observers reported the passengers and crew disembarked via the rear tail stair of the aircraft, there had been no fire at all.One ground observer reported he could see the left main gear intact, however, both left main wheel tyres had separated from the wheels, the wheels had been partially ground down causing the aircraft to lean to the left.The US NTSB reported on Dec 14th 2012, that the aircraft experienced a wheel failure on the left hand main gear during acceleration for takeoff from Johannesburg. The pilot rejected takeoff and stopped the aircraft on the runway 03L. The aircraft sustained damage to the left hand main gear, the left hand main wheel assemblies, left hand engine and left hand wing. South Africa's CAA is investigating the incident, the NTSB have appointed an accredited representative to participate in the investigation as representative of the state of manufacture.Global Aviation owns two MD-82s with the registrations ZS-TOG and ZS-GAB.The MD-82 on the runway (Photo: Radioislam):Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):
The German BFU have released their final report in German concluding the probable causes of the serious incident were:direct causes:- the takeoff clearance for the A320 was issued at a time, when the landing of the A380 on the parallel runway had not yet been ensured.- there was no instruction to reject takeoff- a flawed mental approach to resolve the conflict by the air traffic controller lead to the departing aircraft being instructed to turn towards the aircraft arriving and going around on the parallel runway. systemic causes:- the increased coordination between the controllers necessary due to the conditions at their work places as well as due to the organisation of operations of the various runways contributed to the reduction of separation below required minima and approach to the wake- The procedures to disentangle departures on runway 25C and missed approaches on runway 25L provided to air traffic controllers were insufficient.The BFU analysed that due to the low speed of both aircraft and their positions with respect to each other there was no risk of a collision despite the fact, that the minimum separation reduced to 200 feet vertically and 0.97nm horizontally, which was substantially below the required minimum of 1000 feet vertical or 7nm horizontally. However, with the weather conditions present the danger existed, that the A320 would enter the wake of the A380, which could have resulted in uncontrolled movements of the aircraft up to loss of control.The crew of the A380 had decided to go-around when they felt the touchdown within the touch down zone of the runway was no longer assured. The decision to go-around was taken at a point when ground contact could not be avoided, the aircraft touched down before becoming airborne again.The crew of the A320 had no possibility to hear the A380, which communicated on another tower frequency. The A320 began their takeoff run about 15 seconds after receiving takeoff clearance and 12 seconds after the A380 had initiated the go-around. The aircraft accelerated through V1 about 20 seconds later, a rejected takeoff would have been possible until then. It is unlikely however that the A320 crew would have noticed the A380 with the pilot flying focussed on the runway centerline and the pilot monitoring focussed on the instruments. The air traffic controller did not instruct to reject takeoff.The QAR data showed that the A320 did not enter the wake of the A380, however came as close as 30 meters (100 feet) to the wake.At the time of the incident traffic volume at Frankfurt was rather low. Both tower controllers, one responsible for 25L and the other for 25C, had been on duty for a few minutes only at that time. The BFU stated that no audio recording of the tower room was available, the intercommunication between the controllers could therefore not be replayed and was reconstructed from testimonies. The BFU complained that the availability of such a recording could have substantially helped to establish the sequence of events.Upon detecting the go-around the controller responsible for runway 25L should have loudly exclaimed "Missed Approach 25L" to inform his collegues controlling the other runways, however, there was no testimony indicating that such a call did happen. The controller also needed to immediately coordinate with the controller controlling departure runway 18, which would be overflown shortly and terminal area control.The controller intended to turn the A380 to the left rather than had the A380 follow the standard missed approach in order to increase the distance to the departing A320. This mental approach was suitable to resolve the conflict.The controller of runway 25C had observed the A380 until shortly before touchdown and was convinced landing would successfully occur and therefore issued takeoff clearance for the A320 on his runway. It was more than likely that the controller looked at the A320 and thus did not detect that the A380 had initiated a go-around. No further instruction occurred during the takeoff run of the A320, when the A320 climbed through 296 feet AGL the controller issued "... proceed on runway heading, proceed on runway heading, 380 from southern runway has pulled up", the BFU believes by repetition of the instruction he wanted to underline the urgency of the instruction, however, the controller never considered to restrict the climb rate of the flight.When the controller believed the A380 was sufficiently high he wanted to turn his A320 left in order to continue with the standard departure profile and told the south controller "I'll turn mine left". The BFU believes that this mental approach was flawed and was not suitable to resolve the conflict between the two aircraft. In addition, as the A380 was above the A320 turning the A320 left brough the aircraft closer to the wake of the A380. This conflicting instruction was corrected 26 seconds later when the A320 was instructed to turn right. This period of time to correct was too long, the BFU analysed.At the time of the incident there were 5 to 7 octers of cloud ceiling at 2500 feet. This meant that both aircraft were not able to see each other after they had overflown runway 18, and the controllers could not observe the aircraft visually but only on their radar screens. With the winds coming out of southerly directions the wake was blown northwards towards runway 25C.The BFU analysed that the fact, that missed approaches on runway 25L and standard departures on runway 25C crossed, establishes a systemic risk in the form of reduced fault tolerance requiring controllers to compensate by heightened levels of alertness.The BFU analysed further that there had been no procedures developed to resolve a conflict between a go-around on 25L and a departure on 25C. In so far it was left to the controllers to develop a spontaneous procedure to resolve a possible conflict.The BFU analysed that both TCAS systems were monitoring the threatening target, the conditions for issuing traffic or resolution advisories however were not met at any point in time.5 safety recommendations were issued by the investigation including recommendations to develop procedures to separate missed approaches on 25L/07R and departures on 25C/07C and possible control both runways on the same frequency as well as introduce simulator training of abnormal scenarios at the aerodrome requiring controllers to deviate from normal procedures in order to maintain safe operations.Flight trajectories and approach to wake at 13:27:55Z (Graphics: BFU):Flight trajectories and approach to wake at 13:27:27Z (Graphics: BFU):
A Qantas Airbus A380-800, registration VH-OQD performing flight QF-12 from Los Angeles,CA (USA) to Sydney,NS (Australia), was accelerating for takeoff from Los Angeles' runway 24L when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 30 knots), slowed safely and returned to the gate.A passenger reported the crew announced they had received a hydraulic indication which was later identified false.The aircraft departed about 3 hours later and reached Sydney with a delay of 2.5 hours.
An Aeroflot Sukhoi Superjet 100-95, registration RA-89004 performing flight SU-2535 (scheduled dep Dec 8th, actual dep Dec 9th) from Oslo (Norway) to Moscow Sheremetyevo (Russia), was accelerating for takeoff when vibrations developed on one of the engines (SaM146) prompting the crew to reject takeoff and return to the apron. Ice was discovered on the fan blades, which was melted by applying hot air. The aircraft subsequently departed and landed safely at Sheremetyevo Airport's runway 07R about 130 minutes after departure.Rosaviatsia reported the aircraft subsequently underwent maintenance.The aircraft was unable to continue service, the next day's rotation to Oslo was cancelled as a result. The aircraft resumed service in the evening of Dec 11th about 60 hours after landing in Moscow.
An Iberia Airbus A321-200, registration EC-ITN performing flight IB-516 from London Heathrow,EN (UK) to Madrid,SP (Spain), was rotating for takeoff from Heathrow's runway 27R when an engine (CFM56) malfunctioned. The aircraft stopped the climb at 4000 feet, the crew declared emergency and returned to Heathrow for a safe landing on runway 27L about 14 minutes later.The flight was cancelled, the passengers were rebooked onto other flights.
An Enter Air Boeing 737-400, registration SP-ENA performing flight OF-946P from Kiev (Ukraine) to Katowice (Poland), rejected takeoff at high speed (about 110 knots) when the crew smelled strong odour of oil in the cockpit. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.Ukraine's Ministry of Transport reported in their monthly bulletin that the cause of the smell was identified to be oil entering the right hand engine's bleed air system. 
A Dniproavia Embraer ERJ-145 on behalf of Aerosvit, registration UR-DNF performing flight VV-503 from Dnepropetrovsk (Ukraine) to Moscow Vnukovo (Russia), rejected takeoff from Dnepropetrovsk at about 80 knots when the left hand primary flight display went blank. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.Ukraine's Ministry of Transport reported in their monthly bulletin that the causes of the PFD1's extinction are under investigation.
An Aerostar Dornier Do-328 JET, registration UR-WOG performing a charter flight from Prague (Czech Republic) to Lviv (Ukraine), was accelerating for takeoff with the first officer being pilot flying, when the aircraft began to veer right, corrective rudder input did not return the aircraft to the center line. The captain thus decided to reject takeoff, the aircraft came to a stop within the runway edges, the captain taxied the aircraft back to the apron.Ukraine's Ministry of Transport reported in their monthly bulletin, that maintenance found the cables connecting the nose wheel steering to the right hand rudder pedals were crossed. The aircraft had undergone maintenance in Germany between Jul 16th and Sep 5th, the crossed wires had been missed because the aircraft had been flown only from the left hand seat following maintenance until the incident. The investigation commission determined the cause of the rejected takeoff was the rapid deviation from the centerline of the runway due to crossed wires connecting the nose wheel steering to the right hand pedals as result of improper maintenance. Contributing factor was the non-detection of the abnormal controls from the right hand seat. Two safety recommendations were issued to Aerostar to improve preflight preparation in order to detect such control anomalies and to improve acceptance procedures following maintenance.Czech Republic's Aviation Accident Investigation Institute (CAAII) reported in their quarterly bulletin that aircraft rejected takeoff from runway 06 after the aircraft had pulled off the runway centerline. The aircraft subsequently turned around and returned to the apron. 5 days after the incident, on Sep 11th, runway marks were discovered during regular checks indicating there was heavy braking just after intersection with taxiway E and the right main and nose gear had exited the paved surface of the runway to the right. Engineers found a fault in the first officer's directional controls causing the deflection of the nose gear steering opposite to the first officer's rudder pedal input.Tracks found on the runway (Photo: CAAII):
An Orenair Boeing 737-800, registration VP-BPG performing flight R2-9627 from St. Petersburg (Russia) to Sharm el Sheikh (Egypt), rejected takeoff from Pulkovo Airport's runway 28L due to an engine indication.

A PIA Pakistan International Airlines Avion de Transport Regional ATR-42-500, registration AP-BHH performing flight PK-605 from Islamabad to Gilgit (Pakistan) with 48 people on board, rejected takeoff from Islamabad at low speed due to a configuration warning. However, the crew could not move the throttle levers back past the flight idle position, during the subsequent taxi at higher than normal thrust the brakes overheated causing smoke rising from the gear. The aircraft stopped, emergency services responded and cooled the brakes down.The flight was cancelled, the passengers were rebooked onto other flights.The incident aircraft was able to resume service about 3 hours later.
An Egypt Air Boeing 737-800, registration SU-GCZ performing flight MS-706 from Milan Malpensa (Italy) to Cairo (Egypt) with 83 passengers, was accelerating for takeoff with the engines spooling up when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed due to an engine anti ice failure indication. The aircraft returned to the gate to have maintenance rectify the fault.Following maintenance activities the aircraft attempted another departure, upon accelerating the engines for takeoff the crew received the same fault indication again and rejected takeoff at low speed again. The aircraft returned to the apron for maintenance action.Following another attempt to repair the aircraft maintenance signed the aircraft off again and the crew attempted another departure, however the same fault occurred again and the takeoff was rejected at low speed a third time.The third attempt to repair the aircraft finally succeeded, the aircraft departed on the fourth takeoff and reached Cairo with a delay of 5.5 hours.
A United Boeing 737-800, registration N27246 performing flight UA-78 from Hong Kong (China) to Tokyo Narita (Japan), rejected takeoff from Hong Kong's runway 07R and came to a stop about 1250 meters/4100 feet down the runway. Emergency services responded and checked the brakes of the aircraft, the runway was blocked for about 30 minutes until the aircraft taxied back to the apron.The aircraft reached Tokyo with a delay of 2:45 hours.A listener on frequency reported the crew rejected takeoff because of an open door indication.
A UTAir Canadair CRJ-200, registration VQ-BGI performing flight UT-447 from Moscow Vnukovo to Arkhangelsk (Russia), rejected takeoff from Vnukovo Airport due to an open door indication.The rotation was cancelled.
An Expressjet Embraer ERJ-145, registration N15574 performing flight XE-6075 from Chicago O'Hare,IL to Buffalo,NY (USA), was cleared for takeoff from O'Hare's runway 32L.At the same time a Skywest Canadair CRJ-200, registration N905SW performing flight OO-6958 from Muskegon,MI to Chicago O'Hare,IL (USA), was cleared to land on runway 09R, the final approach track crossing runway 32L.The NTSB reported, that a supervisor on duty noticed the developing conflict, in which the Skywest would almost overfly the Expressjet, and instructed the controller handling the Skywest to direct the aircraft to go around. The Skywest crew went around as instructed and overflew the Expressjet, the separation reduced to 225 feet vertical and less than 480 feet lateral.The Expressjet continued the takeoff and climbed out normally reaching their destination safely, the Skywest landed safely following their second approach.The NTSB have opened an investigation into the "air traffic control incident".On Sep 15th 2012 the NTSB released their brief factual report adding that the two aircraft carried a total of 63 people.The third local controller (3LC) had cleared XE-6075 to line up runway 32L and wait, 44 seconds later he cleared the aircraft for takeoff with the additional remark "don't delay roll". 56 seconds the controller transmitted an expletive, the north local controller (NLC) who had cleared OO-6958 to land on runway 09R prior to 3LC clearing XE-6075 to line up runway 32, instructed OO-6958 to go around 1 second after the expletive.12 seconds after 3LC had transmitted his expletive, the crew of XE-6075 transmitted their expletive too and inquired "what was that?" After issuing instructions to turn right and remain on frequency and upon a second query "what was that" 3LC transmitted "sorry about that".The ATC supervisor relieved 3LC after that transmission and logged the occurrence.FAA radar data showed OO-6958 crossed runway 32L about 275 feet above and 480 feet behind XE-6075.On Nov 8th 2012 the NTSB released their final report concluding the probable cause was:The air traffic controllers failure to adhere to runway separation requirements and his issuance of an improper takeoff clearance. Contributing to the incident was the controller's failure to recall that there was an arrival inbound to a crossing runway.Aerodrome Chart (Graphics: FAA):
An Aserca Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-82, flight R7-757 from Caracas to Maracaibo (Venezuela), suffered a bird strike upon rotation for takeoff prompting the crew to stop the climb at safe altitude and return to Caracas for a safe landing.A passenger reported that a bang was heard just when nose lifted for takeoff, the captain subsequently announced that a number of sensors had been disabled by a bird strike requiring them to return to Caracas.The aircraft was able to depart again and was on final approach to Maracaibo when the weather prevented a safe landing prompting the crew to return to Caracas again. Following a third departure the aircraft finally reached Maracaibo with a delay of 12 hours the following morning.The airline confirmed the aircraft returned to Caracas as a precaution following a bird strike upon first takeoff. After examination of the aircraft the aircraft flew to Maracaibo but could not land due to gusting strong cross winds and a thunderstorm over the aerodrome and returned to Caracas. 
A Ural Airlines Airbus A320-200, registration VP-BQZ performing flight U6-2926 from Khudzhand (Tajikistan) to Ufa (Russia), rejected takeoff from Khudzhand due to the failure of the left hand engine (CFM56) and returned to the apron.
A Dniproavia Embraer ERJ-145 on behalf of Aerosvit, registration UR-DNG performing flight VV-205 from Kiev (Ukraine) to Sofia (Bulgaria), rejected takeoff from Kiev at high speed (107 KIAS) when the Multi Function Display #2 (MFD2) faded away. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.Ukraine's Ministry of Transport reported in their monthly bulletin that the commander's decision to reject takeoff was in compliance with the manuals. Maintenance however was unable to replicate the failure and was unable to determine a reason. Upon recommendation by the aircraft manufacturer the MFD2 was replaced. The manufacturer stated that the display tends to develop massive failures after 10,000 hours of operating time, although the maintenance manual stated 10,600 hours. The investigation commission determined the failure of the MFD2 was the result of internal instability following long lifetime that exceeded the average use of MFDs.
A Dniproavia Boeing 737-500 on behalf of Aerosvit, registration UR-DND performing flight VV-18 from Odessa to Kiev (Ukraine), was about to takeoff from Odessa when after applying takeoff thrust the takeoff configuration alert sounded prompting the crew to reject takeoff. The aircraft returned to the apron.Ukraine's Ministry of Transport reported in their monthly bulletin that maintenance found a failed switch signalling the speedbrakes were in the proper position for takeoff. The switch was replaced.
An Aerosvit Boeing 737-300, registration UR-VVA performing flight VV-452 from Moscow Sheremetyevo (Russia) to Kiev (Ukraine), was accelerating for takeoff from Sheremetyevo's runway 25L.An Aeroflot Airbus A321-200, registration VP-BDC performing flight SU-1473 from Nizhnevartovsk to Moscow Sheremetyevo (Russia), was on final approach to runway 25R descending through about 1600 feet MSL when the crew decided to go around due to being above approach profile (unstabilized approach).In reaction to the go-around tower instructed UR-VVA to stop, the crew rejected takeoff at low speed (107 kph/57 KIAS).UR-VVA was able to depart again about 5 hours later and reached Kiev with a delay of 5 hours.Aerosvit said the aircraft underwent careful examination following the rejected takeoff.
A UTAir Boeing 737-500, registration VQ-BJQ performing flight UT-245 from Moscow Domodedovo to Surgut (Russia), rejected takeoff from Domodedovo Airport at high speed (80 KIAS) due to an overtemperature of the left hand engine (CFM56). The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.
An Air Canada Boeing 777-300, registration C-FIVR performing flight AC-7 from Vancouver,BC (Canada) to Hong Kong (China) with 368 people on board, was just rotating for takeoff from Vancouver's runway 08R when the crew observed a heron and believed it had struck the aircraft. There were no abnormal indications, the crew therefore decided to continue the flight. During the climb cabin crew however reported intermittent burning odour in the cabin. The crew thus reported smoke in the cockpit, dumped fuel and returned to Vancouver for a safe landing on runway 08R about one hour after departure.The Canadian TSB reported 40 tons of fuel were dumped, the aircraft landed safely, brakes temperatures remained normal and the aircraft taxied to gate. Maintenance found significant damage to the right hand engine's (GE90) acoustic tiles, that is being assessed by powerplant engineering. Feathers were recovered from the engine and have been forwarded for identification.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/ACA7/history/20121017/2050Z/CYVR/VHHH
A Norwegian Air Shuttle Boeing 737-800, flight DY-742 from Oslo to Trondheim (Norway) with 184 passengers, was accelerating for takeoff when the aircraft started to skid. The crew rejected takeoff, the aircraft came to a safe stop however smoke was observed in the cabin. No injuries occurred.Oslo Airport reported that what was thought to be smoke was identified as steam. The runway was very slippery causing difficulty during takeoff, the aircraft however remained within the boundaries of the runway.The airline said takeoff was rejected because of the aircraft beginning to skid. The brakes got very hot resulting in some smoke, the aircraft stopped on the runway.A replacement Boeing 737-800 registration LN-NGD reached Trondheim with a delay of 2.5 hours.Metars:ENGM 190812Z 20009KT CAVOK 08/06 Q1009 NOSIGENGM 190741Z 20007KT CAVOK 07/06 Q1009 NOSIGENGM 190711Z 21004KT 9999 FEW010 BKN220 07/06 Q1008 NOSIG ENGM 190641Z 21005KT CAVOK 07/06 Q1008 NOSIGENGM 190611Z 22005KT 190V250 CAVOK 07/06 Q1007 NOSIGENGM 190541Z 21008KT 9999 FEW010 BKN015 08/06 Q1007 NOSIG ENGM 190511Z 21009KT 9999 FEW009 BKN011 08/07 Q1007 NOSIG ENGM 190447Z 21011KT 9999 BKN011 08/07 Q1006ENGM 190412Z 21009KT 9999 FEW010 BKN012 08/07 Q1006 NOSIG ENGM 190340Z 20011KT 9999 FEW010 BKN012 08/07 Q1006 NOSIG ENGM 190315Z 21008KT 9999 FEW010 BKN012 08/07 Q1006 
An Air Baltic Boeing 737-300, registration YL-BBY performing flight BT-352 from Vilnius (Lithunia) to Riga (Latvia), rejected takeoff from Vilnius at low speed after the aircraft veered to the right, the aircraft stopped on the runway. Attempts by the crew to steer the aircraft to the left in order to return to the runway center line failed. The aircraft was shut down and towed to the apron.The flight was cancelled.The incident aircraft was able to position to Riga as flight BT-9802 about 2 hours later.A passenger reported the aircraft had lined up and was starting its takeoff run when the aircraft veered to the right and takeoff was rejected. After the crew tried to turn the aircraft left to get back onto the runway center line the aircraft was shut down and subsequently towed to the apron. The flight was cancelled.
A Swiss Avro RJ-100, registration HB-IXP performing flight LX-1189 from Nuremberg (Germany) to Zurich (Switzerland), rejected takeoff from Nuremberg at high speed due to abnormal engine readings.

A Gojet Canadair CRJ-700 on behalf of United, registration N171GJ performing flight G7-3654/UA-3654 from Grand Rapids,MI to Denver,CO (USA) with about 70 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from runway 17 when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed reporting smoke in the cabin. The aircraft came to a stop near the intersection with runway 26L about 3300 feet/1000 meters down the runway and was evacuated. Emergency services responded.All runways were temporarily closed to facilitate the emergency, runway 26R was opened about 10 minutes later but due to weight restrictions and limited length could not be used for some arrivals and departures.Passengers reported that smoke began to appear from the back of the cabin when the engines accelerated for takeoff, people started to shout, about half way down the runway the takeoff was rejected. Flight attendants began to evacuate the aircraft to the left.Air Traffic Control told other aircraft operating into and out of Grand Rapids that the aircraft had rejected takeoff, both cockpit and cabin had been full of smoke and the occupants had evacuated, it would last at least half an hour to one hour to get one of the main runways 17 or 26L open again, new clearances could be expected in about 55 minutes prompting a number of aircraft to divert.About 45 minutes after the rejected takeoff, after all passengers had been collected and bussed to the terminal, main runway 26L was re-opened permitting the airport to resume normal operation.
A British Airways Boeing 737-400, registration G-DOCO performing flight BA-2676 from London Gatwick,EN (UK) to Paphos (Cyprus), rejected takeoff from London Gatwick at low speed and returned to the gate.Following maintenance the aircraft was able to depart about 35 minutes later and reached Paphos with a delay of 20 minutes.A passenger reported the crew announced a "switch problem" had prompted them to reject takeoff.

An Air Bridge Cargo Boeing 747-8 freighter, registration VQ-BLR performing flight RU-198 from Shanghai Pudong (China) to Moscow Domodedovo (Russia) with 2 crew, rejected takeoff from Shanghai's Pudong Airport after one of the left hand engines (GEnx-2B67) failed at around 11:20L (03:20Z). The aircraft slowed safely. A subsequent runway inspection revealed a lot of metallic debris on the runway along a distance of 2500 meters/8200 feet.The runway was closed until 15:00L until all debris was collected and the runway had been sweeped.Russia's Rosaviatsia (Civil Aviation Authority) reported the crew received a fan speed reduction indication of the outboard left hand engine #1 with the aircraft showing a tendency to turn left, rejected takeoff at about 50 knots (low speed) and returned to the apron. A subsequent inspection revealed turbine blades had been destroyed (contained engine failure). The engine is going to be replaced and sent for investigation to detect the reasons of internal destruction.The NTSB issued two urgent safety recommendations to the FAA to - require ultrasonic scans before any prior use of GEnx engines for midshaft fractures- require repetitive on-wing inspections of the engine at sufficiently short intervals in order to be able to detect cracks before it could reach a critical length.The NTSB reported that during the takeoff run of VQ-BLR while accelerating through 50 knots the crew observed a reduction in the N1 speed indication of the #1 engine. The aircraft returned to the ramp where an inspection revealed extensive damage to the low pressure turbine. Photos of that damage are similiar to an earlier engine failure in Charleston,SC (USA), where during a pre-first flight low speed taxi test the #2 engine's N1 indication rolled back after the low pressure turbine shaft shifted aft resulting in extensive damage to low pressure turbine blades and vanes. Further examination subsequently revealed the forward end of the fan midshaft had separated at the rear of threads. That engine had not been used in flight, it had only been run in post production tests and post installation ground runs in Charleston. A similiar crack had been detected on another engine during examinations as result of the engine failure in Charleston.On Sep 21st 2012 the FAA released Airworthiness Directive 2012-19-08 putting the NTSB recommendations into effect and defining the repetitive inspection interval at 90 days.

An Alitalia Airbus A320-200, registration EI-DTJ performing flight AZ-1344 from Bologna to Catania (Italy) with 91 passengers and 6 crew, was cleared for takeoff from Bologna's runway 30, the airport was operating according to low visibility requirements. The aircraft rotated and climbed out, upon contacting departure the crew complained "Ehh, there was a Panda at the left edge of the runway" (identifying a vehicle rather than an animal).Italy's ANSV released their final report concluding the probable cause of the serious incident was:an untimely handover from one tower controller to the next during which key information about two vehicles cleared onto the runway was omitted.The ANSV reported tower had cleared two vehicles, one for bird control and another one for a runway inspection (called "Safety"), onto the runway, the airport was operating according to low visibility procedures. These inspections were taken at regular intervals, the vehicles had been cleared onto and withdrawn from the runway several times within 30 minutes prior to the occurrence. In the meantime AZ-1344 obtained start up and push back clearance. About two minutes after AZ-1344 received push back clearance (on ground frequency) tower cleared the two vehicles back onto the runway, the runway inspection car entered the runway at taxiway A (at the threshold of runway 12 tracking towards the threshold of runway 30), the bird control vehicle entered the runway via taxiway H (at the displaced threshold runway 30). The tower controller however did not activate the runway occupied indication.Ground subsequently cleared AZ-1344 to taxi to the holding point K2 at the beginning of runway 30. Tower controller advised the two vehicles of the aircraft taxiing on taxiway T. As runway occupation and all runway clearances depended solely on him, the tower controller still did not activate the runway occupied indication, but placed the flight strip of AZ-1344 onto his stack of active flights on his multifunction displays.In the next minute the next tower controller, arriving late for his shift, showed up for duties. The outgoing controller briefed the incoming controller on Ei-DTJ taxiing on taxiway T but forgot to mention the presence of two vehicles on the runway. The handover was carried out very quickly in the belief nothing important had to be conveyed. The incoming controller did a brief scan of the situation but was mainly attracted by EI-DTJ taxiing towards holding point K2.About one minute after the hand over ground handed EI-DTJ off to tower. When the aircraft reported on tower frequency, the incoming controller made his first actual transmission "Alitalia 1344, good afternoon, runway t(h)ree zero, line up and cleared for takeoff, wind calm."About 75 seconds after that transmission EI-DTJ had lined up and began the takeoff run, the two vehicles had reached about mid point of the runway each and were near the exit onto a service road.The outgoing controller, who was still in the back of the control room, made an impassioned call to his collegue that the runway was occupied.The first who reacted was the ground controller who grabbed the tower microphone and called "Safety immediately vacate to Alpha" prompting the driver of the bird control vehicle to speed off the runway via the service road and report his callsign was "bird control" while the safety car did not report. The ground controller, who had not been involved with the operation of the two vehicles and did not fully understand the situaiton, did not see another less prominent target on the ground radar screen, which was shown on the runway for the safety vehicle which was moving between intersections with taxiways E and F. The driver of the safety vehicle, still driving towards the threshold of runway 30 in opposite direction, however noticed lights moving ahead and sped off to the right beyond the edge of the runway onto the shoulder and stopped about 8 seconds later, the aircraft at that point was 287 meters from the vehicle and passed the vehicle about 4 seconds later at a speed of about 120 knots, the horizontal distance between the tip of the left wing and the vehicle reduced to 10 meters.After the aircraft rotated and contacted departure the crew compained "Ehh, there was a Panda at the left edge of the runway".The investigation released two safety recommendations arguing that even if the controller is operating entirely alone this does not absolve him from operating the runway occupation indications as required by procedures in order to ensure, that a sudden replacement can immediately recognize the present scenario.Metar:LIPE 201250Z 35003KT 320V040 1200 R12/1800VP2000D BR BKN002 02/02 Q1025 RMK VIS MIN 1200=Map (Graphics: ANSV):
Japan's Transportation Safety Board (JTSB) released their final report in Japanese concluding the probable cause of the serious incident was:During takeoff the right hand engine's #4 bearing scavenge system ruptured, the first diffuser tube of the #4 bearing scavenge system released engine oil through the opening. The released engine oil came in contact with the engine's hot section and ignited.The fracture of the #4 bearing scavenge tube was the result of fatigue produced by stress created by vibrations by the operation of the engine.The captain (52, ATPL, 14,720 hours total, 1,405 hours on type) was pilot monitoring, the first officer (41, CPL, 6,574 hours total, 3,949 hours on type) was pilot flying. The aircraft accelerated for takeoff on runway 27 and rotated at about 160 KIAS. Shortly after becoming airborne Sendai tower reported white smoke coming from the right hand engine, however received no reply. Sendai departure transmitted the tower's observation of white smoke near the right hand engine about 40 seconds after the tower reported the observation. The crew engaged the autopilot about 20 seconds after that transmission. 118 seconds after becoming airborne while climbing through 5500 feet the crew received a right hand engine fire indication, throttled both engine back and declared emergency. The aircraft stopped the climb at 6150 feet and began to gradually descend. 90 seconds after the fire alert the crew shut the right hand engine down and discharged the first fire bottle, 80 seconds later discharged the second fire bottle after which the fire indication ceased. The aircraft joined a left downwind and landed safely on Sendai's runway 27 about 15 minutes after becoming airborne.The captain reported in post flight interviews that engine start and taxi towards the runway was normal with no anomaly observed. After steering the aircraft onto runway 27 the first officer assumed control and began takeoff, which felt smooth without any anomaly. After rotation and positive rate of the climb the captain selected the gear up and contacted departure and was told "radar contact". When the aircraft climbed through about 3000 feet departure informed the crew about white smoke from the right hand engine during takeoff. The captain checked the engine instruments and noticed an amber warning light indicating low oil pressure, the master caution had not been activated. The captain decided to activate the procedures for the low oil pressure indication and was about to order level off at 6000 feet when the right hand engine's fire warning activated. The captain sensed a slight yaw to the right and suspecting the right hand engine had been damaged assumed control of the aircraft with the first officer assuming the role of pilot monitoring, the fire memory checklists were actioned shutting the engine down and discharging the first fire bottle and starting the timer. After 80 seconds, when the fire indication had not ceased, the second fire bottle was discharged which resulting in the fire warning extinguishing. The aircraft subsequently joined a downwind to position for landing on runway 27 and stopped on the runway to have emergency services check the aircraft. Emergency services reported no smoke, the crew therefore taxied the aircraft to the apron.The tower control said in post incident interviews that he had cleared the aircraft for takeoff from runway 27 and contact departure upon airborne. When the aircraft began to accelerate there was nothing unusual, by the time the aircraft began to rotate white smoke became visible from the right hand engine. He reported his observation, the crew however had already switched to departure. He then forwarded his observation to the departure controller who relayed the information, the aircraft subsequently stopped the climb at 6000 feet. The departure controller indicated that the crew had declared emergency due to an engine fire.A post flight inspection of the aircraft revealed no damage to the aircraft, the right hand engine however showed decolouration to the cowling, the pressure relief door had opened with traces of heat loss extending backwards of the door. The diffuser case was broken and traces of oil leakage were found. Right hand engine after landing (Photo: JTSB):The fractured scavenge tube (Photo: JTSB):
An American Airlines Boeing 757-200, registration N191AN performing flight AA-980 from Miami,FL (USA) to Salvador,BA (Brazil), was instructed to line up and wait on runway 27 and was advised traffic would be landing on (crossing) runway 30, the controller subsequently cleared AA-980 for takeoff from runway 27.An American Eagle Embraer ERJ-145, registration N623AE performing flight MQ-3455 from Tallahassee,FL to Miami,FL (USA), was on final approach to Miami's runway 30 and was cleared to land on runway 30.About 77 seconds after the controller had issued the takeoff clearance to AA-980, the controller cancelled the takeoff clearance and instructed MQ-3455 to go around in the same transmission. AA-980 rejected takeoff, MQ-3455 went around. MQ-3455 positioned for another approach and landed safely, AA-980 vacated runway 27 via taxiway T5 (the first exit to the right, a high speed turnoff for runway 09) and had the brakes checked before departing again about 20 minutes later. Both aircraft reached their destinations safely.The NTSB reported that 77 seconds after issuing the takeoff clearance for AA-980 the controller cancelled the takeoff clearance and issued a go-around instruction to MQ-3455 just at the same time as the Airport Surface Detection Equipment issued an alert. AA-980 was just passing through the intersection runway 27/runway 30 when MQ-3455 overflew the intersection, the vertical separation reduced to approximately 160 feet. The NTSB is investigating.Map (Graphics: Google Earth):
A Chautauqua Embraer ERJ-145 on behalf of Delta Airlines, registration N566RP performing flight RP-6087/DL-6087 from Richmond,VA to New York La Guardia,NY (USA), rejected takeoff from Richmond's runway 34 when a windshield cracked. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The flight was cancelled, the passengers were rebooked onto later flights.The airport reported the aircraft was accelerating for takeoff when a crack in the windshield was discovered. The crew rejected takeoff safely.
An Astra Airlines Greece British Aerospace BAe-146-300, registration SX-DIZ performing flight AZI-128 from Kharkov (Ukraine) to Thessaloniki (Greece), rejected takeoff from Kharkov after one of the left hand engines (ALF502) failed. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.Ukraine's Ministry of Transport did not report further details in their monthly bulletin.
A Dniproavia Embraer ERJ-145 on behalf of Aerosvit, registration UR-DNR performing flight VV-6 from Dnepropetrovsk to Kiev (Ukraine), was accelerating for takeoff when the crew received a nose gear indication and rejected takeoff. The aircraft returned to the apron.Ukraine's Ministry of Transport reported in their monthly bulletin that subsequent examination of the aircraft found no fault with the nose gear assembly. However given the state of the aerodrome the commission considered the likely cause of the occurrence being the runway condition featuring slabs designed for air force and civil aircraft operation with larger wheels featuring large gaps to permit slab extension during high summer temperatures. However, the commission said, the runway surface needs to be designed for safe operation of modern aircraft with smaller wheels as well and such should use plates of more rigid design addressing the issues of gaps and height differences.
A Dniproavia Embraer ERJ-145 on behalf of Aerosvit, registration UR-DNF performing flight VV-53 from Kiev to Ivano-Frankovsk (Ukraine), was accelerating the engines for takeoff from Kiev when the crew received a park brake and takeoff configuration alert, rejected takeoff and returned to the apron.A subsequent test of the takeoff configuration alert revealed that the takeoff configuration was not sensed correctly with the park brakes seen set although not set. The commander taxied the aircraft briefly activating and releasing the brakes and repeated the test, however again received the alert regarding brakes.Ukraine's Ministry of Transport reported in their monthly bulletin that the examination subsequently found oxidation at a pressure sensor which led to the contacts remaining closed signalling incorrect brake configuration for takeoff.
A UTAir Avion de Transport Regional ATR-42-300, flight UT-261 from Tyumen to Nizhnevartosk (Russia) with 43 passengers and 3 crew, rejected takeoff from Tyumen due to the failure of the left hand engine. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.Ural's Transport Investigative Committee is investigating the occurrence.
A Helvetic Airlines Fokker 100 on behalf of Swiss, registration HB-JVF performing flight LX-1884 from Zurich (Switzerland) to Bucharest Otopeni (Romania), was spooling engines up for takeoff from runway 28 when the crew observed an unusual EGT indication for the left hand engine (MK650) and rejected takeoff. The aircraft returned to the apron vacating the runway via taxiway K (first available exit 550 meters down the runway).A replacement Swiss Airbus A320-200 registration HB-IJD departed Zurich about 2.5 hours later and reached Bucharest with a delay of 2:15 hours.
The Australian Transportation Safety Board released their final report reporting that Taree was not controlled at the time of the incident. A Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF) was in use.The private aircraft had broadcast its intention to takeoff from runway 22 prior to entering the runway and heard no other traffic on the frequency. After completing the pre-takeoff preparations the pilot announced "rolling runway 22 Taree" on CTAF and commenced takeoff.When the aircraft accelerated through about 50 knots the passenger seated in the front seat pointed an aircraft out that was approaching the runway holding point. The pilot expected the aircraft to stop at the holding point and given they were nearly airborne continued takeoff. Still no CTAF broadcasts were heard in the cockpit.Just when the aircraft accelerated through 65 knots and became airborne about 1/4 to 1/3 down the runway the pilot observed the other aircraft move past the hold short line and turn right onto runway 04. The pilot assessed it was the safest option to continue the takeoff and estimated they were passing directly over the other aircraft at about 300 feet.A Regional Express Saab 340 registration VH-ZLH was departing Taree for Grafton and was taxiing towards runway 04. The first officer made a CTAF broadcast announcing their intentions to depart runway 04 and received response from ground personnel in line with company standard procedures. Not hearing any other traffic on CTAF the crew entered runway 04, when the captain noticed a shadow moving along his left, then both flight crew saw an aircraft climbing straight over them. Neither crew had seen the aircraft prior to that, both stated in post incident testimonies.Following the incident both aircraft were able to talk to each other on CTAF.The ATSB reported that the CTAF transmissions were not recorded, a neighbouring Port Macquaries CTAF, on the same/common frequency, was recorded and contained a number, but not all transmissions relevant to the incident. The recordings permitted to conclude that both aircrafts' radios were operating, however due to the limited number of transmissions recorded did not permit to take further conclusions. The ATSB commented that it did not become clear why the two aircraft did not hear the reported transmissions of each other.As result of the investigation the ATSB released the following:SAFETY MESSAGEWhen operating outside controlled airspace, it is the pilots responsibility to maintain separation with other aircraft both in the air and on the ground. For this, it is important that pilots utilise both alerted and un-alerted see-and-avoid principles.In alerted see-and-avoid in uncontrolled airspace, a pilot is assisted in sighting conflicting traffic by broadcasts from other aircraft. Un-alerted see-and-avoid relies entirely on the ability of the pilot to sight other aircraft.The physical limitations of the human eye are such that even the most careful visual search may not guarantee that traffic will be sighted due to:a. a significant proportion of the view being masked by the blind spot in the eye, or b. the eyes focusing at an inappropriate distance due to the effect of obstructions or to empty field myopia7.The contrast between an aircraft and its background can be significantly reduced by atmospheric effects, even in conditions of good visibility.An on-board collision avoidance system can provide a significant safety benefit outside controlled airspace and at uncontrolled aerodromes. TCAS should not be reserved for use airborne as the safety benefit on the ground could also pay dividends. The use of all available means to increase the visibility of an aircraft should also be made  the use of wig-wags included.Pilots should never assume that not hearing other CTAF broadcasts means an absence of CTAF traffic. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) have published a number of Civil Aviation Advisory Publications (CAAPs) dealing with operations at non-towered aerodromes and the importance of not relying solely on radio broadcasts for traffic advice.
A Naft Air Fokker 100, registration EP-MIS performing flight NV-2564 from Isfahan to Tehran Mehrabad (Iran), rejected takeoff from Isfahan at low speed. The aircraft returned to the apron, where the passengers disembarked.The aircraft was able to depart again and reached Tehran with a delay of 1:40 hours.A passenger reported the aircraft, that had arrived from Sirri Island as flight 2564 for the scheduled intermediate stop at Isfahan and was going to continue to Tehran, was accelerating for takeoff from Isfahan when an engine suddenly shut down prompting the crew to reject takeoff. After about 20 minutes the aircraft returned to the apron, passengers were asked to disembark. A number of passengers decided not to embark the aircraft again, that reached Tehran with about 90-100 minutes delay.
The Dutch Onderzoeksraad (Dutch Safety Board DSB) is investigating in a so called "short term study" how it was possible that tower cleared a number of flights for takeoff from closed runway 18L, also known as Aalsmeerbaan, between about 20:20L and about 20:40L.The Dutch Safety Board reported on Jun 21st 2012 that the runway had been closed at 17:30L (15:30Z) and was under control by the Airport Authority with the possibility of trucks crossing the runway. The runway had not yet been released by the Airport Authority to Air Traffic Control when tower cleared flights for takeoff from the runway for a period of about 20 minutes starting at about 20:20L (18:20Z). The closure of the runway was not indicated in the NOTAMs.Netherland's Luchtverkeersleiding (LVNL), the ATC service provider in the Netherlands, reported all 9 flights departed without incident in clear weather and on a clearly visible runway. The tower controller had full view of the runway and could have intervened in case of obstacles on or approaching the runway, however, no other traffic or obstacles were on or near the runway during those 20 minutes. The LVNL said that other airport work related traffic could have entered the runway without clearance as the runway was closed for air traffic. The error was detected when the airport authority actually returned the runway to ATC, all relevant authorities including the DSB were immediately informed. In addition the LVNL have opened an internal investigation.Radar data show the last departure from runway 18L before closure was at 15:29Z, the next departures were (list most probably incomplete): at 18:11Z (C25B), 18:29Z (B737, KL-1369), 18:37Z (F70, KL-1512), 18:39Z (B737, KL-1659), 18:41Z (A318, AF-1357), 18:44Z (A319, AZ-117), 18:45Z (B738, KL-1681) and 18:49Z (B738, AT-853).
A Mahan Air Boeing 747-300, registration EP-MND performing a Hajj flight from Tehran Mehrabad (Iran) to Jeddah (Saudi Arabia), rejected takeoff from Mehrabad Airport at high speed after engine #4 (CF6, outboard right) failed. The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway when 11 main gear tyres deflated due to hot brakes disabling the aircraft on the taxiway.Brakes, tyres and engine #4 needed to be replaced.
A Nolinor Aviation Boeing 737-200, registration C-GNLN performing flight NLR-940 from Rouyn,QC to Donaldson,QC (Canada) with 4 people on board, rejected takeoff from Rouyn when the crew detected problems with the left hand engine. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The Canadian TSB reported the engine suffered abnormalities similiar to a compressor stall. Maintenance replaced the pressure ratio bleed control valve.
An Air Canada Airbus A319-100, registration C-GAQZ performing flight AC-425 from Montreal,QC to Toronto,ON (Canada) with 113 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from Montreal's runway 06R when the crew rejected the takeoff due to a right hand engine (CFM56) indication. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The Canadian TSB reported maintenance discovered a right hand engine's "inboard variable stator vane (VSV) actuator rod end bushing was binding the VSV linkage". The actuator was replaced, leak and function checks carried out and engine #2 ground run before the aircraft was returned to service.
A Vietnam Airlines Airbus A321-200, registration VN-A356 performing flight VN-1552 from Nha Trang to Hanoi (Vietnam) with 184 passengers and 7 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Nha Trang in light rain and visibility of about 3000 meters/1.8 mi when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed after the right hand engine (V2533) failed. The aircraft slowed safely and stopped on the runway for checks before the aircraft returned to the apron.The passengers were taken to Hanoi with the next flight 4 hours later.The cause of the engine failure is under investigation.The French BEA reported the crew received a right hand engine fire indication during takeoff. Vietnam's Authorities are investigating.
An Eva Air Airbus A330-200, registration B-16302 performing flight BR-2197 from Tokyo Narita (Japan) to Taipei (Taiwan) with 192 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from runway 16R when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed and stopped on the runway. The aircraft was towed to the apron, the runway was closed for 48 minutes.The aircraft was able to depart again about 2 hours later and reached Taipei with a delay of 1:45 hours.Japan's Ministry of Transport reported the crew received a low tyre pressure indication which was determined false.
An Aerosvit Airlines Antonov AN-148-100 on behalf of Ukraine International Airlines, registration UR-NTA performing flight PS-27 from Kiev to Kharkov (Ukraine), was accelerating for takeoff when the right hand engine accelerated to emergency maximum takeoff thrust. The crew rejected takeoff and safely returned to the apron.Ukraine's Ministry of Transport reported in their monthly bulletin that a false signal had indicated the loss of thrust from the left hand engine as result of a systemic issue occurring with the AC electrical generator being activated prior to engine start.
A Rutaca Boeing 737-200, flight RUC-1342 from Caracas to Ciudad Bolivar (Venezuela), rejected takeoff from Caracas due to a hydraulic failure. The aircraft slowed safely and was disabled on the runway. The aircraft was towed to the apron.Runway 10/28 was closed for about 90 minutes as a result.
A Mauritania International Airlines Boeing 737-500, registration 5T-CLA performing flight L6-101 from Bamako (Mali) to Nouakchott (Mauritania), rejected takeoff from Bamako at high speed as result of losing engine power. The aircraft came to a stop past the end of the runway still on the paved surface of the runway end safety area at about 19:00L (19:00Z). No injuries and no damage occurred.Instead of requesting the aircraft to be towed to the apron the crew attempted to turn the aircraft around on its own power resulting in the aircraft exiting paved surface. The aircraft needed to be shut down and remained on the ground for about 25 hours as a result, until engine repairs had been completed and inspections confirmed no additional damage to the aircraft as result of the overrun.Mali's accident investigation board is investigating, the black boxes have been removed from the aircraft.
A KLM Airbus A330-200, registration PH-AOC performing flight KL-546 from Khartoum (Sudan) to Amsterdam (Netherlands) with 247 people on board, rejected takeoff from Khartoum at low speed. The crew reported brakes problems after stopping for a while and returned to the apron.The aircraft was able to depart with a delay of 2:15 hours and reached Amsterdam with a delay of 1:45 hours.
An Onur Air Airbus A321-200, flight 8Q-88 from Istanbul Ataturk to Trabzon (Turkey), rejected takeoff at high speed after the right hand engine ingested a bird. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.A replacement Airbus A321-200 registration TC-OAN reached Trabzon with a delay of 2.5 hours.
An Egypt Air Airbus A321-200, registration SU-GBU performing flight MS-724 from Aleppo (Syria) to Cairo (Egypt) with 130 passengers, contacted the runway surface with its tail while rotating for takeoff from Aleppo at around 05:10L (02:10Z), the crew continued the climb to FL310. When the aircraft was enroute at FL310 about 85nm east of Larnaca (Cyprus) the crew decided to divert to Larnaca where the aircraft landed safely about 50 minutes after departure from Aleppo. The aircraft received substantial damage.The remainder of the flight was cancelled.The scheduled rotation Cairo-Larnaca-Cairo flights MS-741/MS-742 was upgraded from a scheduled Boeing 737-500 to an Airbus A330-200 registration SU-GCK delivering the passengers of MS-724 to Cairo with a delay of 13.5 hours.Metars Aleppo:OSAP 060400Z 26005KT CAVOK 15/10 Q1011 OSAP 060300Z 26003KT CAVOK 13/09 Q1011 OSAP 060200Z VRB03KT CAVOK 13/10 Q1011 OSAP 060100Z 29003KT CAVOK 13/11 Q1010 OSAP 060000Z VRB03KT CAVOK 14/11 Q1011 
The German BFU released their final report in German concluding the probable causes of the serious incident were:too high a speed during line up with the snow covered runway.Contributing factors were:- the "rolling takeoff" was not conducted in accordance with the operating manual of the airline- the procedure "static run-up" was not executed although required in the existing weather conditions- the continuous heavy snow fall resulted in a snow cover on the runway despite continuous snow clearing activity- the published procedures for "adverse weather" and "initiating takeoff roll" were not executed according to operator's operations manual and flight crew operating manual.The BFU reported the aircraft departed with a delay of about one hour. Following de-icing procedures the crew reported ready for departure, ground control reported "braking action on runway medium, contact tower". The aircraft was subsequently instructed by tower to "hold short, I'll call you". Some time later the controller queried "ready for rolling", the crew replied "affirm" and was cleared to line up runway 10. About 13 seconds after that instruction the aircraft was cleared for takeoff with the note "company traffic is 6 miles". The aircraft taxied onto the runway with a speed of 21 knots above ground, during the turn onto the runway both main gear came to the left of the runway center line, the crew turned further right to get back onto the runway center line but were unable to steer the aircraft left subsequently.The flight data recorder showed that during line up, at a heading of about 020 degrees (runway heading 099 degrees) both power levers were increased from about 36 to 46 degrees resulting in the engines accelerating from 21% N1 to 43% N1, the left engine reached 43% N1 when the aircraft turned through 073 degrees at a ground speed of 12 knots. In the next 12 seconds the aircraft accelerated to 19 knots, the aircraft continued to turn right until 112 degrees, the turn continued until reaching 120 degrees at 17 knots ground speed. At that point the power levers were retarded, the engines reduced to 21% N1 and the aircraft stopped within 6 seconds, however not without leaving the right runway edge at a ground speed of 17 knots. About 15 meters after exiting the runway the aircraft stopped with the left main gear on the runway, nose and right main gear off the paved surface about 5 meters off the runway edge at a heading of 107 degrees.The captain (50, ATPL) had a total experience of 5,291 hours and 3,720 hours on type, the first officer (39, CPL) had a total experience of 4,603 hours and 1,738 hours on type.At the time of the serious incident the runway was covered with wet snow of 2 millimeters (0.08 inches), the braking action was medium.The BFU analysed that the thrust was increased too early when the aircraft turned through heading 020. With the existing runway conditions - a snow cover was visible throughout the runway - the crew must have anticipated that the gear would skid. The large angle to the runway center line, the high speed and the power increase caused the aircraft to skid with both main gear beyond the runway centerline, the crew attempted to compensate by increased deflection of nose wheel steering, however due to the slippery runway surface, increasing speed and increasing thrust a controlled line up was no longer possible also resulting in the impossibility of a controlled and safe takeoff run.The crew did not adhere to the rolling takeoff requirements which would have required the nose wheel steering position at center. With the difficult surface conditions steering of the aircraft with nose wheel steering was more difficult.In any case, under the existing weather conditions and the fact that engine anti-ice was activated, the crew would have been required to use "static run up" (stop the aircraft holding the brakes while engines accelerate to 70% N1), which however did not happen.Graph of flight recorder data (Graphics: BFU):
An Air New Zealand Airbus A320-200, registration ZK-OJS performing flight NZ-526 from Christchurch to Auckland (New Zealand) with 170 people on board, rejected takeoff from Christchurch at low speed due to an indication and returned to the apron. A short time later the aircraft attempted another takeoff but again had to reject takeoff at low speed and returned to the apron again.Following examinations and a test run the aircraft was finally able to depart and reached Auckland with a delay of 4.5 hours.The airline confirmed takeoff was rejected twice due to an indication problem. Maintenance performed a test run, the aircraft subsequently reached Auckland without further incident.
A Southwest Airlines Boeing 737-300, registration N632SW performing flight WN-2855 from Oakland,CA to Las Vegas,NV (USA), rejected takeoff from Oakland's runway 29 at high speed after an engine ingested a bird. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron without requesting assistance. The crew reported they had the bird strike at about taxiway V about 1300 meters/4300 feet down the runway.The FAA reported no injuries occurred, the engine suffered unknown damage.
A Condor Boeing 757-300, registration D-ABOF performing flight DE-4398 from Frankfurt/Main (Germany) to Palma Mallorca,SP (Spain), rejected takeoff from Frankfurt's runway 18 at low speed when the left engine (RB211) stalled during engine acceleration for takeoff. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.A replacement Boeing 757-300 registration D-ABOG reached Palma Mallorca with a delay of 2:20 hours.
An Air Tanzania de Havilland Dash 8-300, registration 5H-MWG performing flight TC-119 from Kigoma to Dar es Salaam via Tabora (Tanzania) with 35 passengers and 4 crew, rejected takeoff from Kigoma's runway 34 due to an engine failure but overran the runway and came to a stop with the nose gear collapsed and the right wing including engine and right hand main gear separated at around 10:15L (07:15Z). Two elderly women were taken to a hospital with shock, the aircraft received substantial damage.No Metars are available for Kigoma, the local weather station reported calm winds, visibility above 30km, scattered clouds, temperatures between 20 and 29 degrees C, dew point constant at 20 degrees C, humidity between 93 and 56% between 03:00L and 12:00L.Kigoma offers a runway 16/34 of 1767 meters length, the threshold of runway 34 is currently displaced by 300 meters due to resurface works leaving a takeoff distance available of 1467 meters/4800 feet.Local Police reported the aircraft hit a pothole when it couldn't takeoff.5H-MWG off the runway:Map (Graphics: Google Earth):
An Air Canada Airbus A320-200, registration C-GQCA performing flight AC-7044 from Memphis,TN to Charlotte,NC (USA) with 48 people on board, rejected takeoff from Memphis at low speed (about 70 knots) after the crew received a lavatory smoke ECAM warning. The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway, emergency services responded, no trace of fire was found.The Canadian TSB reported examination by cabin crew revealed no anomaly with the lavatories.
A UTAir Boeing 737-500, registration VQ-BJM performing flight UT-462 from Tyumen to Moscow Domodedovo (Russia), rejected takeoff from Tyumen Airport at low speed about only 20 minutes after the crash of a company ATR-72, see Crash: UTAir AT72 near Tyumen on Apr 2nd 2012, lost height in initial climb, when the crew received a takeoff configuration alert. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.A replacement Tupolev TU-154M reached Moscow with a delay of 4 hours.
A US Airways Airbus A319-100, registration N836AW performing flight US-271 from Burbank,CA to Phoenix,AZ (USA) with 67 passengers and 5 crew, was cleared for takeoff from Burbank's runway 15. Immediately after the crew spooled the engines up for takeoff the left hand engine (V2524) emitted smoke. The crew reported they had a #1 engine failure as soon as they powered it up and had stopped on the runway wherever they were and requested emergency services to check the aircraft suspecting the smoke might come from the tyres. Emergency services responded and reported the smoke came from the #1 engine. The crew requested to check the left side of the aircraft for damage suspecting they may have temporarily exited the runway. Emergency services reported there was no visible damage to the aircraft, left landing gear and runway, but the engine was still emitting smoke.

A Southwest Airlines Boeing 737-700, registration N242WN performing flight WN-1322 from Houston Hobby,TX to Baltimore,MD (USA) with 135 passengers and 5 crew, had been cleared for takeoff from Houston Hobby Airport's runway 12R and had just rotated when the crew spotted a helicopter registration N6YJ ahead and above them and took evasive action, the helicopter crew reacted as well and took a sharp right turn away from the runway. Both aircraft completed their flights safely.FAA spokeswoman Lynn Lunsford said, that the news helicopter (call sign "Sky 2") had been cleared to takeoff from the south ramp in direction north, but took off to the south before turning north. The Southwest Boeing 737 was cleared to depart runway 12R followed by a left turn to the north. As the helicopter approached the runway, it passed above and ahead of the Southwest 737. The crew of the Southwest 737 saw the helicopter first and slowed their climb allowing the airplane to pass underneath the helicopter, the crew of the helicopter turned hard right away of the runway. Preliminary radar data suggest, that the helicopter was at 200 feet AGL, the 737 at 100 feet AGL with a minimum separation of 100 feet vertically and 125 feet laterally.The NTSB reported on May 3rd, that the aircraft came within an estimated 125 feet vertically and 100 feet laterally after both aircraft received takeoff clearances at about the same time and the helicopter converged into the flight path of the Boeing. The NTSB have dispatched an air traffic control specialist to investigate the near collision.On May 4th the NTSB released their first preliminary report correcting the minimum separation was 100 feet vertically and 125 feet laterally. The NTSB released testimony by both Southwest crew:Captain's testimony: "We were cleared for takeoff on runway 12R. I heard a helicopter also being cleared for takeoff somewhere else on the airport. At about the V1 call I saw the helicopter at my right one-a-clock as he flew southeast down taxiway November at about 50' off the ground. His flight path was in the same direction as ours but offset to the right several hundred feet. It appeared we would fly past him soon after rotation. However, just as I began to rotate, he started a left turn into our flight path. To avoid hitting him, I made a slow rotation and after liftoff kept us airborne just a few feet off the ground so that we would fly under him. This was my only option to avoid hitting him. Just before we flew under him he saw us and made a sharp hard turn back to the right. This turn prevented him from flying directly over us. I estimate we missed him by about 50' vertically and 100-200' horizontally. Listening to the conversation between him and the tower controller after we passed him it sounded like there was confusion between them about what direction he was supposed to head after his takeoff."First Officer's testimony: "I was the FO and [pilot monitoring]. We were cleared for takeoff on 12R. Approaching V1 we saw a helo taking off south of 12R and flying SE (parallel with the runway). During our rotation, the helo started to turn left and towards our flight path. The PF adjusted pitch to keep vertical spacing. The helo abruptly turned back to the right and passed high and off our right wing. I notified tower that the helo attempted to turn into us. The PF adjusted back to the normal profile after clearing the conflict and the remainder of the flight was normal."On Dec 28th 2011 the NTSB released their final report concluding the probable cause of the incident was:The failure of the local controller to issue control instructions necessary to ensure positive control/standard separation of traffic operating within the Class B airspace.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/SWA1322/history/20100428/1701Z/KHOU/KBWIAerodrome Chart (Graphics: FAA):
An Jazz Aviation de Havilland Dash 8-300, registration C-FTAK performing flight QK-8560 from Vancouver,BC to Smithers,BC (Canada) with 48 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff at about V1 when the crew thought they had a brief overspeed indication for engine #2 (PW123B), which had returned to normal however. In the climb the crew observed a higher fuel burn by the right hand engine as well as about 100 degrees C higher temperature. The crew declared emergency reporting "engine issues", levelled off at 14,000 feet and returned to Vancouver for a safe landing on runway 08L about 20 minutes after departure.A replacement Dash 8-300 reached Smithers with a delay of 1:45 hours.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/JZA560/history/20111222/1615Z/CYVR/CYYD
A Southwest Airlines Boeing 737-300, flight WN-2287 from Sacramento,CA to Seattle,WA (USA) with 130 passengers and 5 crew, rejected takeoff from Sacramento's runway 16R at high speed after two main gear tyres burst.

A SAA South African Airways Airbus A340-300, registration ZS-SXE performing flight SA-334 from Cape Town to Johannesburg (South Africa), rejected takeoff from Cape Town's runway 19 at high speed due to problems with one of the right hand engines (CFM56). The airplane slowed safely and stopped about 1300 meters/4300 feet down the runway, emergency services responded and checked the brakes. About 10 minutes later the aircraft was able to taxi to the apron.The airport confirmed the aircraft rejected takeoff due to technical reasons.
An Aigle Azur Boeing 737-200 on behalf of Corsair, registration F-GMJD performing a flight from Paris Orly (France) to Malta (Malta) with 127 passengers and 5 crew, was accelerating through 150 knots for takeoff from Orly's runway 08, when the crew felt a strong impact. The crew continued the takeoff, in the climb the crew noticed "DOORS" and "FWD ENTRY" indications had illuminated. The crew decided to return to Orly, tower reported however that a concrete block had been found on the runway. Due to the closure of runway 08 the aircraft diverted to Paris Charles de Gaulle for a safe landing. No injuries occurred, the aircraft received substantial damage however.France's Bureau dEnquetes et dAnalyses (BEA) released their final report in French more than 12 years later concluding the probable cause of the accident was:Inadequate materials used for runway maintenance and non-compliance with technical instructions by the company carrying out the work. Contributing were operational constraints opening, inspection requirements and the use of quick hardening materials for repairs.The BEA reported that about 2 minutes prior to the accident takeoff run an Air France Airbus A320 had taken off the runway and caused a loose filling come out of its cavity at the intersection of runway 08/26 and 02/20 with its left main gear. When the Air France crew reported on departure frequency they had observed an irregularity with a runway light the accident flight had already departed, too.A hole of 30cm (11.8 inches) in diameter and 20cm (7.9 inches) depth was found on the runway center line about 1800 meters from the threshold of runway 26.The aircraft received a dent 20cm by 30cm (7.9in by 11.8in) and a hole 30 cm by 30 cm (11.8in by 11.8in) just behind the VHF antenna on the underside of the fuselage.The investgation was not able to determine, whether the large impact was the result of the nose gear running through the cavity and throw additional material out against the fuselage or a collision with a piece of concrete outside the cavity that got thrown against the fuselage or a combination of both scenarios.11 days prior to the accident flight repair works had been carried out on runway 08 after material degradation had been observed with the runway center line lights. A composite material of concrete and resin was used to carry out the repairs, that required the material to be cut into exact angles and required a specific time to dry out and harden.The damage to the underside of the aircraft (Photo: BEA):Details of the damage (Photo: BEA):
A Dniproavia Embraer ERJ-145, registration UR-DNB performing flight Z6-4 from Dnepropetrovsk to Kiev Borispil (Ukraine), rejected takeoff from Dnepropetrovsk at high speed (just above 80 knots) when the crew received a red unsafe indication for the nose gear. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.Ukraine's Ministry of Transport reported in their monthly bulletin that the crew had already received two amber unsafe indications for the nose gear on their EICAS display while taxiing for departure. An out of position proximity sensor was identified causing the indications. The MoT criticised that no guidance was provided in case of an amber unsafe indication for the gear during taxi and recommended to introduce clear guidance for flight crew how to react to amber gear indications in various stages of flight.
A Skywest Airlines Canadair CRJ-200, registration N403SW performing flight OO-5652 from San Francisco,CA to Redmond,OR (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from San Francisco's runway 01L when the #2 engine (CF34, right hand) ingested a bird prompting the crew to reject takeoff at high speed. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron without the crew requesting assistance.The FAA reported the aircraft received minor damage.A replacement CRJ-200 registration N652BR reached Redmond with a delay of 4 hours.
An Aerolineas Argentinas Boeing 737-700, registration LV-CBS performing flight AR-1363 from Santa Cruz (Bolivia) to Buenos Aires Ezeiza,BA (Argentina), rejected takeoff from runway 16 at high speed after a nose wheel tyre burst. The aircraft slowed safely and stopped on the runway about half way down the runway (length 3500 meters/11500 feet).The airport was closed for several hours until the aircraft was towed off the runway.
The ATSB released their bulletin reporting that the crew intended to depart from the runway intersection and were intending to brief their departure accordingly, however, both pilots inadvertently used the performance charts for the full length runway (takeoff distance available 3444 meters/11300 feet).The captain had been pilot monitoring for the leg and therefore had computed the takeoff performance, with the intention of a flex takeoff, before leaving the cockpit for the walk around. The first officer, pilot flying, checked the takeoff performance computations and found an error, corrected the errors but inadvertently also used the full length runway performance chart that had been bookmarked by the captain. When the captain returned to the cockpit, the first officer made the captain aware of the error, the captain rechecked the performance calculation again referring to the performance chart that he had bookmarked. The crew determined their V1 was 160 KIAS.The aircraft subsequently taxied to the runway intersection with taxiway B and commenced takeoff from there, takeoff distance available from there was 2316 meters/7600 feet. Although acceleration seemed normal, the captain decided while accelerating through about 120-130 KIAS that the remaining runway looked insufficient to stop in case of an engine failure and decided to not reject takeoff even if still below V1. The thrust was not increased. The aircraft became safely airborne about 1500 feet short of the runway end. Due to performance issues at takeoff the crew reviewed the takeoff computations while in cruise and discovered that they had referenced an incorrect runway performance chart. Using the correct performance chart the V1 would have been in the range between 138 and 144 KIAS.The ATSB analysed, had the crew needed to reject takeoff at V1 (160 KIAS), they would have needed 1000 meters additional runway length. Had an engine failed at or above V1 obstacle clearance would have been compromised unless the runway was 150 meters longer.The operator immediately addressed the problem by sending out a safety message to all their A320 and A330 crew: "Bookmarking the page by the PNF [pilot not flying] is not acceptable. This practice must cease immediately."
An Aerosur Boeing 737-300, registration CP-2640 performing flight 5L-210 from La Paz to Santa Cruz (Bolivia), rejected takeoff from La Paz at high speed after at least one main gear tyre burst. The aircraft slowed safely and came to a stop about half way down the runway, then attempted to vacate the runway but needed to stop a second time when more tyres deflated and was disabled on the runway with 3 main gear tyres deflated.The runway was closed for about 5 hours forcing the airport to suspend all operation for that time, too.
A Thomas Cook Airbus A321-200, registration G-NIKO performing flight MT-2464 from Manchester,EN (UK) to Heraklion (Greece) with 223 passengers and 8 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from runway 05L when the crew initiated rotation, however felt the "sidestick control was heavier than expected". After the aircraft became airborne, the lowest selectable airspeed indication moved too far upwards on the primary flight display. The captain reduced the pitch angle to accelerate the aircraft and covered the thrust levers in case more thrust was needed. The aircraft accelerated and climbed however at a slower rate than normal. Later in cruise the crew checked the performance data and realized they had used the zero fuel weight instead of the takeoff weight for their takeoff computation and programming the FMS. The aircraft continued to Heraklion for a safe landing.The British AAIB released their bulletin reporting the aircraft was 17,000 kg/ 37500 lbs heavier than the weight of 69,638 kg/ 153,400 lbs used in the computations for takeoff.The captain had just received the loadsheet and was checking the loadsheet, when the first officer inquired about the takeoff weight to be used for takeoff computations. The commander read out what he believed was the takeoff weight, but mistakenly read the field for zero fuel weight. The first officer used that weight for takeoff computations, the captain took the figure down onto his navigation log, and cross checked the value with the line printed below on the navigation log (which is estimated zero fuel weight) instead of the line above (estimated takeoff weight).The AAIB analysed that the crew missed a number of opportunities to detect the discrepancy following standard operating procedures, most notably both pilots missed the cross check of the green dot speed computed by the FMS and by their laptops doing the takeoff computations. The FMS does not permit to enter the takeoff weight directly, but works off the zero fuel weight. Hence "the erroneous data entry into the laptop computer could not have been replicated in the FMS".
The Dutch Onderzoeksraad (Dutch Safety Board DSB) released their final report in Dutch (the English version was released on Dec 7th 2011) concluding the probable causes of the accident (translated from the Dutch report by The Aviation Herald) were:1. Shortly after takeoff a collision with a bird caused damage to the left hand engine which reduced the available thrust from that engine to about 45%. The crew decided correctly to return to Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport.2. The implementation of the return however were not in line with standard operating procedures, the deviations were:- the execution of a right hand turn at 260 feet AGL with a bank angle of 37.5 degrees instead of continuing straight until minimum safe altitude has been reached and the gear has been retracted- after the gear had retracted it was extended again at very low altitude- the undamaged right hand engine was reduced from 94% to 83% N1 instead of utilising its maximum thrust availableThese deviations from standard operating procedures meant the aircraft was not able to climb to minimum safe altitude, the crew had difficulty controlling the aircraft and was distracted by a number of audio and visual warnings that resulted from unfinished cockpit procedures.3. Communication and interaction between the two pilots was not according to international standards established for airline pilots. The immediate right turn led to a marginal remaining flight performance, more difficult tasks and complications, so that both pilots did not execute their duties like handling procedures and checklists in the prescribed manner. This introduced new complications like unnecessary warnings and unstable flight.4. Training of Royal Air Maroc and Atlas Blue did not prepare flight crew for multiple failures in flight. - Prior to any refresher training the crew was told which failures were to expect. While this is not unusual, the training could not cater for surprise effects.- Dealing with multiple faults was included only in the initial training for captains.- Although the flight crew training manual as well as flight crew operations manual contained procedures and checklists to appropriately address the faults, that occurred during this flight, the managers at Royal Air Maroc and Atlas Blue considered this occurrence a unique event that can not be trained for.5. There was insufficient account of aircraft in distress below minimum vector altitude taken in studies of necessary actions following the recommendations of the Parliamentary Inquiry Commission investigating the Bijlmer plane crash (editorial note: the crash of El Al's Boeing 747-200 4X-AXG into an apartment block at Bijlmermeer on Oct 4th 1992). Those aircraft will be in the local control zone of Schiphol, the controllers however are without information of high obstacles in the control zone creating an unnecessarily increased risk of collision. This is especially true if flown outside visual meteorologic conditions.- Research of Dutch Traffic Control following the recommendations of the Parliamentary Inquiry Commission into the Bijlmer crash led to a framework of policies to guide aircraft in distress while flying above the town. The policies establish that the aircraft commander is responsible for flight while air traffic control is responsible to grant all available assistance to the commander, while air traffic control should keep the aircraft as much as possible within the established departure and arrival routes into the runways to limit overflying built up areas. Although the Directorate General for Aviation and Marimite Affairs agreed with these policies, the radar screens of air traffic controller do not depict built up areas.- Around Schiphol Airport high buildings are virtually everywhere in populated areas. It is therefore not feasable to maneouver in those areas avoiding the obstacles considering the speed and turn radii of aircraft. The aircraft reached a maximum altitude of 730 feet well below the minimum vectoring altitude of 1200 feet. Only two obstacles were depicted on the controller's radar screen, however, there is a high number of obstacles in the control zone that pose a risk to aircraft flying below minimum vectoring altitude, which is especially true if flown outside visual meteorological conditions.6. The presence of one or more birds with a large mass in the flight trajectory of an aircraft pose a safety risk, especially true for geese because of their high mass and because of them flying in flocks. Most bird strikes occur during takeoff and landing.7. Research has shown that the responsible parties to control wild life at Schiphol Airport have exhausted their options. Besides frequently closing runways it is necessary to further reduce the risk of bird strikes in the area of responsibilities of other parties.8. All relevant aviation, agricultural, bird and nature parties recognize the risk of bird strikes and the need to reduce that risk. Despite the concensus on these necessities there is no concensus on the impact of those necessities resulting in different views on the (cost) effective implementation of these measures.9. The urgency of a flight can not wait for the outcomes of studies of control measures that short term reduce populations of geese as most effective methode to reduce the risk of bird strikes and long term result in a habitat management, detection of birds and deterrence capabilities in view of structural reduction of bird strike risks.10. Several Non-Government Organisations have joined in the "Geese-7" initiative to reduce and stabilize the populations of various types of geese at a certain size. The implementation of these recommendations is pending awaiting decision by the Ministry of Economy, Agriculture and Innovation.11. The Ministry of Economy, Agriculture and Innovation, also responsible for flight safety, has not exercised adequate control of bird strike risks.The Royal Air Maroc Boeing 737-400 CN-RMF with 156 passengers, 4 Royal Air Maroc cabin crew and 2 Atlas Blue pilots, the captain (36, ATPL, 7,540 hours total, 7,200 hours on type) being pilot flying and the first officer (28, ATPL, 2,730 hours total, 2,308 hours on type) being pilot monitoring, departed Schiphol Airport's runway 18L, flaps were set at 5 degrees, engines stabilized at 93.8 and 94.0% N1. The aircraft accelerated through 171 KIAS during rotation (nose up attitude of 6 degrees) and became airborne, at 16 feet AGL the gear was selected up at a speed of 175 KIAS. At that moment the aircraft collided with a flock of geese, which resulted in an immediate loss of all thrust from the left hand engine, the nose landing gear indicated unsafe because of the position of the nose gear did not agree with the selected position. 6 seconds later the aircraft climbed through 140 feet at engine thrust of 45.5% N1 and 93.8% N1, the left engine remained at 45% N1 for the next 4 minutes until shut down. The first officer called out engine #1 was damaged, the call was not responded to by the captain however. The captain remarked that the aircraft was shaking violently and was difficult to control. By himself, without sharing his thoughts with the first officer, he wondered whether both engines had been damaged so that insufficient thrust remained available to sustain flight, therefore he wanted to return immediately considering the decision to return was obvious. He instructed the first officer to select the landing gear down again and declare Mayday, the first officer selected the landing gear down without discussion, then declared emergency.At a height of 280 feet the commander initiated a right hand turn. Despite the gear being selected down the nose gear continued to indicate unsafe. By the time the first officer completed the Mayday call the aircraft had already reached a bank angle of 21 degrees, the controller recognizing the right turn instructed the aircraft to roll out at 330 degrees and expect vectors for runway 18R. The aircraft reached a maximum bank angle of 37.5 degrees (according to flight data recorder) at an airspeed that reduced from 179 to 156 KIAS. The right hand engine's thrust lever was manually reduced to 83% N1 despite autothrottle being engaged, autothrottle was subsequently disengaged. The aircraft continued to climb slowly reaching 498 feet AGL before descending again at low rate, the GPWS sounded "Don't sink! Don't sink!", the airspeed continued to decrease through 145 KIAS. 60 seconds after initiating the turn the aircraft finally rolled wings level at a heading of 344 degrees. The captain then requested the first officer to repeat the instructions received from air traffic control and noticed that the nose gear indicated unsafe, the discussion however got interrupted by the purser who called the cockpit reporting the left hand engine was on fire. The captain ignored that message and instead instructed the first officer to tell the cabin crew they were returning to Schiphol. During the next 23 seconds the air traffic controller inquired with the first officer whether the aircraft was able to maintain altitude and whether they could accept vectors, the captain talked to the purser who repeated the left engine was on fire, the GPWS activated a number of times prompting the right thrust lever to be pushed forward until the engine reached 101% N1 and the aircraft began to climb again. After the first officer had finished the transmissions with ATC the captain requested the information to be repeated. The aircraft reached 352 feet and began to descend again, the GPWS again activated "Don't sink!" and "Too Low, Terrain!".The purser entered the cockpit, the first officer asked him to verify through the peep hole whether the nose gear was extended, then responded to a radio transmission by ATC, which transferred the aircraft onto a discrete frequency (a frequency with no other aircraft on). The purser confirmed the nose gear was down and locked.The captain increased the right hand thrust lever further to just below firewall, the aircraft began to climb again, the GPWS alerts ceased but nose landing gear warnings now sounded. While the two pilots discussed the new warning ATC issued a heading of 350 degrees to join the downwind for runway 18R and asked whether the aircraft was able to climb, which the crew replied in the negative to.The gear warning ceased when the aircraft overflew the villages of Vijfhuizen and Haarlem at heights of 380 to 500 feet. When the aircraft was north of these villages ATC issued a new heading of 100 degrees and advised they were 4 miles from touchdown. The captain initiated the turn but rolled out at 065 degrees, the left hand engine was shut down following the memory checklist "Engine Fire or severe damage or separation", while the memory checklist was executed ATC issued heading 160, the instruction was not responded to and was not followed. ATC issued a heading of 210 degrees, the instruction was again not followed, only a minor right turn followed. By that time the crew had completed the memory checklist and found the aircraft north of the aerodrome passing through the extended centerline of runway 18L. ATC issued a heading of 270 to return the aircraft to runway 18R, the crew completed the rest of the checklists concerning the left engine and completed programming of the flight management computer, the aircraft turned through 110 degrees, the first officer inquired with ATC for vectors and was again instructed to turn onto a heading of 270. The crew inquired whether a landing on runway 18L was possible, the approach controller declined because of obstacle clearance (Sony Building) just north of runway 18L. The crew discussed the aircraft was difficult to control, although the engine thrust was constant the airspeed was fluctuating between 160 and 170 knots, the first officer called speed when the airspeed decrased to 156 KIAS. The captain attempted to adjust the right hand thrust lever but noticed it was already at maximum thrust and instructed to firewall the engine for 5 seconds (103.9% N1). The crew, seeing runway 18C, inquired whether a landing on 18C was possible, which was approved, however, the crew reconsidered and decided to go ahead with the original plan to land on runway 18R, the aircraft was heading at 310 degrees. ATC issued a heading to 215 degrees, the first officer called the instruction out aloud and assisted the captain performing the turn with verbal callouts. The captain captured the localizer manually and flew the ILS with flaps still at 5 degrees. On final approach the captain instructed the first officer to advise cabin crew to not evacuate but prepare for a hard landing. The first officer did not pass that message because the aircraft was already on short final and the first officer called out speeds and sinkrates in order to assist the captain. After main wheel touch down at 175 KIAS the first officer announced the automatic wheel brakes did not engage, the captain instructed to turn the system off, the first officer suggested to keep those nose up as long as possible, followed by a safe touchdown of the nose gear. While the aircraft rolled out the captain again instructed that no evacuation would be done unless there was fire. The aircraft came to a stop on the runway, the right hand engine was shut down.Emergency services reported no smoke or fire. The right main gear tyres deflated. The passenger disembarked via mobile stairs.The remains of 24 geese were found in the left main landing gear, the nose landing gear and the electronic compartment. Examination of the aircraft revealed:- dents in the underside of the fuselage near the nose of the aircraft- a dent in the leading edge of the vertical fin- dents and cracks at the leading edge of the left hand engine's inlet and dents inside the engine- three fanblades fractured at about midspan damaging all the rest of the fan blades- the left engine's low and high pressure compressor, the combustion chamber, high pressure turbine guide vanes, high pressure turbine blades, low pressure turbine outlet guide vanes, and first to fourth low pressure turbine stages were all damaged- on the left side of the left hand engine was soot and oil- on the fuselage were traces of oil- the right main gear brakes were jammedPollution with engine oil was reported from the village of Harleem, the investigation however could not establish the source of the oil spill stating that the aircraft did not overfly the specific area in question.Immediately after departure of the Boeing Schiphol operations were advised of a possible bird strike on runway 18L and recovered the remains of 7 dead Canada Geese, weights between 3 and 5 kg (6.6 to 11 lbs) from runway 18L around about the extended centerline of runway 06/24.Bird remains on the left main gear (Photo: DSB):
A Perimeter Aviation de Havilland Dash 8-100, registration C-FOFR performing flight 4B-621 from Winnipeg,MB to Sainte Therese Point,MB (Canada) with 40 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff on Winnipeg's runway 36 (available takeoff distance 11,984 feet/3,650 meters) when prior to rotation the crew noticed the left hand stall warning light to intermittently illuminate. After the main wheels became airborne the stick shaker activated continuously and the left stall warning light illuminated continuously. The crew decided to reject takeoff, settled the main gear back onto the runway, slowed safely and returned to the apron. The Canadian TSB reported the left stall vane was stuck in the stall position. The #1 stall computer was replaced and the aircraft returned to service.Metars:CYWG 301800Z 02011G16KT 15SM SCT008 OVC020 M02/M03 A3005 RMK SF4SC4 SLP192 CYWG 301735Z 02009KT 15SM FEW007 BKN020 OVC120 M02/ RMK SF2SC3AC2CYWG 301700Z 02009KT 15SM SCT015 OVC120 M03/M04 A3005 RMK SC3AC4 SLP188 CYWG 301600Z 03007KT 15SM FEW091 OVC120 M04/M05 A3002 RMK AC1AC6 SLP180 CYWG 301500Z 02008KT 15SM SCT091 OVC120 M04/M05 A3000 RMK AC2AC5 SLP173 CYWG 301400Z 01009KT 15SM OVC120 M03/M05 A2998 RMK AC8 SLP166 
A China Eastern Airbus A330-200, registration B-6099 performing flight MU-298 from Hamburg to Frankfurt/Main (Germany), rejected takeoff from Hamburg's runway 23 at low speed due to an abnormal engine (Trent 772) indication and returned to the apron.The aircraft was able to depart about 2 hours later and continued to Shanghai (China) via Frankfurt.
A China Eastern Airlines Airbus A330-200, registration B-6122 performing flight MU-516 from Osaka Kansai (Japan) to Shanghai (China) with 245 people on board, had been cleared to line up and wait, however began its takeoff run without clearance. The tower controller instructed the aircraft to stop, the crew however continued the takeoff, the aircraft became airborne and continued to Shanghai for a safe landing.While the aircraft was lining up on the departure runway a helicopter on approach to Kansai Airport had been maneouvering near the runway.Japan's Ministry of Transport have opened an investigation.
A Bukovyna British Aerospace BAe 146-300, registration UR-CJM performing flight BKV-4011 from Kiev Borispil (Ukraine) to Tehran (Iran), was accelerating for takeoff from Kiev's Borispil Airport when both air speed indicators did not come alive. The captain rejected takeoff, the aircraft returned to the apron.The Ukrainian Ministry of Transport reported in their November Bulletin in Ukrainian that both pitot tubes #1 and #2 were found blocked by insects. The insects were able to enter the pitot tubes due to poor condition of the pitot tube covers and lack of checks of the caps.
A Transaero Boeing 747-400, registration VP-BVR performing flight UN-136 from Khabarovsk to Moscow Domodedovo (Russia) with 349 passengers and 18 crew, rejected takeoff from Khabarovsk at low speed when engines #1 (RB211, outboard left) and #3 (inboard right) did not reach their takeoff thrust. The airplane slowed safely and returned to the apron. A replacement Boeing 747-400 registration VQ-BHX reached Moscow with a delay of 14 hours.Rosaviatsia have initiated an investigation.
An Air Canada Airbus A319-100, registration C-GITP performing flight AC-942 from Toronto,ON (Canada) to Bermuda (Bermuda) with 110 people on board, rejected takeoff from Toronto's runway 24R at high speed (approx. 115 knots) after the right hand engine (CFM56) surged. The airplane slowed safely, emergency services responded due to hot brakes and subsequently escorted the aircraft to the apron.A replacement A319 reached Bermuda with a delay of 2:10 hours.The Canadian TSB reported maintenance replaced the #2 engine's hydro mechanical unit (HMU) and returned the aircraft to service.
A Garuda Indonesia Boeing 737-400, registration PK-GWK performing flight GA-602 from Jakarta to Makassar (Indonesia), was accelerating for takeoff on Jakarta's runway 25R. After the aircraft became airborne the crew felt strong vibrations, all engine indications were normal however. The vibrations ceased when the gear reached the retracted position. In the absence of abnormal indications the crew decided to continue the flight, a company aircraft departing after GA-602 reported that they had spotted tyre debris on the runway. On approach to Makassar the crew prepared for a landing with a burst tyre, decided to burn off fuel in order to reduce landing weight and entered a holding for about 30 minutes although the aircraft was already blow maximum landing weight. The crew subsequently performed a low approach to 400 feet to have the tower inspect the landing gear, the tower reported an anomaly on the left main gear tyres however could not identify whether it was the inboard or outboard tyre. The aircraft subsequently landed safely and vacated the runway onto taxiway A, where the passengers disembarked.A postflight inspection showed the inboard left main tyre was damaged, tyre debris had gone through the trailing edge of the left hand flap.A runway inspection in Jakarta not only recovered tyre debris but also a number of pieces of concrete.Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) released their final report concluding the probably cause of the accident was:- The X form of damage indicated that a pointed object was rolled over by the tire causing tire burst. The pointed object could be one of the broken pieces of concrete.- The tire burst peeled off the thread. The broken pieces of concrete and/ or the tire hit and damaged the left aft flap tearing through the flap thickness.The NTSC reported that the runway had been repaired using asphalt the night before the accident, in the early morning of Apr 12th the runway had been sweeped. However, after the departure of PK-GWK several pieces of concrete were found on the shoulder of the runway.The tyre damage originated from a single spot in form of an "X" indicating the tyre had run over a sharp object and ruptured. The tread separated from the tyre and the tyre burst.The NTSC analysed it was possible one of the found pieces of concrete was run over by the tyre resulting in the damage.The pieces of concrete (Photo: NTSC):The tyre damage (Photo: NTSC):The flap damage (Photo: NTSC):
An Expressjet Embraer ERJ-145 on behalf of Continental Airlines, registration N17115 performing flight XE-4663/Co-4663 from Nashville,TN to Newark,NJ (USA), was departing with a delay of about 2:15 hours. The aircraft rejected takeoff from Nashville's runway 02L when the crew received a takeoff configuration warning. The airplane slowed safely and vacated the runway. The crew subsequently determined they needed to return to the gate to have maintenance check the aircraft.About 20-30 minutes at the gate maintenance released the aircraft, which could now depart and reached Newark with a total delay of 3 hours.A passenger reported, that following the rejected takeoff the captain announced they received a warning that flaps were incorrectly configured for takeoff.
A Ryanair Boeing 737-800, registration EI-EFG performing flight FR-5275 from Zaragoza,SP to Sevilla,SP (Spain) with 80 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff on Zaragoza's runway 30R when the crew noticed a vehicle stopped on the left side of the runway. Considering the distance to the vehicle and the speed of the aircraft the crew elected to continue the takeoff and cleared the vehicle overflying it in about 120-150 feet. The aircraft continued for a safe landing in Sevilla.Spains CIAIAC opened an investigation into the serious incident.
A Continental Airlines Boeing 757-200, registration N17128 performing flight CO-96 from Newark,NJ (USA) to Berlin Tegel (Germany), rejected takeoff from Newark's runway 22R at high speed due to disagreeing airspeed indications. The aircraft slowed safely, vacated the runway and stopped on the adjacent taxiway, emergency services needed to cool the left hand brakes before the aircraft was towed to the apron.A replacement Boeing 757-200 registration N29124 reached Berlin with a delay of 4 hours.A passenger reported the captain subsequently explained they had difficulty "achieving airspeed" and "lost some gauges". 
A Condor Boeing 757-300, registration D-ABOK performing flight DE-1486 from Frankfurt/Main (Germany) to Tenerife Sur Reina Sofia,CI (Spain), was accelerating for takeoff from Frankfurt's runway 18, when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed due to severe vibrations. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.Following checks the aircraft was able to depart again and reached Tenerife with a delay of 7.5 hours.The German BFU reported the crew rejected takeoff at 100 knots due to severe vibrations as result of irregularities of the runway surface.A passenger video recorded taxi onto runway, the takeoff run as well as the captain's announcement, that the takeoff was rejected because of the runway being bumpy, the runway had been repaired the previous night but obviously something wasn't done right.The passenger video (Video: ELS-DISPO)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgggJ_KO2GI
An Allegiant Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-83, registration N864GA performing flight G4-357 from Medford,OR to Las Vegas,NV (USA), was accelerating for takeoff from Medford when a loud bang was heard from an engine (JT8D) prompting the crew to reject takeoff at high speed. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron. The FAA reported a subsequent runway inspection needed to remove metallic debris of a blown engine from the runway.A replacement MD-83 has been dispatched to Medford and is estimated to reach Las Vegas with a delay of 6 hours.
An Air Canada Jazz de Havilland Dash 8-100, registration C-GONN performing flight QK-8034 from Toronto,ON (Canada) to Pittsburg,PA (USA) with 23 people on board, rotated for takeoff when the crew received a left hand engine (PW121) oil pressure caution indication. After climbing to 3400 feet the crew shut the engine down and returned to Toronto for a safe landing on runway 24R about 30 minutes after departure.The flight was cancelled.The Canadian TSB reported maintenance replaced the oil pressure switch and the associated wiring.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/JZA34/history/20111017/1315Z/CYYZ/KPIT
A Dniproavia Boeing 737-500, registration UR-DND performing flight Z6-6018 from Odessa to Kiev Borispol (Ukraine), had just rotated for takeoff when the crew felt a brief change in the operating parameters of the right hand engine (CFM56) followed by vibrations of about 1.0-1.2 units. As the vibrations were within permitted limits, the crew decided to continue the flight to Kiev for a safe landing.Ukraine's Ministry of Transport reported in their monthly bulletin in Ukrainian that a post flight inspection revealed damage to the compressor blades 32,33 and 34 as result of a bird strike.
An Arkefly Boeing 767-300, registration PH-OYJ performing flight OR-465 (dep Oct 26th) from Goa (India) to Colombo (Sri Lanka) with 263 passengers on board, rejected takeoff from Goa after the right hand engine (CF6) ingested a bird. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.The airline reported the passengers were taken to hotels pending further transportation. The engine ingested a bird and received damage. The flight had originated in Amsterdam (Netherlands) on Oct 26th and was bound for Colombo via an intermediate stop in Goa.A replacement Boeing 767-300 registration PH-AHQ has been dispatched to Goa departing Amsterdam on Oct 28th and reached Colombo with a delay of 38.5 hours. The return flight OR-466 reached Amsterdam with a delay of 37.5 hours.The incident aircraft was repaired by a technical team flown to Goa, departed Goa on Oct 29th, reached Amsterdam about 48 hours after scheduled arrival and resumed service the same evening.
The Danish Havarikommission (HCL) have released their final report in Danish concluding:The incident occurred when runway 04L was used for both takeoff and landing. The commission believes the involved pilots' decisions were influenced by various operative factors which cumulatively resulted in the majority of defense barriers being weakened while the aircraft was taxiing in marginal runway/taxiway conditions and just after a switch of the takeoff runway from 04R to 04L.Contributing factors were:- the first officer had a resource intensive previous leg- change of weather conditions- takeoff preparations and computations produced a mental picture/mindset for takeoff from runway 04R- change of the runway- "home syndrome"- re-programming of flight management system during taxi- stop lights at taxiway A7 were turned off (lack of defense barrier), had the stop lights been lit the crew would most likely have become aware they were taxiing into an area without clearanceThe HCL reported that the minimum separation between the aircraft reduced to 175 feet vertical and 19.5 meters (64 feet) horizontal.The captain (ATPL, 5548 hours total, 808 hours on type) of the CRJ-900 had arrived in Copenhagen 37 minutes prior to the incident flight, the first officer (ATPL, 8036 hours total, 1123 hours on type) had arrived on another flight 118 minutes prior to the incident flight. The captain was assigned pilot flying for the sector to Vilnius, the crew met at the aircraft and planned/briefed their flight inside the aircraft, both pilots later reported they conducting the planning and briefing without undue stress. The crew planned and computed their departure from runway 04R. After push back the aircraft taxied to de-icing pad V and subsequently was cleared to taxi via taxiways W, W1, R, R2 and B hold short of runway 12/30. The aircraft was held there for about 15 minutes due to continuing snow fall, the crew used the time to discuss runway conditions including brake coefficients and winds. The crew concluded that the runway conditions and friction values were no longer suitable for a takeoff from runway 04R. Friction values and runway conditions of runway 04L however were still suitable, hence the crew requested departure from runway 04L. The aircraft was therefore cleared to taxi via taxiways D and A hold short of runway 04L. The taxiways were covered with snow, the green taxiway center line lighting was visible only with difficulty. The captain had never taxied to runway 04L before, the first officer had done that taxi route only a very few times. The crew noticed on the charts that taxiway A turned slightly left and then right just at the fire station. While the captain taxied along their assigned route the first officer was doing the takeoff computations for runway 04L.Just when the aircraft reached taxiway A the new takeoff computations had been completed, were verified and the first officer began to input the data into the flight management system with his head down while the captain was steering the aircraft along taxiway A, the first officer not cross checking their position on the taxiway. When the aircraft reached the intersection A/A7 the aircraft turned left, but the captain did not see the turn to the right and thus followed A7 instead of A. A short time later the first officer exclaimed "You are about to enter the runway", the captain applied the brakes. The aircraft slid and came to a stop at the runway edge. The crew radioed tower they had to stop, a second later the departing CRJ-200 passed the CRJ-900 already climbing through a height of 175 feet and at a horizontal distance of 19.5 meters.The HCL reported the crew of a third aircraft needed to use all their resources available to identify the proper taxiway route to keep on taxiway A. That crew also reported that the taxiway lighting at intersection A7 and A was running towards A7, not towards A.The HCL reported the first officer had been very work intensive due to a technical malfunction of the aircraft.The runway guard light system including the red illuminated runway signs and stopbars was lit and functional, however, the stop bar red lights however had been turned off before the incident due to snow fall. The commission analysed that the runway signs and the stop bar, meant to be a visual defense against runway incursion, was overshadowed by the large amount of resources/attention needed by the captain to follow the taxiway center line and thus lost its role as a defensive barrier. Had the stop bar red lights been turned on however the crew would most likely have become aware of taxiing into an area which would require proper clearance.The runway incursion monitoring system at the airport was also deactivated due to the snowfall.The hold short stop line at A7 in daylight, stop bar lights off, taxiway center line lighting on (Photo: HCL):
A Lufthansa Airbus A340-600, registration D-AIHF performing flight LH-459 from San Francisco,CA (USA) to Munich (Germany), was accelerating for takeoff on San Francisco's runway 28L when the crew rejected takeoff at high speed reporting an engine problem and requesting no assistance. The aircraft vacated the runway via a high speed turn off and taxied to apron.A passenger reported the crew announced they had a computer malfunction. About two hours later the flight was cancelled, they were taken to hotels.The incident aircraft reached Munich two days later and resumed regular schedule thereafter.
The ATSB released their final report concluding the following safety factors contributed to the incident:- The pilot in command rejected the takeoff due to a sudden and unexpected yaw that was initially identified as an engine failure, but was later found to be the effect of a lateral wind gust (lateral jerk).Other key findings- Emergency services responded to flame and smoke from the wheels, but were not required to dispense any extinguishing agent.The captain (ATPL, 19,000 hours total, 5,000 hours on type) was pilot flying when the aircraft accelerated on runway 03. Little to no rudder input was necessary to maintain the runway center line, however, when the aircraft accelerated through 100 KIAS the captain felt a sudden and unexpected sharp yaw that felt like an engine failure. He instinctively applied rudder input and rejected the takeoff. Unlike in an engine failure there was little resistance to the rudder application, a look onto the engine instruments showed no indication of an engine failure, however, after having rejected the takeoff the captain was committed to stop the aircraft. The aircraft briefly stopped on the runway and taxied off the runway onto taxiway D, where tower advised seeing smoke from the area of the left main gear. Emergency services responded, the fire station manager reported seeing flames from a left main wheel. The flames did not sustain, firefighters therefore did not dispense any extinguishing agent therefore, instead monitored the brakes until they had been cooled down to a safe temperature by cooling fans.The ATSB reported that the data off the flight data recorder showed the deviation to the left began without any rudder input or engine asymmetry when the aircraft accelerated through 111 knots ground speed. One second later, at a ground speed of 115 knots, the captain applied right rudder, both engines were reduced to idle, then idle reverse was selected, the brakes were applied and ground spoilers deployed. Analysis of the flight parameters suggest the deviation and left acceleration were caused by a right lateral wind gradient (gust).The ATSB analysed: "The investigation did not identify any organisational or systemic issues that might adversely affect the future safety of aviation operations. However, the occurrence does provide a timely reminder of the risks associated with rejected takeoffs at relatively high speeds, such as wheel fires. Pilot awareness of their potential exposure to sudden and unexpected lateral wind gusts during takeoff may increase the likelihood of pilots differentiating between a lateral jerk and the effect of an engine failure."Graphical representation of FDR (Graphics: ATSB):

South Africa's Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) have released their final report concluding the probable cause of the accident was:Engine failure after takeoff followed by inappropriate crew response, resulting in the loss of both lateral and directional control, the misidentification of the failed engine, and subsequent shutdown of the remaining serviceable engine.Contributing factors:- Separation of the second-stage turbine seal plate rim;- Failure of the captain and first officer to implement any crew resource management procedures as prescribed in the operators training manual;- The crews failure to follow the correct after take-off engine failure procedures as prescribed in the aircrafts flight manual.The CAA reported in addition to the preliminary report, that the captain (40, ATPL, 2,956 hours total, 751 hours on type) had been upgraded to captain just 14 days prior to the accident. The captain had already been involved in another accident on Aug 21st 2005 when during a charter flight to Virgina Aerodrome (South Africa) the aircraft on short final to runway 05 veered left off the extended center line of the runway, the pilot reported engine problems and a go-around, the aircraft continued to turn left towards a residential area, the aircraft struck the roof of a home with the left wing and nose and came to rest in an inverted tail high position.The first officer (26, ATPL, 2,002 hours total, 1,027 hours on type) received her ATPL just 16 days prior to the accident, she held a CPL since 2005.Both crew had flown together the previous day and had a rest of 9:45 hours prior to the accident flight.The crew decided to start the left hand engine first on battery without assistance by a ground power unit, however, the rpm of the engine did not run up beyond 13%, the battery voltage alarmingly dropped prompting the crew to abort the engine start. In consultation with a ground engineer the crew then decided to try the right hand engine, which started successfully. Afterwards the left engine was successfully started, too. The CAA quoted later testimony by first officer and flight attendant, that the ignition switches were left on the previous day and thus contributed to the start problem. The left hand engine had accumulated 1,714 hours since new, the right hand engine 6,360 hours since new and 3,019 since last overhaul.The first officer was pilot flying for the sector. When the engines of the aircraft accelerated for takeoff, the crew of another aircraft observed thick blue smoke from the right hand engine, engulfing the entire airframe, but feared they could be made responsible if a rejected takeoff failed and therefore did not radio the accident crew to stop. Instead, the observing crew radioed tower asking whether the accident crew would be aware of the smoke. By the time tower called the accident crew reporting heavy smoke, the captain had already called V1 (95 KIAS) and "Rotate" and the takeoff was continued.The CAA reported, that according to CVR and FDR no warning and no caution occurred during the entire takeoff run. The only indication of the catastrophic failure of the right hand engine was the torque indication, that started to drop while the aircraft accelerated through 90 KIAS (about 5 knots below V1 and Vr), with the propeller speed however remaining at nominal speed. The aircraft became airborne at about 125 KIAS. During the climb out the gear was not retracted, the right hand engine's torque reduced further. At 100 feet a number of chimes occurred, the first was called by the first officer as "engine oil contamination". About 5 seconds after the call by the first officer the captain called "we have lost an engine, we are losing an engine" acknowledged by the first officer "I have it, I have it, keeping runway track 6000 feet. Flap is zero. We have lost an engine." The aircraft continued to climb and accelerated to a maximum speed of 145 knots at 185 feet AGL, at which point the right hand engine's torque reduced through 20% and the airspeed began to decay. When the aircraft reached 400 feet AGL the torque had reached zero and the airspeed was reducing through 132 KIAS, the right hand engine's propeller speed began to gradually decrease, the aircraft progressively rolled to the right despite left aileron and left rudder applied.At 490 feet the aircraft temporarily levelled off at an airspeed of 120 KIAS, the first officer commented "We are not maintaining" acknowledged by the captain. A master warning occurred, the beta discrete value of the right hand engine indicated zero. A radion transmission said: "Your gear is still down", the captain was heard on the CVR saying "OK". Shortly thereafter the left engine began to run down, both torque and propeller rpm's dropping to zero consistent with a manual shut down - the investigation later found both power levers in the full forward position (maximum power), the left fuel cut off lever in the cut-off position and the right fuel cut off lever in the flight position.The first officer now called for the gear up, the captain acknowledged, further alerts sounded. The aircraft started to descend, the angle of attack increased and the stick shaker activated. The captain ordered "pitch forward". The SACAA commented that from that point it appeared the captain was flying the aircraft, however, no hand over of controls had been announced or acknowledged. Various ground proximity alerts sounded together with occasional stick shaker activations as the aircraft descended and struck the ground 110 seconds after the start of the takeoff run.The captain sustained blunt chest and lower limb injuries resulting in a multiple organ trauma causing his death 14 days after the accident.The investigation found during a tear down of the engine that the second stage turbine seal plate had failed which was deemed the primary cause of the engine failure. The most damaging effect of the seal plate rim failure was severe imbalance of the turbine rotor. The SACAA continued: "Typically, this vibration led to fatigue failures of the rear bearing oil feed and scavenge pipes with consequent oil starvation and deterioration of the bearing. It is understood that detachment of the bearing cover, tail cone and retention nut had not been seen before, except for one case that occurred in 2009."The investigation determined that the right hand seal plate had failed after 1,314 cycles since new, while the left hand engine's seal plate was worn beyond limits after only 570 hours since new. A Service Bulletin by the manufacturer, issued in 2001 after a number of seal plate rim failures, required inspection of the seal plates every 4,500 hours. The SACAA determined in their investigation that at least 7 seal plate rim failures had occurred before the plate had accumulated 4,500 hours since new between issuance of the Service Bulletin and 2009.The SACAA analysed that the most important cue to the crew during the takeoff run would have been the engine torque indication. The SACAA said: "... had neither of the pilots been monitoring the engine instruments at that point, this cue would have been missed."The engine failure actually occurred when the aircraft accelerated through 90 KIAS. The SACAA analysed that the captain might well have noticed the aircraft swinging to the right but the cause might not have been recognized in the short time between failure and the call to rotate. The SACAA said: "However, considering the experience that both pilots had, this oversight seems surprising."The SACAA said, after rotation an engine failure was correctly identified, the first officer identified oil contamination in the right hand engine, the aircraft was rolling to the right, however, there was no attempt between the pilots to positively identify which engine had failed. The SACAA continued: "There was a gradual loss of control with the captain seemingly attempting to feather the propeller on the failed engine quickly in order to regain control. In doing so, he inadvertently selected the wrong engine. Having done so, a forced landing became inevitable." Later the SACAA stated: "The power reduction of the left engine appears to have been the result of misidentification and shutdown of the engine. This has been verified from analysis of the FDR and CVR information. No clear reason for this misidentification could be established, other than a complete deviation from the operators SOPs."The FDR showed at the time of ground contact the right hand propeller was turning at 65% rpm consistent with not being feathered while the left hand propeller showed no rpm consistent with being feathered. While the right hand propeller appeared to be windmilling just prior to ground impact, impact forces forced the propeller into the reverse blade angle position.Three safety recommendations were issued to the SACAA as result of the investigation.The #2 stage of the turbine and fractured seal plate (Photo: SACAA):Ground tracks after first fuselage contact with ground (Photo: SACAA):Graphical representation of FDR (Graphics: SACAA):
An Air Canada Embraer ERJ-190, registration C-FHKA performing flight AC-1072 from Denver,CO (USA) to Montreal,QC (Canada), had lined up Denver's runway 34R at 13:34L with a delay of 2 hours following substantial snowfall and was cleared for takeoff from runway 34R, when after releasing the brakes but before advancing power levers the crew observed headlights of some vehicle heading towards them on the runway. The crew rejected takeoff and radioed tower, the takeoff clearance was cancelled and the crew was instructed to vacate the runway via taxiway F2.The aircraft departed about 10 minutes later, but needed to divert to Chicago O'Hare,IL (USA). The aircraft departed Chicago about one hour after landing and reached Montreal with a total delay of 4 hours.The NTSB released their factual report erroneously stating the date of occurrence as Dec 31th 2010 (the docket also has the date as Dec 31st 2010, although documents contained in the docket provided by controllers and airport state Jan 31st 2011 as occurrence date, flight AC-1072 did not operate on Dec 31st 2010) reporting, that the Denver Airport Operations Manager was driving his vehicle, callsign OPS6, around the airport overseeing snow removal activity. Control tower had cleared the snow removal team, led by the operations manager, to proceed down taxiway F parallel to runway 34R, the operations manager however had misidentified runway 34R as taxiway F. Once tower became aware of the vehicle on the runway, tower contacted OPS6 and advised a vehicle was on runway 34R. The operations manager did not recognize it was him being on the runway and tried to visually identify the vehicle on the runway before he finally realized he himself was on the runway.The NTSB reported, that Denver Tower was equipped with ground radar and ASDX-E equipment capable to detect conflicts. The equipment however had been configured to not trigger alerts on objects moving at less than 40 knots to avoid nuisance alerts. As the aircraft was still holding position and OPS6 moved at less than 40 knots, ASDE-X did not generate an alert. Playback of ASDE-X showed, that OPS6 entered the runway via taxiway WC at 13:33:40L. The crew radioed about seeing the vehicle at 13:34:40L.A trainee controller supervised by an instructor controller occupied the tower position controlling departures and arrivals on runways 34L and 34R. Both controllers reported when they checked the runway before takeoff clearance the runway appeared to be clear. The trainee controller provided statement, that he scanned both the runway visually and the ASDE-X display, both scans indicating the runway was clear.On Oct 4th 2011 the NTSB released their final report concluding the probable cause was:The driver of the operation vehicle's misidentification of the runway for an adjacent taxiway, resulting in a runway incursion with an aircraft in position for takeoff.Excerpt of Aerodrome Chart (Graphics: FAA):
A Delta Airlines Boeing 737-800, registration N3731T performing flight DL-2809 from Cincinnati,KY to Fort Lauderdale,FL (USA), was cleared to line up Cincinnati's Northern Kentucky Airport runway 18C and wait. The tower controller intended to clear the aircraft for takeoff after a helicopter had crossed the departure path 4nm south of the airport at low level, but lost sight of the helicopter and also could not see the helicopter on his radar display.At the same time a Trans States Embraer ERJ-145, registration N843HK performing flight AX-8069 from Chicago O'Hare,IL to Cincinnati,KY (USA), had been cleared to land and was on short final to Cincinnati's runway 18C.The FAA reported, that once the tower controller had re-acquired visual contact with the helicopter and determined that there was no conflict, the controller cleared the Delta Boeing for takeoff without mention of the arriving traffic although required by operating procedures. The crew of the Trans States Embraer queried whether they should go around reporting they were already inside half of a mile of the runway and the Boeing was still at the approach end of runway 18C. At the same time the Airport Movement Area Safety System (AMASS) issued an alert regarding the developing conflict and the controller instructed the Embraer to go-around on runway heading and climb to 4000 feet. The FAA rated the occurrence a signficant operational error by ATC reporting that the Trans States Embraer overflew the Delta Boeing with the closest proximity being 300 feet vertical.The NTSB released their factual report stating, that on-site investigation and analysis of ATC data revealed no operational error and no loss of separation had occurred. The NTSB confirmed the tower controller was not in compliance with local operating procedures established by the FAA when issuing the takeoff clearance and could have been more definitive with the go-around instructions, however, required separation was established prior to the Embraer crossing the runway threshold.On Oct 4th 2011 the NTSB released their final report concluding the probable cause was:The local controller's distraction with a helicopter south of the field.
A Blue1 Boeing 717-200, registration OH-BLP performing flight KF-866 from Dubrovnik (Croatia) to Helsinki (Finland), rejected takeoff from Dubrovnik at low speed after engine #2 (BR715, right hand) emitted a loud bang and failed.

A Singapore Airlines Airbus A380-800, registration 9V-SKB performing flight SQ-227 from Singapore (Singapore) to Melbourne,VI (Australia) with 401 passengers, was accelerating for takeoff from Singapore's runway 20C when a tyre burst prompting the crew to reject takeoff at low speed. The aircraft slowed safely, emergency services responded. The aircraft was disabled on the runway requiring the runway to be closed until the aircraft could be towed off the runway.Gossip is running that a wheel locked up.The aircraft was able to depart about 7 hours later and reached Melbourne with a delay of 6:40 hours.
An Azul Linhas Aereas Avion de Transport Regional ATR-72-100, registration PR-AZX performing flight AD-4311 from Sao Jose do Rio Preto,SP to Campinas,SP (Brazil) with 67 people on board, rejected takeoff from Sao Jose do Rio Preto at high speed after the captain noticed birds on the runway. The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway.While taxiing to the holding point of the runway for another takeoff attempt the brakes overheated resulting in a brakes fire. Emergency services responded and put the fire out while the aircraft was evacuated causing knee injuries to one passenger.The flight was cancelled, the passengers rebooked onto other flights.
An Air Canada Jazz de Havilland Dash 8-300, registration C-GSTA performing flight QK-8165 from Edmonton,AB to Calgary,AB (Canada) with 38 people on board, was rotating for takeoff from Edmonton's runway 02 when tower observed black smoke from the left hand engine (PW123B) and the left hand propeller went into its feather position uncommandedly. The crew continued the feather procedure, shut the engine down as the aircraft climbed through 1000 feet and returned to Edmonton for a safe landing on Edmonton's runway 30 about 25 minutes later.The Canadian TSB reported that the engine and all propeller related components were removed from the aircraft and are being torn down for inspection. An engineering report will be provided to the TSB.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/JZA165/history/20110919/2230Z/CYEG/CYYC
A Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-500, registration UR-GAK performing flight PS-748 from Nice (France) to Kiev Borispol (Ukraine), was accelerating through 110 KIAS on takeoff from Nice when the crew received a master caution together with a low oil pressure indication for the left hand engine's (CFM56) generator. The aircraft had been dispatched under MEL with the APU inoperative, the commander therefore decided to reject takeoff as there was no backup generator available. The aircraft slowed safely.Ukraine's Ministry of Transport reported maintenance found the oil reservoir contained just minimum oil barely covering the minimum oil marker. The reservoir was refilled to the maximum oil marker and a ground run of the engine showed no problem.
An Aerosvit Antonov An-148-100, registration UR-NTA performing flight VV-307 from Donetsk (Ukraine) to Saint Petersburg (Russia), was accelerating for takeoff when the crew received an asymmetric slat indication. The crew rejected takeoff at low speed (approx 37 kph/20 knots) and returned to the apron.Ukraine's Ministry of Transport reported maintenance identified an unreliable sensor at the right hand slats. The sensor was replaced.
A Farnair Hungary Fokker 27 Friendship, registration HA-FAC performing a positioning flight from Monchengladbach to Cologne (Germany) with 3 crew on board, rejected takeoff from Monchengladbach's runway 31 above V1 and Vr when the aircraft did not rotate despite control inputs. The aircraft overran the damp runway (1200 meters/3930 feet length) by about 55 meters.Germany's BFU released their final report in German reporting, the investigation was concluded after establishing the facts but without conclusions.The aircraft had been flown to Monchengladbach for maintenance. Following the maintenance work the aircraft was to be positioned to Cologne.The captain (59, ATPL, 17,000 hours total, 13,400 hours on type) was pilot monitoring, the first officer (25, CPL, 945 hours total, 585 hours on type) was pilot flying. During flight preparation the captain had decided that 500 kg of ballast had to be loaded into the aft cargo compartment to keep the center of gravity (CG) within permitted range. A subsequent weight and balance sheet computed the CG within permitted range. For the computed takeoff mass of 14,426 kg (MTOW 20,820 kg) the crew computed V1 and Vr at 96 knots and V2 at 101 knots. When the aircraft accelerated through 96 KIAS, the first officer pulled the yoke to initiate rotation, the aircraft however did not respond. The crew therefore rejected takeoff, but could not stop the airplane before the end of the runway. The aircraft came to a stop 55 meters past the runway end on soft ground.The aircraft sustained damage to a nose wheel and tyre due to impact with a concrete base, three approach lights were damaged. The left main tyre's thread was worn down on an area of 15x25 cm (6 by 10 inches).The BFU reported a subsequent inspection of the pitch control system and air speed indicators showed no anomaly, both systems operated normally.The aircraft was weighed. The investigation noticed, that only 282 kg of ballast had been loaded instead of the commanded 500 kg. While verifying the trim and balance sheet the investigation found, that the dry operating weight (11,511 kg) and the dry operating weight index (27) used for the aircraft did not match the real aircraft, that had a dry operating weight of 11,956 kg and an index of 22. A computation of the trim and balance with the corrected values showed, that the center of gravity was forward of the forward limit.HA-FAC past the end of runway 31 (Photo: BFU):
A Virgin America Airbus A319-100, registration N528VA performing flight VX-853 from Dallas Ft. Worth,TX to San Francisco,CA (USA), rejected takeoff from runway 36R at high speed after the aircraft accelerated through a flock of birds and suffered multiple bird strikes. The aircraft slowed safely and vacated the runway via taxiway G8 about mid runway (6500 feet/2000 meters down the runway), the crew requested no assistance.The aircraft was able to depart about 3 hours later and reached San Francisco with a delay of 3:15 hours.A passenger reported the aircraft suffered six bird impacts during the takeoff roll. The airplane came to a safe stop and taxied to the terminal on its own power a few minutes later. An inspection revealed no damage to the aircraft, however both left main gear tyres were replaced. The aircraft subsequently departed without further incident.
A Dniproavia Boeing 737-500 on behalf of Aerosvit, registration UR-DNH performing flight VV-301 from Donetsk (Ukraine) to Moscow Sheremetyevo (Russia), rejected takeoff from Donetsk at high speed (about 101 knots) when the left and right airspeed indicators disagreed. The airplane slowed safely and returned to the apron.Ukraine's Ministry of Transport reported that maintenance found the dynamic port of the first officer's pitot system partially blocked with particles.
A Qantas Boeing 747-400, registration VH-OJI performing flight QF-52 from Singapore (Singapore) to Brisbane,QL (Australia), burst the #7 tyre (outboard aft left body gear tyre) on takeoff from Singapore resulting in substantial damage to the aircraft. The aircraft continued takeoff, dumped fuel and returned to Singapore for a safe landing and vacated the runway onto a taxiway.Wheels #7 and #8 (inboard aft left body wheel) were replaced on the taxiway. The inspection revealed fragments of the tyre had impacted the wing to body fairings, destroyed a body gear electrical harness preventing the left body gear to be retracted, penetrated the body gear main door and left hand inboard flaps, damaged hydraulic lines and completely ripped off the body gear strut door.The aircraft underwent temporary repairs in Singapore, then was ferried to Sydney,NS (Australia) on Aug 22nd (flight QF-6005) without the body gear strut door for further repairs.

The Far East Transport Prosecution office reported that following an engine indication in the cockpit the crew applied emergency brakes.
An American Eagle Embraer ERJ-145, registration N663AR performing flight MQ-4003 from Toronto,ON (Canada) to Chicago O'Hare,IL (USA) with 53 people on board, rejected takeoff from Toronto's runway 05 at low speed when smoke entered the cockpit. The aircraft vacated the runway and stopped on the high speed turn off. Emergency services responded while the passengers were evacuated. Emergency services found no trace of fire or heat.Runway 05 was closed while emergency services responded.The Canadian TSB reported that when the crew advanced throttle levers for takeoff, smoke entered cockpit and cabin. The aircraft taxied clear of the runway and was evacuated. Maintenance found oil in the left hand engine (AE3007). The engine is to be replaced.
A Biman Bangladesh Airbus A310-300, flight BG-1 from Sylhet (Bangladesh) to Dubai (United Arab Emirates) with 171 passengers, rejected takeoff from Sylhet when the aircraft accelerated through a flock of birds and received a number of bird hits. Two left main wheel tyres deflated during deceleration.An inspection revealed one of the engines had ingested a bird and received damage to a number of fan blades.The airline said, two Fokker 28 Fellowships were dispatched from Dhaka to Sylhet to take a maintenance team for repairs of the A313 to Sylhet and to collect the passengers and take them to Dhaka, from where a replacement aircraft flew directly to Dubai.A replacement Airbus A310-300 registration S2-AFT reached Dubai with a delay of 8 hours.The flight's scheduled routing is Dhaka-Sylhet-Dubai-London Heathrow. Besides S2-AFT the airline operates two more A310-300s: S2-ADF and S2-ADK.
An Alrosa Mirny Tupolev TU-154M, registration RA-85728 performing flight 6R-510 from Gelendzik to Tomsk (Russia) with 92 passengers and 7 crew, blew a tyre on takeoff from Gelendzik. The crew decided to continue to Tomsk where the aircraft landed safely with emergency services on stand by.
The Spanish CIAIAC have released their final report in Spanish concluding the probable cause of the crash was:The crew lost control of the aircraft as result of stall immediately after takeoff. The aircraft had not been properly configured for takeoff, following a series of errors and omissions the flaps and slats were not extended. The crew did not identify the stall nor did they take corrective action after takeoff. The crew did not action the relevant checklists thus failing to extend the flaps/slats as result of the "After Engine Start checklist", omitted the flaps/slats cross check in the "Takeoff Briefing Checklist", and failed to confirm the real position of the flaps and slats in the "Takeoff Imminent" checklist. After liftoff a number of warning indications including the stick shaker activated, the multitude of alerts together with the expectation/misperceiption of crew that the takeoff configuration had been applied contributed to the failure of the crew to detect the stall and correct the stall.Contributing factors were:- the absence of the takeoff configuration alert. It could not be conclusively determined why the takeoff configuration warning system failed.- inadequate crew resource management which could not prevent deviation from standard operating procedures due to unscheduled interruptions during flight preparation.The CIAIAC found that weather was not a factor. The crew did not follow the sterile cockpit concept and talked to a third person, thus got distracted from their duties. The crew did work the relevant checklists however executed them not completely, a few points were omitted of some checklists and some actions required by other checklists were not taken. That led to the omission of flap and slat extension as well as missing the cross checks. The checklist "After Engine Start" was interrupted causing the first opportunity to be missed to configure the aircraft properly. The item "Takeoff Briefing" in the "Taxi" checklist was omitted causing the second opportunity to catch the incorrect flap/slat settings to be missed. The third opportunity to catch the incorrect configuration was missed in the "Takeoff Imminent Checklist" that would have required the crew to compare the selector of slats/flaps with their actual positions.The CIAIAC further found that the TakeOff Warning System was required to be operative for the flight, however its operation was required to be tested only before the first flight of the day.33 safety recommendations were made as result of the investigation.
A Delta Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-88, registration N970DL performing flight DL-738 from Atlanta,GA to Hartford,CT (USA), rejected takeoff from Atlanta at high speed after the left hand engine (JT8D) emitted a loud bang and the crew received an engine fire indication. The airplane slowed safely, responding fire fighters foamed the left hand engine. The aircraft was subsequently towed to the apron.The flight was subsequently cancelled, a replacement flight DL-9858 reached Hartford the following morning with a delay of 12 hours.
An Uni Airways McDonnell Douglas MD-90 on behalf of Eva Air, registration B-17918 performing flight BR-807 from Taipei (Taiwan) to Macau (Macao) with 152 passengers and 7 crew, rejected takeoff from Taipei at low speed due to a left hand engine (V2525) fire indication. The airplane slowed safely reaching taxi speed about 200 meters down the runway and began to taxi towards the apron, when smoke was seen from the engine prompting the crew to evacuate the aircraft via slides. 15 people received minor injuries in the evacuation.Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council have dispatched three investigators on site. The black boxes have been removed from the aircraft. A decision whether the ASC or the CAA are going to conduct the investigation is pending.Taiwan's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) reported on Jul 25th that aircraft B-17918 rejected takeoff at 09:19L due to some abnormal indication. The aircraft began to taxi towards the C2 apron when the captain was informed about smoke from the #1 engine, the captain performed a dry start of the engine to clear a possible tail pipe fire however now cabin crew, too, observed smoke from the engine prompting the emergency evacuation. 15 passengers received injuries (mainly abrasions) and were taken to a local hospital. The ASC has determined they will not conduct the investigation, the CAA is investigating.Passengers reported that there had been smell of oil and/or fuel right from boarding throughout taxi to the runway and intensified when the aircraft turned onto the runway and began to accelerate, then the brakes came on very hard.
An Aerosvit Boeing 737-400 on behalf of Dniproavia, registration UR-VVP performing flight Z6-18 from Odessa to Kiev (Ukraine), was accelerating for takeoff from Odessa when just before rotation the aircraft went through a flock of birds suffering a couple of bird hits. The crew continued takeoff and in absence of abnormal indications decided to continue the flight to Kiev, where the aircraft landed safely.Ukraine's Ministry of Transport reported in their July Bulletin in Ukrainian that a postflight inspection found blood and feathers and revealed out of limit damage to the leading edges of 8 fan blades of the right hand engine (CFM56) and damage to the access door for the right hand air conditioning system requiring repairs. The Ministry concluded that the ornithological situation in Odessa had became unfavourable due to a landfill near the aerodrome and insufficient bird control due to management errors (bird control was not listed among the duties of relevant jobs).
A Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747-400, registration G-VTOP performing flight VS-28 from Orlando,FL (USA) to London Gatwick,EN (UK), accelerated through a flock of birds on takeoff from Orlando's runway 17R. The crew continued takeoff and after becoming airborne reported they had run over the top of geese and requested the runway to be inspected. In the absence of abnormal indications the crew continued the flight to London where the aircraft landed safely.The FAA reported the aircraft struck a bird and received "unknown damage".
A Gazpromavia Tupolev TU-154, registration RA-85778 performing flight 4G-9662 from Krasnodar to Yamburg (Russia) with 142 passengers, rejected takeoff from Krasnodar at high speed after a number of left hand main gear tyres burst and smoke briefly emanated from the wheels. The airplane came to a safe stop however remained disabled on the runway with three of the left main gear tyres and wheels damaged. The passengers disembarked onto the runway via mobile stairs.The airport was closed for about 3.5 hours as a result until the aircraft could be towed off the runway.A replacement aircraft is estimated to depart Krasnodar with a delay of 6 hours.
An Air Transat Airbus A330-300, registration C-GTSO performing flight TS-232 from Toronto,ON (Canada) to Dublin (Ireland) with 314 passengers, lost the tread of a left main gear tyre during the takeoff run in Toronto, the tyre damage remained undetected although the tread impacted the underside of the wing. The crew continued the flight to Dublin, where the aircraft performed a seemingly routine and safe landing.The return flight TS-233 was cancelled.The airline reported that a tyre lost its tread ("thrown tread"), which remained undetected until arrival at the gate in Dublin. A panel at the underside of the wing needed to be repaired and a damaged landing gear door needed to be replaced. The aircraft re-entered service on Jul 18th. The 314 passengers waiting for the return flight were accommodated in Dublin and financially compensated for the unusually long delay, a replacement aircraft was dispatched to Dublin.A replacement Airbus A330-300 registration C-GKTS performed the return flight TS-233 and reached Toronto with a delay of 38 hours.The incident aircraft was ferried to Shannon (Ireland) in the early hours of Jul 18th and departed Shannon at 18:00L (17:00Z) positioning to Canada. Aviation sources reported the crew had heard a thud on departure from Toronto and thought it was a bird strike and reported accordingly. Another flight departed from the runway in the meantime before the runway was inspected. The inspection found no birds however tyre debris, the crew of the later departed flight was informed about the tyre debris. In absence of any abnormal indications the crew elected to continue the flight to Dublin, where the damaged tyre was detected. Tyre debris left two punctures through the honey comb material of the aft section of the left wing, one about 2.5 inches/ 6 cm and the other 1.5 inches/ 4 cm in diameter, damage to the left main gear door and impact marks at the wing root and flaps.The Irish AAIU said one investigator was dispatched to Dublin, the investigation, if any, however will be conducted by Canada's Transportation Safety Board.The Canadian TSB reported on Jul 19th that a routine inspection of Toronto's runway 06R spotted a tyre tread and small pieces on the runway between D1 and D3 taxiways. The airport identified Air Transat as one of the operators flights of which had departed from runway 06R earlier the evening. Air Transat identified several flights that had departed from runway 06R and contacted the flight crews to let them know about the found debris, flight 232 however was not identified as one of the possible flights. The flight continued to Dublin for a safe landing. At the gate tyre #1 (left main gear outboard forward tyre) was found deflated and missing its tread, tyres #2 and #5 remained inflated but showed some damage. Secondary damage was found at an under wing panel, the landing gear fixed door and trailing flap.C-GTSO towed at Shannon on Jul 18th 2011:
A Golden Air Avion de Transport Regional ATR-72-500 on behalf of Blue1, registration SE-MDH performing flight DC-607/KF-607 from Helsinki (Finland) to Tallinn (Estonia), rejected takeoff from Helsinki at high speed, slowed safely and returned to the apron.The aircraft was able to depart again about 30 minutes later.A passenger reported that following the rejected takeoff the captain made a quick brief announcement indicating they had a technical problem and were returning to the gate. After arrival at the gate a mechanics entered the cockpit, about 15 minutes later mechanics and captain left the aircraft for a walk around with special attention to the left hand propeller, then the aircraft departed again, this time without rejected takeoff.
An Avianca Airbus A320-200, registration N451AV performing flight AV-39 from Miami,FL (USA) to Cali (Colombia), was accelerating for takeoff when the right hand engine (CFM56) ingested a bird just above V1. The crew continued takeoff, climbed to 5000 feet and reported the right hand engine showed high vibrations. The engine was now running at reduced thrust. The aircraft returned to Miami's runway 09 for a safe landing about 30 minutes after departure.The FAA reported the engine received minor damage.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/AVA39/history/20110716/2121Z/KMIA/SKCL
A Global Air Boeing 737-200, registration XA-TWR performing flight DMJ-6013 from Cancun (Mexico) to San Jose (Costa Rica) with 129 passengers, burst a tyre on takeoff from Cancun. The crew decided to continue the flight to San Jose, where the airplane performed a low approach to have the landing gear inspected from the ground. The aircraft subsequently landed safely with emergency services on stand by.
A Saudi Arabian Airlines Boeing 777-200, flight SV-313 from Riyadh (Saudi Arabia) to Cairo (Egypt) with 296 passengers, burst a nose wheel tyre on takeoff from Riyadh, pieces of rubber were subsequently recovered from the runway. The crew elected to continue the flight to Cairo where the aircraft landed safely with emergency services on stand by.According to the website of Saudi Arabian Airlines the aircraft ferried back to Riyadh without passengers departing Cairo about 1:45 hours past schedule.
An Olympic Air de Havilland Dash 8-400, registration SX-OBC performing flight OA-308 from Sofia (Bulgaria) to Athens (Greece), rejected takeoff at high speed due to a bird strike. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.A replacement Dash 8-400 registration SX-BIT reached Athens with a delay of 4 hours.The incident aircraft was able to ferry to Athens shortly after departure of SX-BIT.
A Jettime Boeing 737-300, registration OY-JTA performing flight JTG-633 from Billund (Denmark) to Ponta Delgada/Azores (Portugal) with 140 passengers, burst a main wheel tyre on takeoff from Billund leaving debris behind on the runway, levelled off at FL070 and returned to Billund for a safe landing.The airline hopes the aircraft will depart again by 12:00L with a delay of 5 hours following replacement of the tyre.
A Lufthansa Boeing 747-400, registration D-ABTL performing flight LH-686 from Frankfurt/Main (Germany) to Tel Aviv (Israel), rejected takeoff from Frankfurt's runway 18 at high speed due to unusual vibrations from the nose gear. The airplane slowed safely and stopped in the last third of the runway (4000 meters/13120 feet long) for about 5 minutes before vacating the runway. After emergency services cooled the brakes the airplane returned to the apron.A replacement Boeing 747-400 registration D-ABVD reached Tel Aviv with a delay of 8 hours.A passenger in the aft cabin reported the airplane accelerated normally with no anomalies noticed when the brakes were applied at high speed and the airplane slowed rapidly coming to a stop in the last quarter of the runway. The captain announced that they rejected takeoff due to inexplicable vibrations from the nose gear. The airplane returned to a remote stand on the apron, where it became clear that another aircraft needed to do the flight. The crew explained that the left outboard thrust reverser (engine CF6) had a defect, too. The departure of the replacement 747 got delayed by passengers wanting to get off the flight and by a reported closure of Tel Aviv Airport for 3 hours. After departure from runway 18 the captain remarked D-ABTL had left impressive skid marks on the runway.
A Thai Airways Boeing 747-400, registration HS-TGP performing flight TG-911 from London Heathrow,EN (UK) to Bangkok (Thailand), burst a nose wheel tyre on takeoff from Heathrow's runway 27L. The crew decided to continue the flight to Bangkok, where the aircraft landed safely.Heathrow's southern runway was closed for about 40 minutes to collect the debris, numerous rubber and metal pieces, from the runway.A passenger reported that they did not notice anything unusual during the takeoff run, no announcements were made and they remained unaware of the events. After landing they did notice fire engines waiting on the taxiways along the runway but did not think they were waiting for their aircraft, that vacated the runway and then stopped for a while before continuing to the apron.
A Safair Boeing 737-300, registration ZS-SMG performing a cargo flight from Johannesburg to Cape Town (South Africa) with 2 crew, lost the #1 (outboard left hand) main wheel during takeoff from Johannesburg without the crew noticing the event. The flight continued to Cape Town for a safe landing where ground crew made the flight crew aware of the missing wheel. The wheel was later recovered by ground staff cutting grass at Johannesburg.South Africa's Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) released their final report concluding the probable cause was:The outer main wheel bearing failed, causing the wheel assembly to depart from the axle. The disintegration of the bearing produced shards, which pierced the left flap.Contributing factor: incorrect bearing fitted to the wheel assembly.The SACAA reported that after landing not only the outboard left main wheel was missing, but the left hand inboard trailing flaps also showed two 1cm wide holes that were caused by shards from the wheel assembly.The SACAA found that wheel bearing part number 596 had been installed instead of the correct bearing part number 598, the two bearings had a difference of 8 mm. The SACAA analysed that the wheel bearing was fitted by an unskilled worker stating: "It was possible that under these conditions (lack of technical knowledge), the part number could have been overlooked as the numerals (596 and 598) were similar in appearance. It is also possible that due to lack of knowledge, the assembly manuals could have been overlooked during the process."Maintenance procedures were changed as result of the incident.The wheel axle after landing (Photo: SACAA):
A Blue1 Avro RJ-85, registration OH-SAR performing flight KF-639 from Helsinki (Finland) to Copenhagen (Denmark) with 93 passengers and 4 crew, was accelerating through about 100 knots for takeoff from Helsinki's runway 22R when the outboard left hand engine (LF507) failed prompting the crew to reject takeoff. The aircraft vacated the runway, a runway inspection on request by tower found no obstacles. Two other aircraft had already been cleared for takeoff from that runway when the captain phoned the tower reporting the severe nature of the engine failure and recommended to perform another runway inspection, that found a significant number of engine pieces on the runway. The crews of the two departed aircraft were informed via Tallinn (Estonia) ATC, but had not received any damage.Finland's Onnettomuustutkintakeskus (Accident Investigation Board AIBF) released their final report concluding:A serious incident developed because two transport aircraft were cleared for take-off while there were engine pieces on the runway, which could have damaged the aircraft during take-off run. The engine pieces remained on the runway, since they were not found in the first runway inspection carried out after the aborted take-off.The first runway inspection failed partly because any detailed assessment about the nature and location of the incident was not given in conjunction with the inspection request, and the airport maintenance unit therefore did not see any specific reason to inspect the runway more thoroughly than usual. The ATC actions when asking for runway inspection and providing related information to the airport maintenance unit were in accordance with the instructions and established practices at the aerodrome.The AIBF reported, that immediately after the crew had rejected takeoff and vacated the runway the tower requested a runway inspection. The Blue1 captain also recommended a runway inspection. A vehicle with an experienced airport worker was dispatched and drove along the runway and taxiway, the RJ-85 had vacated the runway at, but did not see any obstacles during the three minute long runway inspection and reported the runway clear. Subsequently two transport category aircraft were cleared for takeoff from runway 22R.After the Avro had reached the stand and the passengers had disembarked, the captain took a look at the engine together with Blue1 technical staff. This first inspection found the inlet area and compressor was intact with no evidence of any foreign object ingestion, however, the engine's low pressure turbine had seized and the hot section had received substantial damage, chips were found in the bearings.The captain subsequently phoned the tower reporting there were pieces missing from the engine and recommended a second runway inspection. The same vehicle, with the same driver, was dispatched for the second runway inspection, this time with more detailed information about the nature of the event. The supervisor decided on his own initiative to join the runway inspection and drove to the runway with a second vehicle. A significant number of engine pieces were subsequently found on the runway, partly melted into the runway surface though removable by hand. The small pieces had about the same colour as the runway surface, were hard to see and were best spotted in a walking runway inspection.The pieces were spread over a length of 400 meters along the runway. Several pieces were found about 5 meters left of the runway center line, the most outward pieces were found left off the runway. About 50 pieces, 2mm (0.1 inch) to 40mm (1.6 inches) in size, were recovered from the runway surface. The runway region was subsequently swept, the runway was closed for about 3.5 hours as a result.The engine was sent to the manufacturer for further examination. The low pressure turbine stage 2 blades had suffered fatigue cracks and caused massive overload damage in the third and fourth stage also damaging bearing #4. Evidence suggested the engine had operated with an abnormal fuel manifold spray pattern probably caused by carbon residue in the nozzle.The AIBF analysed that it had been detected the engine was running about 10 degrees hotter than anticipated, however the temperature was well within acceptable tolerance. During the last maintenance the engine shop performed a hot running procedure, the compressor was washed, some leak tests performed and some seals replaced. At no point it was foreseeable however that the engine was going to be damaged.The crew acted properly and swiftly in good cooperation. The commander's decisions were logical and showed excellent control of the situation as a whole. The captain decided to discharge one fire bottle into the engine because of the high temperature indication albeit without a fire indication, a measure that "must be considered as a good precaution".Due to the captain's prompt reaction and report to tower only two aircraft were permitted to takeoff over the debris. There were no established procedures to inform ATC about this kind of findings.The AIBF further analysed that the tower controller requested a normal procedures runway inspection at first, without specifiying the area to be searched or giving any indication on what to expect to be found. In that respect he was strictly following standard operating procedures. As result one car with one driver was dispatched and did not focus on a specific area of the runway.After receiving information from the captain the tower controller requested a second runway inspection now providing information about what to expect and about where. Two cars were used and much more time was used for the runway inspection, that found small engine pieces on the runway with about the same colour as the runway surface.The engine exhaust (Photo: AIBF):The fatigue cracks LPT stage 2 blades (Photo: AIBF):The pieces found on the runway over the background runway surface (Photo: AIBF):Area A (debris area) and trajectory of aircraft (Photo: AIBF):
A Korean Air Cargo Boeing 747-400, registration HL-7602 performing flight KE-8594 from Copenhagen (Denmark) to Seoul (South Korea), rejected takeoff from Copenhagen's runway 22R reporting an open door indication, stopped on the runway and requested fire trucks to check the hot brakes reporting all main gear brakes indicated hot.The runway was blocked for about 15 minutes.The aircraft departed about 3:20 hours after rejecting the first takeoff.
A LOT Polish Airlines Embraer ERJ-175, registration SP-LIF performing flight LO-768 from Odessa (Ukraine) to Warsaw (Poland), rejected takeoff from Odessa at low speed after the crew received a takeoff configuration alert. The airplane returned to the apron.Ukraine's Ministry of Transport reported the onboard computers were rebooted and the airplane departed again.The aircraft reached Warsaw with a delay of 3 hours.
A Khors Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-83 on behalf of Sahand Airlines, registration UR-CJE performing flight IRS-5816 from Tehran Mehrabad to Ahwaz (Iran), was climbing through 5200 feet out of Tehran, the crew was just reducing takeoff to climb thrust, when the right hand engine (JT8D) emitted a loud bang, the crew identifying the right hand engine was surging followed by a substantial increase in EGT and a substantial decrease in N1 and N2 indications. The crew secured the engine and returned to Tehran for a safe landing.Ukraine's Ministry of Transport - overseeing Khors Airlines - reported, that the engine sustained substantial internal damage causing the engine to surge. An investigation to determine the cause of the internal damage has been initiated.
A Delta Airlines Boeing 737-800, registration N382DA performing flight DL-1716 from Denver,CO to Atlanta,GA (USA) with 159 passengers and 6 crew, blew two tyres on takeoff from Denver. The crew elected to continue to Atlanta where the airplane landed safely with emergency services on stand by. The aircraft stopped on the runway, the tyres were replaced, the aircraft subsequently taxied to the gate where passengers disembarked.
The Dutch Onderzoeksraad (Dutch Safety Board DSB) released their final report concluding:During the takeoff at Eindhoven airport the pilot flying perceived two control issues and one speed trend vector anomaly.- The explanation for the control issues and speed trend vector anomaly was likely related to an outside atmospheric phenomenon. The origin of this atmospheric phenomenon could not be determined or explained with the information available. The takeoff was rejected after the decision speed V1 and while the nose wheel was off the ground for approximately two seconds.- The First Officer who was the pilot flying considered the control and speed trend vector problems to be serious enough and decided to reject the takeoff.- According to company procedures only the Captain is authorized to make a rejected takeoff decision.- To reject a takeoff above V1, especially when the nose wheel is off the ground, is in principle considered to be improper and unsafe. There is no specific guidance from the operator or manufacturer on dealing with control issues at the time of rotating the aircraft.- Specific guidance on rejecting a takeoff exist in case of an engine failure.- Review of past statistics and studies show that pilot training and requirements focus on rejected takeoffs due to an engine failure. Studies and statistical information show that this accounts for less than 25% of the reasons for rejected takeoffs. Thus 75% of the reasons the reject a takeoff is not trained for.The first officer (2300 hours total, 1170 hours on type) was pilot flying for the leg from Eindhoven to Faro, the captain (3628 hours total, 2061 hours on type) was pilot monitoring.The airplane taxied for a full length departure from runway 04 entering the runway at taxiway G. While the aircraft accelerated at low speed the first officer reported difficulties to keep the aircraft on the runway centerline. At 80 knots the airspeed indications were cross checked satisfactorily. While accelerating through about 90 knots the airplane again deviated from the center line, the captain checked the engine instruments believing they might have an engine asymmetry but found both engines operating symmetrically and correctly.Accelerating through about 140 knots the first officer noticed a speed trend vector in the negative direction while the captain's instrument showed a positive speed trend vector. The captain did not find this discrepancy an issue. The V1 and Vr calls were made at the proper speeds and the captain removed his hand from the thrust levers.The first officer reported later that upon reaching V1 the control column moved aft without application of force, the aircraft began to rotate on its own, the nose gear lifted off the runway. He had the feeling the airplane was unsafe to fly and therefore closed the throttle levers, the autobrakes system engaged automatically and the spoilers deployed automatically. The nose gear was airborne for about 2 seconds.As soon as the takeoff was rejected the captain took control of the aircraft for the roll out. The airplane came to a stop about 500 meters before the runway end. Flaps were kept at 5 degrees, the captain deemed an evacuation was not necessary. The tower was informed that no assistance was necessary and taxied towards the apron. A master caution related the center fuel pump illuminated, the crew subsequently requested tower to check whether "everything is fine with the rubber" and later "check our wheels are fine". As result of the rejected takeoff the brake temperature indications increased, the crew became concerned with overheated brakes and possible wheel fire. After arriving at the stand smoke was observed from the brakes. The crew decided to have the passengers disembark and let the brakes cool off.The DSB reported that the cockpit voice recorder was not available for the investigation. The flight data recorder showed after application of takeoff thrust the airplane showed variations in magnetic heading between 0 and 50 knots, the deviations were countered with the rudder. At around 60 knots the aircraft became stable on runway heading. Between 100 and 150 knots the flight data recorder showed fluctuations in the recorded airspeeds, at 135 KIAS the airspeeds jumps by 10 knots in just one second. 21 seconds after accelerating through 80 KIAS the pitch increased to a maximum of 1.4 degrees nose up, the nose gear was off the runway for nearly 2 seconds. Simultaneously a left -0.126G and right 0.093G acceleration is recorded. The airspeed reached a maximum of 160 KIAS, the thrust levers were retarded at 152 KIAS.Maintenance focussed on the report of unreliable airspeed first, a test confirmed a disagreement of airspeeds between left and right side. According to the fault isolation manual the right hand angle of attack sensor needed adjustment, subsequently the test showed no discrepancy between left and right hand side anymore.During further maintenance activities a dent beyond limits was discovered in the left pitot probe, the probe was subsequently replaced. Maintenance further replaced the alpha vane, pitot probe and Air Data Inertial Reference Unit on the right hand side.The DSB analysed that the cause of the heading variations during the initial takeoff roll could not clarified due to the FDR not recording the steering tiller position. The DSB believes the changes in aircraft heading could be related to overcontrolling the aircraft or an external disturbance like a wake turbulence (unlikely), gusting winds (no gusts reported) or turbulence due to structures (unlikely due to distances).Above 110 KIAS the speed trend vectors had discrepancies. The recorded airspeeds (captain's side only) show that although the acceleration was smooth the recorded airspeed values in contract showed sharp increases and decreases, which likely resulted in the observed speed trend vectors. The angle of attack sensors showed disagreement as well indicating the airflow was turbulent with the airflow being asymmetric between left and right hand side.At the time of accelerating through V1 no forces were applied to the control column and the control column did not move. In a flight control check during taxi no anomalies had been noted, there was no difference in the control column positions and movements to previous flights. It is possible the aircraft rotated on its own due to improper weight and balance resulting in a center of gravity off computed range and the trim being out of range. However, both center of gravity and trim setting were correct.When the control column was moved aft in order to rotate the aircraft large lateral acceleration occurred changing the heading of the aircraft. Rudder pedals were used to align the aircraft back onto the runway centerline. The large lateral accelerations may have induced a feeling (tactile input) to the first officer giving him the impression the aircraft was unsafe to fly.Graphical representation of FDR (Graphics: DSB):
A Dragonair Airbus A320-200, registration B-HSE performing flight KA-877 from Shanghai to Hong Kong (China), returned to Shanghai after the yellow and green hydraulic systems failed shortly after takeoff. The airplane landed safely without nose gear steering, stopped on the runway and needed to be towed to the apron.
A Jetblue Embraer ERJ-190, registration N179JB performing flight B6-914 from Chicago O'Hare,IL to New York JFK,NY (USA), was accelerating through about 90 knots on O'Hare's runway 32R when a bird struck the aircraft near the nose prompting the crew to reject takeoff. The aircraft slowed safely and returned to the apron.A replacement Embraer ERJ-190 reached New York with a delay of 3 hours.
An Emirates Boeing 777-200, registration A6-EWD performing flight EK-213 from Dubai (United Arab Emirates) to Houston,TX (USA), rejected takeoff from Dubai's runway 30R (length 4000 meters/13200 feet) at high speed after the left nose gear tyre burst. During deceleration the right nose gear tyre burst as well due to the resulting load. The airplane came to a stop about 2000 feet short of the runway end, responding emergency services needed to cool down the overheated and smoking brakes.The runway was closed until the aircraft could be towed off the runway.A replacement Boeing 777-200 registration A6-EWF resumed the flight departing Dubai with a delay of 8 hours and reached Houston with a delay of 6 hours.The incident aircraft has not yet reentered service (standing Jun 10th 08:00Z).
A Delta Airlines Boeing 767-400, registration N839MH performing flight DL-30 from New York JFK,NY (USA) to Moscow Sheremetyevo (Russia), was cleared for takeoff from New York's runway 22R, when the crew of another Delta aircraft lining up for departure called "Abort! Abort!" reporting a flat right hand main gear rear outboard tyre. Tower cancelled the takeoff clearance, the crew rejected takeoff at low speed and vacated the runway via taxiway F (about 2000 feet from the starting point but still ahead of the displaced runway threshold). The aircraft subsequently returned to the apron.The airplane was able to depart about 2.5 hours later and reached Moscow with a delay of 2 hours.
An American Airlines Boeing 777-200, registration N782AN performing flight AA-187 from Chicago O'Hare,IL (USA) to Beijing (China) with 249 people on board, was climbing out of O'Hare's runway 10 when the crew reported they suspected to have blown a tyre during takeoff and requested a runway inspection. After contacting departure control the crew reported, that they believed to have blown a tyre and now were dealing with multiple hydraulic problems. The aircraft levelled off at 6000 feet and entered a holding to trouble shoot the issues, the crew reporting they had to expect slow flap and slat operation and impaired gear operation. Tower reported that a lot of rubber including one large piece was found on the runway but no hydraulic fluid. The airplane subsequently flew over Lake Michigan to dump fuel. On approach to runway 10 the crew reported they had lost the right main gear inboard rear tyre and performed a safe landing on runway 10 about one hour after departure.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/AAL187/history/20110606/0200Z/KORD/ZBAA
A Turkmenistan Airlines Boeing 737-700, registration EZ-A008 performing flight T5-732 from Saint Petersburg (Russia) to Ashgabat (Turkmenistan) with 120 people on board, rejected takeoff from Saint Petersburg at low speed when the left hand engine's (CFM56) parameters did not match expectations during engine acceleration. The airplane returned to the apron.Passengers reported the crew announced the engine probably ingested some foreign object.The airline said, the cause of the engine trouble is under investigation.A replacement aircraft has been dispatched to Saint Petersburg and is estimated to depart with a delay of 13 hours.
A Delta Airlines Boeing 767-300, registration N195DN performing flight DL-257 from Detroit,MI (USA) to Sao Paulo Guarulhos,SP (Brazil), blew the aft inboard right hand main gear tyre on takeoff from Detroit's runway 21L while rotating for takeoff, the crew retracted the gear normally, continued to Sao Paulo, declared emergency on approach due to a possibly blown tyre and landed safely.The return flight DL-256 was cancelled.Delta Airlines said the crew was aware of tyre debris being found on the runway following their departure, Delta technicians however were unable to positively identify from photos whether the debris belonged to a Delta aircraft or not. The crew therefore declared emergency on approach to Sao Paulo as a precaution.Takeoff run (Video: tengoindiamike)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_66mlsFwB9I
An Airphilexpress Airbus A320-200, flight 2P-988 from Davao to Manila (Philippines) with 176 passengers, was lined up and waiting for takeoff clearance from Davao's runway 23 when an unknown voice was heard on radio (by both crew and tower) warning that there was a bomb on board of the aircraft. The aircraft returned to the apron where passengers disembarked.Police reported a search of the aircraft, passengers and luggage found no trace of explosives or incendiary device.The aircraft departed with a delay of 5 hours.
An Air Baltic Fokker 50, registration YL-BAR performing flight BT-361 from Riga (Latvia) to Tallinn (Estonia), rejected takeoff from Riga's runway 18 at low speed when the crew did not receive expected engine indications. The aircraft returned to the apron, but was able to depart about 35 minutes later and reached Tallinn with a delay of about 30 minutes.
The Taiwanese Aviation Safety Council (ASC) released their final report in Chinese concluding the probable causes of the accident were:- The captain entered the estimated landing weight as takeoff weight into the Runway Analysis System (RAS). This resulted in the RAS computing false takeoff thrust data and false V1, Vr and V2 speeds. The first officer did not cross check the gross weight data entered into the RAS.- The first officer entered the results of RAS into his control display unit (CDU) which caused the flight management system to reject the takeoff speeds and instead display "---" for V1, Vr and V2.- The second officer cross checked the reference speed data during taxi, however used the gross weight data displayed by the FMS instead of the load sheet or computer flight plan.- When rotation commenced at the computed 149 KIAS (instead of the correct 166 KIAS), the wings did not produce sufficient lift to become airborne at normal angles of attack, the angle of attack therefore increased further until the tail of the aircraft struck the runway.Findings to Risk- the pilots may not have fully understood China Airlines' operating manuals relating to RAS input and cross checks.- China Airlines' operating manuals did not contain detailed procedures to enter and cross check takeoff data.- After takeoff the crew discussed the possibility of a tail strike but without a tail strike indication and in fear of being questioned by the operator the crew agreed to continue to Taipei at FL320 instead of planned FL360 with increased monitoring of cabin pressurization and reviewed procedures in case of a possible loss of cabin pressure.- The crew duty and rest times were in compliance with law requirements however captain and second officer may have been subjected to degraded performance by fatigue symptoms.- Crew communication, interaction, decision making, recognition of fatigue symptoms as well as other skills of crew resource management need improvement.- the tail section of the aircraft suffered from compression stress. The affected skin at the underside of the tail was at risk of overload due to toroidal stress as result of the abrasions.The captain (45, ATPL, 12,773 hours total, 9,957 hours on type) occupied the left hand seat and assumed the duties of pilot flying, the first officer (38, ATPL, 5,720 hours total, 3,927 hours on type) occupied the right hand seat and assumed the duties of pilot monitoring, the second officer (28, CPL, 3,208 hours total, 877 hours on type) occupied the observer seat. The crew prepared for a takeoff from Anchorage's runway 25L with flaps at 10 degrees. The computer flight plan, based on the load sheet, showed a takeoff weight of 827,311 lbs (375,600 kg) and an estimated landing weight of 596,741 lbs (270,920 kg). To compute the takeoff performance data the crew decided to use the Runway Analysis System (RAS) via ACARS, the captain erroneously entered 597,000 lbs into the takeoff weight entry for RAS instead of 827,000 lbs. The RAS computed a balanced takeoff performance of an assumed outside temperature of 57 degrees C, V1 was computed at 141 knots, Vr at 149 knots and V2 at 155 knots, while the correct data would have been V1 at 151 knots, Vr at 166 knots and V2 at 177 KIAS.The first officer entered the results of the RAS into his CDU, but the takeoff speeds were shown as "---" thereafter. The crew could not explain why, the captain pulled the circuit breaker for the FMS to reset the FMS, but the behaviour remained the same and the crew still could not explain why. The captain instructed the second officer to look for the relevant section of the operation manuals, but nothing could be found. In consultation all three crew agreed to enter the takeoff speed data produced by the RAS into the relevant FMS fields. During taxi the captain instructed the second officer to compute the takeoff speeds from the takeoff performance table in the manual. The second officer read the takeoff weight (which actually was the estimated landing weight) off the CDU, used the performance table for flaps 20 (in lack of tables present for flaps 10) and found the reference speeds entered into the FMS were not far off the tables. The captain therefore decided the results of RAS were in reasonable range, continued taxi and commenced takeoff.The captain initiated rotation at 149 KIAS, 8 seconds later the nose wheel lifted off the runway, another 5 seconds later the stick shaker activated prompting the captain to release yoke pressure and push the throttle levers fully forward causing the engines to accelerate from 90% N1 to 104% N1, the stick shaker operated for 5 seconds stopping when the airplane climbed through 38 feet radar altitude at a speed of 169 KIAS. The first officer later said, that he believed the stick shaker activated as result of a wind shear.The aircraft climbed out reaching 1476 feet AGL still below 177 KIAS (correct V2) and then accelerated. The ASC analysed that had an engine failure occurred during that time the airplane would possibly have been out of control.During climb out the crew discussed the possibility of a tail strike and requested a runway inspection, that did not find any traces on the runway surface. The crew checked the cabin pressure instruments and engine instruments without detecting any anomaly. At FL280 the crew verified the cabin pressure could be maintained. The crew decided to continue the flight to Taipei however remain at FL320 - after verifying they had sufficient fuel to continue at the lower flightlevel - instead of the planned FL360 being in fear they would face serious queries and consequences by their superiors if they returned to Anchorage with a perfectly normal aircraft.Following the safe landing at Taipei friction marks were discovered at the belly of the aircraft.The aircraft received damage to the belly skin past the pressure vessel, the abrasions perforating the skin. The cabin pressure outflow valve was worn and torn, the fuselage section past the pressure vessel received damage to its structure and components requiring the replacement of structural parts.Abrasion Damage (Photo: ASC):ACARS Runway Analysis System (Photo: ASC):Computer Flight Plan (Photo: ASC):Flight Data Recorder (Graphics: ASC):Map (Graphics: ASC):
An Aegean Airbus A321-200, registration SX-DGA performing flight A3-618 from Athens (Greece) to Paris Charles de Gaulle (France) with 182 passengers, reported a bird strike upon takeoff from Athen's runway 03R but continued the climb. At FL160 the crew levelled off reporting an unusual sound, subsequently decided to return to Athens after burning off some fuel to get below maximum landing weight and landed safely on runway 03R about 55 minutes after departure.A replacement Airbus A321-200 registration SX-DVO reached Paris with a delay of 3 hours.
A Lufthansa Cityline Embraer ERJ-190, registration D-AECB performing flight LH-1261 from Graz (Austria) to Frankfurt/Main (Germany), rejected takeoff from Graz after the right hand engine (CF34) ingested a bird. The airplane slowed safely and returned to the apron.The runway was closed for about 10 minutes.The flight was cancelled, the passengers were rebooked onto the next flights.
A Qantas Boeing 747-400, registration VH-OJL performing flight QF-1 from Bangkok (Thailand) to London Heathrow,EN (UK) with 308 passengers, returned to Bangkok shortly after takeoff after the crew decided to shut an engine (RB211) down. The airplane landed in Bangkok safely about 2 hours after departure.The airline said shortly after takeoff there was an increase in vibration and high temperature from one of the four engines so the pilots shut this engine down and returned to Bangkok as a precaution.
A BMI British Midland Embraer ERJ-145, registration G-RJXC performing flight BD-678 from London Heathrow,EN (UK) to Aberdeen,SC (UK) with 43 people on board, rejected takeoff at high speed due to a brakes malfunction and a burst tyre. The airplane slowed safely coming to a stand still with the left inboard main gear tyre blown. A replacement aircraft registration G-RJXH reached Aberdeen with a delay of 1:50 hours.
A Dniproavia Embraer ERJ-145, registration UR-DNA performing flight Z6-4 from Dnepropetrovsk to Kiev (Ukraine), rejected takeoff at low speed (approx. 57 KIAS) when the left hand engine (Ae3007) showed a low N1 reading. The airplane slowed safely and returned to the apron.Ukraine's Ministry of Transport reported that the engine failed as result of insufficient fuel supply due to the failure of the fuel pump metering unit (FPMU). The FPMU was replaced and the faulty device sent to the manufacturer for further analysis.
A Jetblue Airbus A320-200, flight B6-757 from New York JFK,NY (USA) to Aruba (Aruba) with 104 passengers and 5 crew, struck a bird on takeoff from John F. Kennedy's runway 04L, the crew reporting "positive impact". The crew levelled off at 5000 feet to analyse the airplane status and subsequently decided to return to JFK for a VOR approach to runway 13R, declared emergency reporting the bird struck the right engine, they expected a normal landing however. The aircraft landed safely on runway 13R about 30 minutes after departure.A replacement Airbus A320-200 reached Aruba with a delay of 3 hours.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/JBU757/history/20110514/1529Z/KJFK/TNCA
A Lufthansa Cityline Canadair CRJ-900, registration D-ACKA performing flight CL-2364/LH-2364 from Munich (Germany) to Zurich (Switzerland), was cleared for takeoff from runway 08R in clear skies (visibility above 10km) with the information of two helicopters departing between Munich's two runways but subsequently rejected takeoff at about 80 knots when the crew observed the two helicopters in the vicinity of runway 08R. The aircraft taxied back and departed a few minutes later reaching Zurich with a delay of one minute.The German BFU have released their bulletin in German reporting that the CRJ was cleared for takeoff from runway 08R with the additional information: "Information, two helicopters are departing between the runways." The crew acknowledged and about 30 seconds later began the takeoff roll.Immediately after the CRJ was cleared for takeoff, the formation of two US Military transport helicopters was cleared for takeoff for a VFR flight from Munich to Garmisch (Germany) with the instruction: "Fly initially inbound the tower, report departing Canadair in sight" which was acknowledged: "[ ] towards the tower, we´ll report."The helicopters initially tracked eastbound, then turned south onto a westerly heading. The commander had not assumed that tower wanted them indeed to directly fly towards the tower which would cause problems to aircraft parked below due to the low altitude and the prop wash of the helicopters. While in the turn the commander reported the departing Canadair in sight and was again instructed to not cross the runway. The formation therefore continued to track westbound between taxiways S and T, about 200 meters north of the runway waiting for clearance to cross runway 08R.About 8 seconds after the helicopters finished the turn onto the westerly heading parallel to runway 08R the CRJ crew rejected takeoff and vacated the runway via taxiway B10. The helicopters were subsequently cleared to cross runway 08R and exited the control zone. The formation leading pilot (FAA helicopter license) had 1,800 hours and the pilot of the second helicopter 1,200 hours total flying experience.The investigation was terminated with depiction of facts but without conclusions.Flight path of helicopter formation (Graphics: BFU):
A Kam Air Douglas DC-8-60, registration YA-VIC performing a cargo flight from Manston,EN (UK) to Buenos Aires,BA (Argentina) via Cape Verde Islands with 3 crew and 9 passengers, struck its tail onto Manston's runway 28 during takeoff. The crew continued to Cape Verde Islands where evidence of the tail bumper contacting ground was discovered.Inspection revealed the energency absorber had received deformation which however had remained within limits, no further inspection was required, and the airplane continued the flight to Buenos Aires.The United Kingdom's Air Accident Investigation Branch released their Bulletin reporting, that Kam Air had acquired two DC-8s from an operator in the United Arab Emirates. The flight from Manston to Buenos Aires carrying 36 polo ponies. For the flight the aircraft was carrying two complete crews.The flight engineer determined the cargo weight at 43,409 lbs, the aircraft carried 143,700 lbs of fuel - despite the computed minimum fuel required to Cape Verde being 97,661 lbs including a diversion - bringing the aircraft's takeoff weight to 343,346 lbs. The flight engineer entered a maximum takeoff weight of 349,000 lbs into the load sheet, however it was unclear how he arrived at that figure, the actual structural maximum takeoff weight is 358,000 lbs. The center of gravity was computed at 22.8 percent MAC which is about in the middle of the permitted range. Using the load sheet V1 was computed at 143 KIAS, Vr at 160 KIAS and V2 at 172 KIAS.The performance table for Manston's runway 28 provided a takeoff weight limit of 317,300 lbs for the selected takeoff flap setting, thus the aircraft was 25,700 lbs (11,670 kg) over weight for takeoff from Manston's runway 28. The use of flap 23 would have increased the weight limit by 10,600 lbs. The flight engineer however did not refer to the runway performance tables.The captain (55, ATPL, 15,000 hours total, 3,000 on type) was pilot flying for the sector, the runway was dry, temperature at 20 degrees C, winds came from 290 degrees magnetic at 7 knots.A number of airport staff including loaders, air traffic controllers and operations staff commented that the airplane appeared to be slow on acceleration. The aircraft rotated near the runway end, a cloud of debris was thrown up as the aircraft climbed away.The captain later reported he was aware of two jolts as the aircraft lifted off and suspected a tail strike had occurred. Subsequent inspection showed the aircraft had left a scrape mark on the runway that extended beyond the runway end onto soft ground. Manston's Air Traffic Control suspected a tail strike and relayed the info to the crew via London ATC. With all aircraft systems appearing normal the captain decided to continue the flight to Cape Verde, where the tail strike was confirmed.Scrape marks began 35 meters before the runway end (runway's takeoff distance available 3112 meters) over the next 24.6 meters, followed by a 23,8 meters long gap which however contained a destroyed center line lighting fitting, and continued as an up to 23cm deep trench in soft soil, the total length of the ground marks was 117.5 meters. The marks were consistent with the contact of a sole plate of the tail skid assembly. The center line light fitting was destroyed by contact with the right hand main gear.The flight data recorder showed that rotation began at 159 KIAS consistent with the 160 KIAS target. The aircraft reached 8 degrees nose up pitch in the next 5 seconds and continued to increase at a constant rate until 11 degrees where a marked reducting in pitch rate occurred. A significant aft control input was made at that time after which the pitch continued to increase to a maximum of 15.2 degrees nose up. The AOM indicates tail strike would occur at 8.95 degrees nose up leading the conclusion, that the airplane had already just become airborne when the tailstrike occurred at 11 degrees nose up.The AAIB analysed that the computer generated flight plans showed less fuel than actually necessary. The predictions by the computer flight plans were about 19% less than the actual fuel burn. The crew however increased the fuel amount by 47% which seems excessive.The UK Government's Department of Transport decided upon receiving the AAIB report as well as information from a number of other sources that Kam Air would receive no further operating permits on UK soil for its DC-8 fleet and notified the European Union. Following ramp checks and the information from the UK government the European Union decided to put Kam Air onto the list of operators which are prohibited from operating in the European Union (published by Nov 23rd 2010). ICAO reported that due to the travel restrictions imposed by the United Nations it had not been possible to perform an audit of Afghanistan's state aviation regulatory structure.Four safety recommendations dealing with the audit of state regulatory bodies, where audit by ICAO can not be assured, have been released as result of the investigation.
An Air Nostrum Canadair CRJ-200 on behalf of Iberia, registration EC-HHV performing flight YW-8781/IB-8781 from Nice (France) to Barcelona,SP (Spain), rejected takeoff from Nice's runway 04R at low speed in night conditions when the crew spotted another aircraft, a Raytheon, on the runway ahead of them. The aircraft stopped safely after about 150 meters of roll.The French BEA have released their final report concluding the probable cause of the serious incident was:inadvertent crossing of holding point A3 without the Raytheon crew nor tower controller detecting the error.Contributing factors- the aerodrome chart was not in agreement with reality concerning the intersection of taxiways V and W.- the taxiway lighting A3 which probably attracted the attention of the crew- the taxiway lighting V which could mislead crews searching for the intersection with taxiway W- taxiway marking W which was not visible from the intersection- the complexity of the area between runway 04L and 04R with intersections of multiple wide taxiways- low cockpit height of the Raytheon- transition between bright lights and light reflections- the inability to detect the conflict by air traffic controlThe Canadair had been cleared to taxi to the holding point runway 04L via taxiways U, A, then was cleared cross runway 04L and continue to holding point 04R via taxiways A and W. The aircraft reached the holding point properly.The Raytheon had been cleared to taxi to the holding point runway 04L via taxiway A, and was cleared to cross runway 04L.After the EC-HHV had been cleared to line up runway 04R and wait, the Raytheon was cleared to continue to holding point 04R via taxiways A and W, but missed the turn onto taxiway W and continued to taxi straight onto runway 04R.In the meantime EC-HHV had been cleared for takeoff and began the takeoff roll. When the aircraft had reached about normal taxi speed the crew spotted the Raytheon on the runway and rejected takeoff reporting the other aircraft on the runway. The aircraft came to a stop after about 150 meters of takeoff roll.The tower in the meantime inquired with the Raytheon crew to confirm they were on taxiway W but got the reply they believed they were on a runway.The Raytheon crew reported later, that they had difficulty identifying the taxiway lights after crossing runway 04L and were following the center yellow line which they believed would guide them across taxiway V and towards taxiway W. When they saw the white lights and the lights of another aircraft they got aware of being on a runway. The crew was not familiar with the airport of Nice at night.The tower controller said he was busy monitoring an arrival on final for runway 04L and monitoring the departure of EC-HHV on runway 04R, the size of the Raytheon also made it hard if not impossible to determine the location of the aircraft while looking down from the tower.Runway incursions are frequent at Nice, holding points were therefore equipped with wig-wag lights at each side of the taxiway and orange flashing lights in a distance of 3 meters across the taxiway. The lighting at holding point A3 was working properly at the time of the incident.In reality the taxi lines leading towards taxiways V and W split from the taxiway A line between runway 04L and holding point A2, while the taxiway lines split off taxiway A after holding point A2 on the aerodrome chart. The marking "W" was hardly visible while crossing the taxiway W center line.At the time of the incident the green center line lighting of taxiway V (including the turn off taxiway A) was turned off, only the green center line lighting of taxiway W including the turn off taxiway A was illuminated, the green center line lighting along taxiway A between holding points A2 and A3 was also illuminated.The airport of Nice does not have ground radar available and has no runway incursion management and collision avoidance system.Since the incident the center line lighting towards holding point A3 has been obscured and the use of line up runway 04R via A3 has been prohibited at night.The BEA analysed that crews expected to see the turn off for taxiway V after crossing holding point A2 and before the turn off for taxiway W. The branch to taxiway V however was not visible, the label indicating "W" was hardly visible due to the low cockpit height and the lights around.The lighting at holding point A3 (wig wag, orange lights embedded in hold short line) did not prevent the Raytheon crew, looking for the branch onto taxiway W, from crossing the hold short line and inadvertently enter the runway.The taxiroutes put into the actual aerodrome chart (Graphics: BEA):Detail Satellite Image of taxiway intersection A,V and W (Photo: Google Earth):Map (Photo: Google Earth):
A LAN Airlines Airbus A318-100, registration CC-CVV performing flight LU-204 from Concepcion to Santiago (Chile), rejected takeoff at low speed after the right hand engine (PW6124) failed. The airplane slowed safely and returned to the apron.A replacement aircraft reached Santiago with a delay of 5 hours.
A Morningstar Boeing 757-200, registration C-FMFG performing freight flight MAL-7050 from Winnipeg,MB to Calgary,AB (Canada) with 2 crew, rejected takeoff from Winnipeg's runway 31 at high speed when the fire bell activated. The aircraft stopped safely, the crew reported they had no indication of an engine fire but the fire bell could not be cancelled. Responding emergency services found no trace of fire, heat or smoke.The Canadian TSB reported that emergency services and maintenance found no anomalies. The aircraft was powered down and powered up and the fire indication ceased. The airplane returned to service.
A Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-400, registration UR-GAV performing flight PS-4433 from Odessa (Ukraine) to Sharm el Sheikh (Egypt), rejected takeoff from Odessa when the left hand engine's (CFM56) oil pressure dropped. The airplane slowed safely, the crew received an additional message "CSD LOW OIL PRESSURE" for the left hand engine and returned to the apron.Ukraine's Civil Aviation Authority reported in their March Bulletin in Ukrainian that contaminations were found in the main oil filter, metal shavings were found in the oil pressure lines and on the chip detector. Internal damage was found in the constant speed drive (CSD) that caused metallic fragments to get stuck in an oil pressure line disrupting the oil flow to the engine. The investigation is continuing.
A BMI British Midland Airbus A321-200, registration G-MEDN performing flight BD-997 (scheduled dep May 2nd) from Beirut (Lebanon) to Khartoum (Sudan) with 45 passengers, rejected takeoff from Beirut's runway 21 at high speed after an engine (V2533) ingested a bird. The airplane slowed safely and returned to the apron.The legs Beirut-Khartoum-Beirut were cancelled.A replacement Airbus A320-200 registration G-MEDH was dispatched from London,EN (UK) to Beirut as flight BD-9521 and is currently estimated to reach London Heathrow on return flight BD-996 from Beirut to London with a delay of 6 hours.
A Ryanair Boeing 737-800, registration EI-DHR performing flight FR-2568 from Stockholm Skavsta (Sweden) to Malaga,SP (Spain), rejected takeoff from Skavsta Airport at high speed, the airplane slowed safely and came to a stop about 100-200 meters/300-600 feet before the runway end.The airplane was able to depart about 2 hours later and is currently estimated to reach Malaga with a delay of 2:10 hours.The cause of the takeoff being rejected is unknown.
A Westjet Boeing 737-800, registration C-FAWJ performing flight WS-1187 from Fort Myers,FL (USA) to Toronto,ON (Canada) with 154 people on board, was in the takeoff roll when the crew heard unusual sounds. Shortly after retracting the gear the crew received a failure indication for the A hydraulic system. The crew actioned the relevant checklist, declared emergency and returned to Fort Myers for a safe landing.The Canadian TSB reported maintenance found the #3 tyre's (inner tyre right hand main gear) outer cap missing although the tyre was still inflated. Hydraulic lines within the wheel well had been damaged resulting in the loss of hydraulic fluid of the A system. Fort Myers did not report any tyre cap being recovered. Records showed the tyre had been on its second recap and had accumulated 225 cycles since installation.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/WJA1187/history/20110420/0125Z/KRSW/CYYZ
A Ryanair Boeing 737-800, registration EI-EBE performing flight FR-9844 from Cork to Dublin (Ireland) with 164 passengers and 6 crew, was cleared for takeoff from Cork's runway 17. When the aircraft began its takeoff roll, a police car holding on runway 17 short of runway 07/25 recognized the conflict and accelerated to vacate runway 17 onto runway 07/25. While the Boeing accelerated through 90 knots the Ryanair crew spotted the car already disappearing onto runway 07/25 and clear of runway 17, so that they continued the takeoff. The Boeing reached Dublin for a safe landing.The Irish AAIU have released their final report concluding the probable cause was:Take-off clearance was issued to a B737 on RWY 17 while an Operations vehicle was holding as cleared at the intersection of RWY 17-25.Contributory Factors1. Situational awareness with regard to the position of Police 1 vehicle was temporarily lost by the Air Movement Controller (AMC) despite a visual scan being made of the runway prior to clearing the B737 for take-off.2. The Police 1 vehicle was difficult to see from the tower at the time of the incident due a combination of vehicle colour and profile, the wet conditions on the runway, and rain on the tower windows. The framing around the glass may also have contributed to the vehicle being obscured.3. Removal of the Runway Occupied strip holder from the active flight progress board when Electrician 1 was clear may have reinforced the belief that the runway was clear.4. The use of a different communication frequency by vehicles and aircraft while occupying the same active runway.During the shift the surface movement controller (SMC), also known as ground controller, received a phone call on family matters the natureo f which the AAIU understood was distressing. The SMC subsequently requested relief from his position and upon approval by the Air Movement Controller (AMC), also known as tower controller, left his position. The AMC covered both tower and ground frequency during the SMC's relief break. Workload for the AMC was light at that time.The Ryanair crew requested startup, a few seconds later a vehicle "Electrician 1" was cleared to enter runway 17 to perform work at the threshoold, a runway occupied strip was properly placed on the strip board. A light aircraft had been doing circuits around runway 17 and was switched to do circuits on runway 25 to cater for the pending departure of the 737.40 seconds after the Ryanair requested startup another vehicle "Police 1" transmitting on ground frequency requested to enter runway 17 for a runway inspection with the intention to turn onto runway 25 and continue towards the threshold of runway 07. Police 1, a white saloon type vehicle with an amber rotating beacon at its top, was cleared to enter runway 17 and hold short of runway 07/25 because of the light aircraft in the pattern runway 25.2 minutes later another light aircraft and another commercial departure requested startup, the Ryanair 737 requested taxi for departure. The Boeing was cleared to taxi towards the holding point of runway 17, the AMC then called "Electrician 1" to vacate the runway and reported clear of the runway 5 minutes after the 737 had requested startup. As a result the AMC removed the "Runway Occupied" strip from the strip board.A minute later the 737 reported on tower frequency and was cleared to line up and wait. The AMC scanned the runway, did not notice "Police 1" still holding on runway 17 short and just north of runway 07/25 due to the colouring of the vehicle and rain on the tower windows, and cleared the Ryanair Boeing for takeoff about one minute after the line up and wait clearance. At that time there had been no communication with Police 1 for about 4 minutes.16 seconds after the takeoff clearance the police car sped onto runway 07 to vacate runway 17 and reported to do so on ground frequency.The commander of EI-EBE spotted the car while the 737 accelerated through 90 knots. The car had already turned onto runway 07 and was clear of runway 17, so that the crew continued their takeoff. The AAIU reported the distance between the vehicle and aircraft had been 700 meters/2300 feet just prior to the conflict being resolved.Immediately after the incident the SMC was recalled to the tower and replaced the AMC according to incident procedures. A replacement SMC on duty in the general office was called to assist and arrived some time later. The incident was reported to the operations manager without a delay and an occurrence report was filed.The AMC said, that the Police 1 vehicle was difficult to see due to its colouring, low profile, wet conditions and rain on the tower windows. View of the vehicle may also have been obscured by one of the pillars of the tower cab.The driver of Police 1 said he became aware that the engines of the Boeing 737 accelerated and decided to speed off onto runway 07 to vacate runway 17. He then reported on ground frequency to do so, his report was acknowledged by the AMC.The AAIU analysed, that the workload of the AMC increased a few minutes after the SMC began his relief break, the workload remained manageable however contributed to the level of distraction to the AMC."Police 1" was on ground frequency and could not hear the takeoff clearance.After Electrician 1 had entered the runway the runway occupied strip was properly placed on the strip board, and was removed after Electrician 1 vacated the runway, the removal was in error however as Police 1 having entered the runway at a later stage was still on the runway.Internal investigations of the Irish Aviation Authority issued 9 safety recommendations including mandating ground vehicles now being required to monitor both ground and tower frequencies at all times and are using the tower frequency to transmit when entering/vacating runways. Another recommendation was to require controllers maintain a record of all vehicle operations on the runway for ease of reference and to assist in hand overs. Those 9 recommendations were all accepted and implemented, so that the AAIU did not see a need to issue further safety recommendations.Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):
A Yakutia Boeing 757-200, registration VQ-BMW performing flight R3-9914 from Dresden (Germany) to Moscow Vnukovo (Russia), rejected takeoff from Dresden's runway 04 due to an open door indication. The airplane slowed safely and vacated the runway. Emergency services cooled the brakes, the airplane subsequently returned to the apron.The aircraft was able to depart about one hour later and reached Moscow with a total delay of 4.5 hours (including a delay of 3 hours of the incoming flight R3-9913).
A British Airways Boeing 747-400, registration G-CIVA performing flight BA-282 from Los Angeles,CA (USA) to London Heathrow,EN (UK), rejected takeoff from Los Angeles' runway 25R at high speed (approx. 100 KIAS) after the crew received a fault message for the main gear steering. The airplane stopped on the runway for about two minutes, the crew did not request assistance. After assessing the aircraft status the crew taxied off the runway to engineering.Following repairs the airplane was able to depart about 4 hours later and reached London with a delay of 3:45 hours.
An Air France Airbus A319-100, registration F-GRHU performing flight AF-2253 from St. Petersburg (Russia) to Paris Charles de Gaulle (France), rejected takeoff from St. Petersburg at high speed after an engine (CFM56) ingested a bird. The airplane slowed safely, briefly stopped on the runway and returned to the apron.The flight was subsequently cancelled.
A Bluebird Cargo Boeing 737-400, registration TF-BBH performing an acceptance flight BF-229 from Budapest (Hungary) to Budapest (Hungary) with 3 crew, rejected takeoff from Budapest's runway 31L at high speed after the tower observed smoke from the left hand wing. The airplane slowed safely and vacated the runway onto taxiway C about 2450 meters/8050 feet down the runway. Responding emergency services found a fuel leak from the left hand wing and needed to cool hot brakes prompting the crew to vacate the aircraft. It was subsequently discovered that the fuel filler cap had dropped off the left wing. The airplane was towed to the maintenance hangar about one hour after rejecting takeoff.The airplane had undergone major maintenance in Budapest starting March 19th and was just to position to resume service.TF-BBH on taxiway C:
A V Australia Boeing 777-300, registration VH-VOZ performing flight VA-2 from Los Angeles,CA (USA) to Sydney,NS (Australia) with 305 passengers, rejected takeoff from Los Angeles' runway 25R at low speed after the crew heard a bang and thought they had a problem with a tyre on the nose gear. The airplane stopped after a roll distance of about 440 meters/1440 feet, the crew requested emergency services to check the runway for debris. The crew of another aircraft reported they had seen a spark off the nose gear, the crew of a third aircraft reported they had also seen a fire ball off engine #1 (GE90). The crew decided to hold on the runway and wait for emergency services to arrive and examine the aircraft. The aircraft taxied to the apron about 10 minutes later.The passengers were taken to hotels and are expected to depart the following day.V Australia said the crew returned to the terminal as a precaution due to an issue with the performance of the left engine.
Tyre debris recovered from runway 25 (Photo: ANSV)The Italian National Agency for Aviation Safety ("Agenzia Nazionale per la Sicurezza del Volo", ANSV) concluded in their final report:The emergency return of the aircraft was caused by damage to the left engine during takeoff following the ingestion of pieces of the left outer main gear tyre (#1).It can be reasonably assumed that some foreign object damaged the tyre presumably while the aircraft taxied along taxiway NG.The lack of survey of foreign objects found during cleaning of aprons and operating areas prevents identification and effective elimination of sources of foreign objects.The airport operator should exercise tighter control on punctual cleaning of aprons and operating areas contracted out to third party entities and should exercise tighter control especially in areas of increased risk of foreign objects.I-DACY had been parked at position 528 and was cleared to taxi along taxiways H, NG, N to holding point BB (about 740 meters down runway 25, 2130 meters of runway length remaining). The airplane was subsequently cleared for takeoff from runway 25, a number of pieces separated from the outboard left hand main gear tyre and were ingested by the left hand engine. After rotation, while climbing through 200 feet AGL, the left engine suffered a compressor stall prompting the crew to declare emergency. The aircraft was cleared to return to runway 16R, the crew requested and was cleared to land on runway 16L for a safe landing. The aircraft stopped on the runway for an inspection by emergency services and after being declared fit to taxi taxied to the apron.The left engine received substantial damage and needed to be replaced. Impact marks of tyre debris were found on the underside of the left wing aft of the left main gear strut and on the inlet and cowling of the left engine. Both left hand main wheels had to be replaced, the #1 wheel due to damage received by the tyre separation and the #2 wheel due to exceeding the maximum permissable load after the failure of the #1 wheel.The ANSV observed that two more aircraft having taxied along taxiway NG reported tyre damage at the time.Construction work was being carried out on taxiway R between taxiways CR and H as well as on taxiway CR between taxiway R and stand 603. The construction vehicles would get to and from the construction site via the airport main access road crossing taxiway NG on one of the two two lane roads across the taxiway.Sweeping of aprons and operational areas was contracted out to a third party provider who ran three sweeping vehicles. An additional van was dispatched to collect debris. The contractor was free to define sweeping routes and the timing of sweeping.The damaged tyre (Photo: ANSV):The engine damage (Photo: ANSV):Taxiroute (Graphics: ANSV/Google Earth):
A Thai Airways Airbus A330-300, registration HS-TET performing aircraft acceptance flight TG-8342 from Hamburg Fuhlsbüttel to Hamburg Fuhlsbüttel (Germany) with 8 crew on board, did not retract the gear after takeoff and stopped the climb out of Hamburg's runway 33 at 7000 feet. The airplane returned to Hamburg prematurely, landed safely on runway 05 (runway landing distance available 2952 meters/9680 feet) and came to a stop just short of taxiway B about 2800 meters/9200 feet down the runway about 24 minutes after departure. The airplane needed to be towed off the runway.Hamburg's emergency services reported the crew had indicated problems with the brakes.A listener on frequency heard the crew reporting the loss of a hydraulic system immediately after takeoff.The airplane was able to complete the acceptance flight the following day (Apr 10th) and departed for its positioning flight TG-8921 to Bangkok (Thailand) on Apr 11th.Runway 33 has a landing distance of 3220 meters/10560 feet available (runway 15's LDA is 3666 meters/12000 feet).Metars:EDDH 091050Z 33006KT 9999 FEW040 12/03 Q1023 NOSIG EDDH 091020Z VRB03KT 9999 FEW032 12/03 Q1023 NOSIG EDDH 090950Z 33004KT 280V360 9999 FEW028 11/03 Q1023 NOSIGEDDH 090920Z 32004KT 280V030 9999 FEW024 11/04 Q1023 NOSIGEDDH 090850Z 31006KT 9999 FEW018 10/04 Q1023 NOSIGEDDH 090820Z 31007KT 9999 FEW015 09/04 Q1023 NOSIG EDDH 090750Z 30008KT 9999 FEW015 08/04 Q1022 NOSIG EDDH 090720Z 33009KT 9999 FEW015 08/04 Q1022 NOSIG HS-TET over Hamburg-Eidelstedt on final about 2nm from runway 05 (Photo: Olischa):HS-TET after landing (Photo: Lars Hentschel):
A Cathay Pacific Airbus A330-300, registration B-HLO performing flight CX-732 from Riyadh (Saudi Arabia) to Hong Kong (China), rejected takeoff from Riyadh's runway 33R after the left hand engine (Trent 772) failed. The airplane slowed safely and returned to the apron.The airplane is still on the ground in Riyadh (Apr 10th).
An Air Canada Airbus A319-100, registration C-GBIN performing flight AC-1294 from Toronto,ON (Canada) to Aruba (Aruba) with 69 people on board, was accelerating for takeoff from runway 23 when the lower ECAM and the first officers primary flight display and navigation display failed accompanied by an acrid smell. The crew continued the takeoff, declared emergency in the initial climb reporting smoke and electrical smell, stopped the climb at 3000 feet and returned to Toronto's runway 23. On downwind the crew indicated they'd need to stop on the runway but did not expect an evacuation, reaffirming on final that they did not expect an evacuation but needed a tow. The crew performed a safe landing about 13 minutes later, the airplane was towed to the gate.The Canadian TSB reported maintenance found two circuit breakers tripped (for the bus2 electrical supply and the Brake and Steering Control Unit (BSCU)). The BSCU did not show any malfunction, abnormal odour or signs of overheating/burning. The #2 transformer rectifier unit was replaced, systems checked operative thereafter and the airplane returned to service.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/ACA1294/history/20110403/1400Z/CYYZ/TNCA
A Jetblue Airbus A320-200, registration N535JB performing flight B6-507 from Newark,NJ to Fort Lauderdale,FL (USA) with 134 passengers and 6 crew, dropped parts of the left hand engine's (V2527) cowling during the takeoff run from Newark's runway 22R. The crew continued takeoff, levelled off at 3000 feet and flew a right hand traffic pattern for a safe landing on runway 22L about 12 minutes after departure.Runway 22R had to be closed to collect the debris.The NTSB reported on May 4th 2010, that the left hand engine's cowling separated during takeoff. The flight remained unaware of the separation until passengers pointed out the loss of the entire left engine cowl assembly. A post flight inspection revealed further damage to the left hand engine pylon, leading edge flaps, left main landing gear and horizontal stabilizer. The separated cowl is being examined for evidence of failures of the latching mechanism, the hinges or structure.On Mar 15th 2011 the NTSB released their factual report that no damage was found that would be consistent with properly fastened and secured latches to keep the cowling in place.Jetblue had developed some visual highlight to permit identification whether a latch was properly fastened and secured. The latches are weighted, the inside and side of the latches are painted in a different colour (usually red or orange) to the cowling skin. If the latch is fastened and secured the latch is flush with the cowling skin and shows the same colour as the skin with the other colour being invisible. If the assembly is not properly secured the latch handle exposes at least part of the painted surface. An examination shows all latches and handles were properly weighted and painted.In examination of other aircraft the NTSB identified a false latch condition that could mask an otherwise unlocked position. While working on engines mechanics routinely push the latch assembly up against the latch keeper housing assembly in order to stow the latch to avoid inadvertent head injuries while working underneath the engine. In this position the latch is neither fastened nor secured, but the latch assembly is flush with the engine cowling with the coloured part of the latch handle not being visible giving the impression the latch is fastened and secured. NTSB staff and Jetblue safety investigators repeated that temporary stowing of the latch assembly and were able to demonstrate that the latch assembly could get stuck within the latch keeper housing giving the false impression the cowling latch was properly latched and locked.The NTSB subsequently concluded the probable cause was:The separation of both halves of the left engine fan cowl assembly due to improper latching and locking of the all the fan cowl latches. The cause of the improper latching and locking of the fan cowls was due to the failure of the mechanic to unstow and properly latch and lock the fan cowl latches after the engine maintenance had been completed, and the failure of the maintenance inspector to detect and identify the unlatched condition. Contributing the incident is the design of the fan cowl latch assembly that can provide a false latch condition when the latch is neither latched or locked. Also contributing incident is the lack of adequate Airbus and Jet Blue fan cowl latch inspection guidance to detect and identify an unlatched condition.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/JBU507/history/20100405/1018Z/KEWR/KFLL
A TUIFly Boeing 737-800, registration D-AHFO performing flight X3-2143 from Tenerife Sur Reina Sofia,CI (Spain) to Frankfurt/Main (Germany) with 189 passengers and 6 crew, rejected takeoff from runway 08 at high speed (about 80-90 knots) after the tail contacted the runway. The airplane slowed without further incident, no injuries occurred, the airplane received substantial damage including a ruptured fuselage and scrape damage along 2 meters on the belly of the aircraft.A replacement Boeing 737-800 registration D-AHFH reached Frankfurt with a delay of 15 hours.The Spanish CIAIAC confirmed the tailstrike and the rejected takeoff. The CIAIAC is in contact with the German BFU regarding the occurrence. The BFU reported without providing further details on Mar 31st that they are investigating the occurrence.A passenger (frequent flyer) reported, that from the start of the takeoff roll the takeoff appeared a little bit different to previous takeoffs of Boeing 737-800s, he perceived the takeoff sounds louder and the takeoff more choppy than usual. The passenger could not say whether he saw the nose go up first or first heard a scratching sound, a moment later the brakes came on and the airplane decelerated rapidly. The airplane stopped on the runway and subsequently taxied to a remote stand on the apron, where technicians entered the aircraft. The captain announced they had a faulty instrument and were trying to fix the problem. After a couple more minutes, during which busses were ordered and arrived, all passengers disembarked normally via stairs. He exited through the rear door and from the side took a look at the tail of the aircraft but didn't notice anything unusual.

A British Airways Boeing 747-400, registration G-BYGE performing flight BA-56 from Johannesburg (South Africa) to London Heathrow,EN (UK), rejected takeoff from Johannesburg's runway 21R at high speed (about 85 KIAS) after the left hand outer engine (RB211) emitted a huge bang and lost power. The airplane slowed safely and returned to the apron.Maintenance determined the engine failed due to a fueling problem.The flight was postponed to the next day initially, but the aircraft needed to reject takeoff again at low speed this time due to a fuel leak. The airplane got towed back to the apron.The flight got further postponed by another day and reached London on a replacement Boeing 747-400 registration G-CIVX as flight BA-56A on Saturday Apr 2nd with a delay of 49.5 hours. The regular flight BA-56 departing on Apr 1st and arriving Apr 2nd, scheduled to be operated by G-BYGE, had to be cancelled however.
Location of tail strike (Graphics: ATSB)The Australian Transportation Safety Board (ATSB) released their final report concluding:Contributing safety factors- The aircrafts speed stagnated briefly when it was subject to fluctuating surface wind conditions during rotation for takeoff.- As the pilot applied right control input to counter crosswind effects, the flight spoilers activated resulting in a small loss of lift.- The pilots elevator input increased the instantaneous pitch rate beyond that typically seen for B747-400 aircraft.- The reduced-thrust takeoff increased the aircrafts exposure to wind gusts during rotation.The captain was pilot flying, the airplane was prepared for a reduced thrust takeoff from runway 34L using flaps 10. Temperature was 23 degrees C, winds were coming from 300 degrees at 10 knots.The captain had operated many times into Sydney and recalled, that in previous departures in similiar wind conditions the airplane was affected by variable cross winds from the international terminal buildings at about the point of rotation near the intersection with runway 25 and briefed the crew accordingly while taxiing for departure.During the pre-takeoff checks the first officer comments that the controls felt a bit lighter than normal. The captain agreed but considered the system to be within acceptable limits.The captain commenced a rolling takeoff using the full runway length. During rotation the captain felt the airplane reacted "slightly more aggressive" than he expected, however none of the crew got aware of anything unusual, the captain kept focus on establishing a proper climb. No system indications occurred. When the aircraft climbed through 1000 feet the tower advised another aircraft had observed their tail contacting the runway during rotation. The relief pilot talked to the cabin crew, one flight attendant reported hearing a sound like freight shifting, but none reported a sound consistent with a tail strike. The crew levelled off at 8000 feet, completed the tail strike on takeoff checklist which prompted the depressurization of the cabin, dumped fuel and returned to Sydney for a safe landing.The aircraft received abrasion damage to the tail cone, damage to the auxiliary power unit bay access doors and lower fuselage frames at the tail cone. There was no damage to the pressure bulkhead structure.The aircraft had accumulated 40696 hours in 4881 cycles at the time of the occurrence, no maintenance items were outstanding. The aircraft's gross weight at takeoff was 828,223lbs/375,682kg (well below MTOW of 875,000 lbs), the center of gravity was at 12.7% MAC and trim was set to 8.9 units. After landing the CG was confirmed to be within limits, all cargo had been properly loaded. Checks of the elevator system showed all parameters within limits except for the the elevator body cable, the tension of which was a slightly below limit.The actual winds at takeoff were reported from 327 degrees true at 9 knots gusting 11 knots.The flight data recorder showed that during the takeoff run the captain applied right rudder consistent with a left crosswind. Just after the takeoff rotation began the airplane began to roll right reaching 1.5 degrees of right bank which was countered by a 15 degrees left wheel input causing the flight spoilers to deploy. At the same time an (unspecified) loss of airspeed occurred.The spoilers caused a loss of lift that although small further reduced tail clearance. The airplane reached a pitch angle of 12.5 degrees when the air/ground sensors began to transition and a sharp spike was recorded in the load factor giving evidence, that the tail strike occurred at that point. The sensors fully transitioned to air 1.3 second later, the airplane became airborne about 150 meters south of the runway intersection 34L/25.The ATSB analysed that the loss of airspeed together with the spoiler extension as result of environmental factors reduced the tail clearance to a point, where the tail contacted the runway during rotation. An additional factor was the reduced thrust takeoff which caused longer exposure to wind gusts and thus reduced tail clearance. The reduced thrust takeoff was company procedure, so that the crew had only control over the pitch and pitch rate. The flight data analysis showed that the pitch rate was about 0.5 degrees/sec greater than usually expected. That pitch rate increase coincided with the effect of a wind gust, that reduced the aircraft's speed and acceleration extending the time needed to become airborne while the airplane was rotating. Had the pitch rate increase not occurred, it can be safely assumed that the aircraft would have become safely airborne.Boeing analysed that the takeoff thrust settings, control inputs as well as reaction of the aircraft to the control inputs were about to be expected and had no significance for the tail strike.Abrasions on the tail (Photo: ATSB):
A Lufthansa Airbus A321-200, registration D-AIDC performing flight LH-2064 from Munich to Hamburg (Germany), rejected takeoff from Munich's runway 08L at high speed. The airplane slowed safely and returned to the apron.After checks and the replacement of two tyres the airplane was able to depart again and reached Hamburg with a delay of 160 minutes.According to a passenger the captain explained the tower ordered them to reject takeoff after another departure on the parallel runway 08R turned left after becoming airborne instead of turning right causing a potential conflict.
A TAM Linhas Aereas Airbus A319-100, registration PT-TMA performing flight JJ-3269 from Rio de Janeiro Galeao,RJ to Curitiba,PR (Brazil), rejected takeoff from Rio de Janeiro's International Airport at high speed after an engine (V2524) ingested a bird. The airplane slowed safely.The flight was cancelled, the passenger were rebooked on later flights.
An Air Baltic de Havilland Dash 8-400, registration YL-BAE performing flight BT-339 from Riga (Latvia) to Helsinki (Finland), returned to Riga due to a hydraulics failure shortly after departure. The crew needed to extend the gear manually and landed safely about one hour after takeoff. The airplane stopped on the runway and was towed to the apon.The runway was closed for about 30 minutes.The flight was cancelled.
A Kelowna Flightcraft Boeing 727-200, registration C-GKFJ performing flight KFA-321 from Hamilton,ON to Winnipeg,MB (Canada), rejected takeoff from runway 30 at low speed after flames were observed from an engine (JT8D). The airplane stopped safely and returned to the apron.The Canadian TSB repored on Mar 24th that the crew rejected takeoff due to lack of air speed indication on the captain's instruments. During the rejected takeoff flames were observed on the #1 and #3 (left and right hand) engines, likely due to induced compressor stalls. There were no injuries, the airplane received no damage.
An Expressjet Embraer ERJ-145 on behalf of Continental Airlines, registration N33182 performing flight XE-2100/CO-2100 from Queretaro (Mexico) to Houston,TX (USA), rejected takeoff from Queretaro's runway 09 at low speed. The airplane slowed safely and returned to the apron.The airplane was able to depart again about 4 hours later and reached Houston with a delay of 3:40 hours.A passenger reported the airplane rejected takeoff because of a technical problem with an engine (Ae3007). The passenger later added, that they departed runway 09. About 10 seconds after the engines spooled up for takeoff the takeoff was rejected, nothing abnormal had been observed until then.
A Qantas Airbus A330-300, registration VH-QPJ performing flight QF-87 from Sydney,NS (Australia) to Hong Kong (China), departed Sydney with a gross weight, that exceeded the maximum takeoff weight by about 884 kg/1950 lbs. The airplane reached Hong Kong safely.The Australian Transportation Safety Board (ATSB) released their final report concluding:Contributing safety factors- The load controller selected the 'Approve Distribution' flight management function before the load distribution for the flight was finalised.- The load controller had not finalised the load distribution for the flight when the Flight Management Event Scheduler automatically issued a Graphical Load Instruction Report that predicted that the aircraft would significantly exceed its maximum taxi and take-off weights. - The load controller did not reissue the Graphical Load Instruction Report on finalisation of the aircrafts load distribution. The load controller did not identify a discrepancy between the Graphical Load Instruction Report and the loading information contained in the Flight Management system when completing the final distribution check.Other safety factors- The entry of incorrect weight and balance data into the aircrafts systems adversely affected the accuracy of the data and/or functions provided by those systems and had the potential to affect the safety of flight.- A significant breakdown in the operators internal reporting procedures contributed to the delayed notification of the maximum taxi weight exceedance, and in the assessment of the need for any checks/inspections before further flight to assure the aircrafts ongoing airworthiness.Other key findings- There had been no quality assurance review of the Regional Load Control centre in the 22 months preceding the incident.The aircraft was being prepared for the flight. About 80 minutes prior to scheduled departure the flight management system indicated an additional uplift of fuel was needed for operational requirements, that brought the airplane about 335 kg/740 lbs above maximum taxi and about 884 kg/1950 lbs above maximum takeoff weight.In response the load controller contacted the relevant departments and identified a number of cargo pallets that could be removed from the aircraft. The load controller subsequently checked a number of variations of how to get to an optimum loading, the flight management system however did not permit that check without selecting the "approve distribution" button. This button also enabled the automatic distribution of the graphical load distribution report (GLR), that was released to the ramp workers 60 minutes prior to the scheduled departure.About 16 minutes after the automatic release of the GLR the load controller finalised the selection of pallets to not be loaded substituing the pallets with a lighter pallet. At that time a GLR was brought to the controllers desk, the load controller remembered that he did not realize this was a report printed with the earlier outdated load data. He also did not realize that a GLR with the revised load distribution had not been released.Once the loading was finished the load supervisor at the ramp was required to call the load controller and read back the loaded configuration including the position and weight of each pallet loaded. The controller would compare the readback against the data in the flight management system, any last minute changes would be transmitted. In the incident the pallet, that should have been offloaded, was contained in the first item read back by the load supervisor, and the load controller did not realize the discrepancy to the revised pallet.The load controller subsequently completed the final distribution check which also did not catch the discrepancy between the read back and the actual distribution and the final load sheet was transmitted to the on-board flight management system of the aircraft.The airplane subsequently performed a seemingly uneventful flight and landed safely in Hong Kong.When the ground staff in Hong Kong unloaded the aircraft they noticed the discrepancy between the pallets listed on the load sheet and the actual loaded pallets. The load supervisor was notified by the ramp personnel, but did not file an aircraft loading irregularity report.The (ground based) flight management system indicated the heavier pallet (that had arrived in Hong Kong) was still in Sydney and needed to be taken to Hong Kong. Because the pallet could not be located anywhere in Sydney checks were made and it was discovered that the pallet had travelled to Hong Kong the previous day. Sydney's load supervisor subsequently filed the according reports and an internal investigation commenced by Mar 9th. The operator's safety department became aware of the incident on Mar 12th and notified the engineering department to conduct the necessary overweight taxi checks, that were conducted 10 days after the event.The ATSB annotated that the wrong gross weight, indicating just below maximum takeoff weight although being above the maximum takeoff weight, impaired the aircraft's computations of center of gravity, takeoff trim settings, reference speed computations, performance predictions, flight control primary computer control laws, stall speed with wings level, characteristic speeds (e.g. optimum climb) and the automatic regulation of fuel transfers between the tanks. The investigation determined, that the actual trim setting for takeoff would have been 4.1 UP for the center of gravity being at 28.3% MAC, whereas the load sheet had shown a 3.4 UP trim settings with a center of gravity at 26.8% MAC. Due to the additional weight on board the total fuel consumption was computed to be 1200kg/2650lbs higher than predicted by the flight plan based on the revised load sheet data.The ATSB analysed that although the discrepancy between planned load and actual load was relatively minor, the mismatch had the potential to affect the safety of the flight.
A Ryanair Boeing 737-800, registration EI-EFZ performing flight FR-6443 from Fuerteventura,CI (Spain) to Brussels Charleroi (Belgium) with 170 passengers, burst a tyre on takeoff from Fuerteventura but continued the flight to Brussels Charleroi Airport, where the crew declared emergency on approach. The airplane continued for a safe landing on Charleroi's runway 07 about 5 hours after departure from the Canary Islands.
A Saudi Arabian Airlines Airbus A320-200, flight SV-1145 from Dammam to Riyadh (Saudi Arabia), rejected takeoff from Dammam's runway 34R at high speed after thick black smoke appeared in the cabin causing commotion amongst the passengers. The airplane stopped safely. There are no reports about the aircraft being evacuated, a passenger video instead reveals the captain trying to calm the passengers via an announcement and the absence of the evacuation signal.Passenger Nofah intended to film the cloud formation during takeoff (see the video below) and published his resulting video 3 days later. Another passenger, who published his video on the day of the occurrence, claims he was forced to remove his video. Other passengers reported thick black smoke appeared in the cabin, however did not mention how they got off the aircraft.A replacement aircraft reached Riyadh.Passenger video (Video: Nofah):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmO8RjJtGg

A Delta Airlines Boeing 767-300, flight DL-121 from New York JFK,NY (USA) to Sao Paulo Guarulhos,SP (Brazil), departed New York's runway 22R, tower reported winds from 150 degrees at 24 knots, but struck its tail onto the runway while rotating for takeoff at 21:33L (02:33Z Mar 7th). The aircraft continued departure and climbed to FL290 before the crew decided to return to New York about 20 minutes into the flight. The aircraft entered a holding and landed safely on runway 13L about 80 minutes after departure.A Fedex McDonnell Douglas MD-10, registration N559FE performing flight FX-764 from Memphis,TN to New York JFK,NY (USA), on final approach to runway 22L went around from low height due to a windshear alert about 60 seconds after the departure of DL-121.

An Austrian Airlines Fokker 70, registration OE-LFL performing flight OS-114 from Munich (Germany) to Vienna (Austria) with 56 passengers and 4 crew, dropped the outboard wheel from the right hand main gear during takeoff from Munich. The crew decided to return to Munich for a low approach between both runways to have the tower inspect the landing gear, after which the aircraft landed safely on runway 08R about 30 minutes after departure and stopped on taxiway B10. The flight was cancelled, the passengers were rebooked onto other flights.Passengers reported, that both runways in Munich were temporarily closed causing domestic flights (within Germany) already taxiing for departure to Munich to return to their gates.The wheel was recovered from the runway where it dropped immediately after the gear became airborne.OE-LFL on approach to Munich (Photo: mucspotter.de):
A Dynamic Airlines Swearingen SA-227 Metroliner, registration PH-DYM performing a charter flight from Rotterdam (Netherlands) to Birmingham,EN (UK) with 17 passengers and 2 crew, had lined up Rotterdam's runway 24 for takeoff but began to veer left of the runway while the aircraft accelerated for takeoff. The aircraft left the left edge of the runway about 6 seconds after the engines accelerated for takeoff, all gear collapsed on soft ground before the aircraft came to a stop. One passenger received minor injuries and was taken to a local hospital but discharged the same day, the airplane received substantial damage.The Dutch Onderzoeksraad (Dutch Safety Board DSB) have released their final report concluding the probable cause of the accident was:This accident was caused by an hydraulic leakage in the nose wheel steering system. The tyre tracks on the runway implied that the steering problem had occurred from the beginning of the take-off. The crew intervened as soon as after the nose wheel switch had been released and the nose wheel steering fault came on but were unable to prevent the aircraft leaving the runway.The first officer was pilot flying for the depature. During line up on runway 24 the nose wheel steering fault indicator came up, the captain indicated he had forgotten to press the nose gear steering switch on the throttles, the first officer then confirmed he had nose gear steering again.After receiving takeoff clearance the first officer advanced the power levers and initiated the takeoff roll. As soon as the nose gear steering switch was released the aircraft began to veer left, the first officer attemtped to counter by applying directional braking and right rudder, the airplane however continued to move left off the runway at a speed of about 50-60 knots. Although neither pilot issued the command to reject takeoff, the takeoff was aborted. The aircraft however departed the paved surface of the runway onto deep soft ground, the left main gear sunk into the soft ground and collapsed throwing the aircraft into a left turn which brought the nose and right gear strut to collapse. After the airplane came to a standstill, the captain shut down all aircraft systems while the first officer initiated the evacuation of the aircraft through the left hand main door.The DSB reported that during examination of the nose gear steering system the National Aerospace Laboratory discovered a hydraulic leak in the system which meant the nose gear steering no longer responded to input from rudder pedals but deflected uncommandedly to the left.PH-DYM off the runway (Photo: DSB):
A China Eastern Airlines Airbus A320-200, registration B-2221 performing flight MU-2772 from Changchun to Dalian (China), rejected takeoff at low speed (about 10 knots) when the right hand engine (CFM56) produced a loud noise, the aircraft began to veer right and the right hand engine lost power. The airplane slowed safely, the crew shut the right hand engine down and returned to the apron.The American NTSB reported China's Civil Aviation Administration is investigating.
A Kulula Boeing 737-400, flight MN-517 from Lanseria to Durban (South Africa), rejected takeoff from Lanseria at low speed when the circuit breaker for the landing lights popped. The airplane slowed safely and returned to the apron.Following repair the airplane departed again a short time later.A passenger reported the engines were just accelerating for takeoff when the takeoff was rejected about 5 seconds into the roll. The captain subsequently explained the circuit breaker for the headlights had popped, the circuit breaker was subsequently replaced and the airplane departed again.
An Air France Airbus A319-100, registration F-GRHO performing flight AF-2333 from Athens (Greece) to Paris Charles de Gaulle (France) with 113 people on board, had departed Athen's runway 03R when the crew reported a bird strike had occurred during the takeoff roll. The crew levelled off at 8000 feet and returned to Athens for a safe landing on runway 03L about 30 minutes after departure.The airplane was able to depart again and reached Paris with a delay of 2 hours.
A Delta Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-88, registration N986DL performing flight DL-352 from Grand Cayman (Cayman Islands) to Atlanta,GA (USA) with 138 passengers and 5 crew, rejected takeoff from Grand Cayman at low speed when the right hand engine (JT8D) emitted a bang and lost power. The airplane slowed safely and returned to the gate.The flight was subsequently cancelled, the passengers taken to hotels and rebooked onto flights the following day.Cayman Island's Civil Aviation Authority reported that the right hand engine suffered substantial damage. Debris was found scattered across 1500 feet of runway forcing the closure of the runway for about 4 hours until all debris was recovered.Delta reported that the crew rejected takeoff at low speed following an abnormal indication for the right hand engine. The engine received internal damage.

A First Air Boeing 737-200, registration C-GNWN performing flight 7F-300 from Winnipeg,MB to Rankin Inlet,NU (Canada), rejected takeoff from Winnipeg's runway 31 at high speed after the crew received a low power indication for the #1 engine (JT8D, left hand). The airplane slowed safely and returned to the apron.The Canadian TSB reported that maintenance found ice on the engine's PT2 probe.
A Flyant Cargo Boeing 737-300 on behalf of Agroar, registration EC-KDJ performing a freight flight from Funchal to Lisbon (Portugal) with 2 crew, had backtracked and lined up runway 05 in light rain. After receiving takeoff clearance the crew accelerated the engines to 55% N1, let the engines stabilize at 55% n1 and then applied TOGA on autothrust, when the engines did not spool up symmetrically with the left engine accelerating to 88% N1 and the right hand engine remaining at 67% N1, the aircraft started to skid to the right, the crew disconnected the autothrottle and reduced engine thrust after which control was regained. The airplane skidded until reaching the runway safety shoulder where the left main gear hit and damaged a runway edge light. The crew taxied back to the apron, the crew satisfied with the performance of the aircraft decided to proceed with the flight and taxied out again for takeoff runway 05, during taxi the captain spotted the damaged runway edge light and considering the edge light might have been damaged by their runway excursion decided to return to the apron again where impact marks were found on the outboard left main gear tyre. The wheel was replaced before the airplane finally departed with the autothrust system de-activated.Portugals Gabinete de Prevencao e Investigacao de Acidentes com Aeronaves (GPIAA) released their final report concluding:Primary cause for this incident was the asymmetrical activity of Autothrottle system, which caused engine #1 power increase greater than engine #2, forcing the aircraft to veer to the right.The following were considered as Contributory factors:- The presence of a light water film on runway, due recent rain;- The presence of dust particles on the runway;- The aircraft being on the painting marks of runway threshold;- The absence of grooving on that part of runway surface, with poor macrotexture;Rain water, combined with dust, formed a thin mud film on top of a smooth runway, in order to create a highly slippery surface. When asymmetrical engine power forced the aircraft to veer to the right, it started skidding, entering in a viscous hydroplaning situation. Without grooving to stop the hydroplaning phenomenon, the aircraft continued skidding until reaching runway safety shoulder, which was not so smooth, where tires got contact with surface and control was regained.The GPIAA reported, that the engines accelerated asymmetrically as soon as autothrust was engaged. The autothrust computer was subsequently de-activated and the airplane flown to Lisbon. The autothrust computer was removed from the aircraft and sent for investigation, the traces of the autothrust computer however were lost when the spares provider company went bankrupt. The GPIAA therefore was not able to examine the autothrust computer.The flight data recorder showed that both engines accelerated to approximately 55% N1 after the pilot flying advanced throttle levers. When the engines were stabled, TO/GA was selected activating the autothrust system. The left hand engine accelerated to 88% while the right hand engine accelerated to 67% and remained there. The pilot immediately brought the power levers to idle, however autothrottle did not disconnect and accelerated the engines again. Only after the pilot flying switched autothrottle off the engines were brought to idle.The flight data recorder showed the rudder was deflected 17 degrees to the right immediately when takeoff was initiated, returned to neutral and then deflected fully to the right remaining fully deflected even when the airplane turned left returning to the runway center line. The rudder would be ineffective at these speeds and nose gear steering prevail.The ground track of EC-KDJ (Graphics: GPIAA):Engine Acceleration (Graphics: GPIAA):
An Emirates Boeing 777-300, registration A6-EBC performing flight EK-46 from Frankfurt/Main (Germany) to Dubai (United Arab Emirates), rejected takeoff from Frankfurt's runway 18 at low speed when the left hand engine (GE90) emitted a loud bang and streaks of flame. The airplane slowed safely and stopped about half way down runway 18.The aircraft remained on the ground for 32 hours before the aircraft departed for Dubai.
An Emirates Airlines Boeing 777-300, registration A6-EBQ performing flight EK-60 from Hamburg (Germany) to Dubai (United Arab Emirates), was cleared to line up runway 23 and wait, tower advised traffic was landing on crossing runway 15. The crew however started their takeoff run and were immediately ordered to stop which they complied with but not without penetrating the protected area of runway 15. The tower therefore ordered the Scandivanian Airlines Canadair CRJ-900, registration OY-KFG performing flight SK-649 from Copenhagen (Denmark) to Hamburg, to go around. The Emirates Boeing departed a few minutes later, the Scandinavian CRJ landed safely on their second approach.Excerpt of Aerodrome Chart (Graphics: AVH/AIP Germany):
Fracture surface (Photo: GCAA)An Ayk Avia Ilyushin IL-76TD, registration EK-76754 performing a freight flight from Sharjah (United Arab Emirates) to an unnamed destination, rejected takeoff from Sharjah's runway 12 after severe vibration was felt. The airplane slowed safely, stopped on the runway and subsequently returned to the apron.The General Civil Aviation Authority of the United Arab Emirates (GCAA) released their final report concluding the probable cause of the incident was:The Investigation Department determined that the probable cause of the Ayk Avia Airline aborted takeoff incident was the fracture and disintegration of left hand inboard aft wheel due to progressive undetected fatigue stress. The cause of why the fatigue was undetected is not determined.The GCAA reported, that the vibrations started when the airplane accelerated through 65 knots, the aircraft reached a maximum speed of 84 knots before slowing down.A visual inspection revealed, that the hub of the inner left hand aft main wheel had disintegrated and its tyre had separated coming to rest about 100 meters from the aircraft's stop point on the runway. The surface of the hub fracture showed two areas, one area indicating fatigue and the other showing overstress properties.The GCAA annotated that the cockpit voice recorder did not contain recordings of the incident flight, and the flight data recorder did not store vertical acceleration, vibration levels, airspeed and the engine #3's N1. The wire that had separated from the inner aft left main wheel was found about 100 meters before the final stop point of the aircraft, the tyre had separated while the wheel was spinning at high speed.Examination of the hub showed, that it had circumferential fracture of the outboard part except for a portion of 15%. The rim fractured into 5 pieces. The fracture surface showed properties of fatigue cracking, the length of the cracks suggesting the cracks were old enough, that a non-destructive regular maintenance examination should have detected the cracks long before the fracture.6 safety recommendations were made, 2 of them to the operator requiring the operator to ensure proper operation of the black boxes and improve their wheel hub inspection programme.The fractured wheel (Photo: GCAA):
A Spirit Airlines Airbus A320-200, registration N602NK performing flight NK-892 from Orlando,FL to Detroit,MI (USA) with 148 passengers, rejected takeoff from Orlando's runway 18L at high speed about 90 seconds after receiving their takeoff clearance, slowed safely and vacated the runway. The crew subsequently reported they rejected takeoff because of a hot brakes indication but did not need any assistance.The aircraft was able to depart again and reached Detroit with a delay of 7:20 hours.
A Westjet Boeing 737-700, registration C-FWAQ performing flight WS-453 from Montreal,QC to Toronto,ON (Canada), rejected takeoff from Montreal's runway 28 at high speed reporting some cockpit indication. The crew subsequently requested emergency services to attend the aircraft due to hot brakes. Following inspection by emergency services the aircraft taxied to the apron about 15 minutes after rejecting takeoff.A replacement Boeing 737-700 registration C-FKWS reached Toronto with a delay of 3 hours.
An Air Macau Airbus A321-200, registration B-MAR performing flight NX-1 from Beijing to Macau (China), rejected takeoff from Beijing at low speed when a large fluid spill became visible from the right hand wing during engine acceleration. The airplane slowed safely.Observers on the ground said, there was a fierce fuel spray from the right hand wing.Passengers reported they noticed a massive spray of fluid from the right hand wing, almost simultaneously the airplane began to slow. The airplane stopped on the runway and was evacuated.The airport confirmed the rejected takeoff stating that the operation of their runways was not affected. The airplane underwent repairs and departed about 7.5 hours later with a total delay of 9 hours.The airline reported the airplane suffered an oil leak through a seal. The passengers disembarked for the necessary repairs. The airplane subsequently underwent a number of tests and was released to flight reaching Macau with a delay of 9 hours.On Feb 8th the airline said, it was a fuel spill. The aircraft had been involved in an engine fire during a ground run on Jan 31st 2011, the engine had been replaced.Macau's Civil Aviation Authority is investigating.
The FAA released Airworthiness Directive AD-2011-03-14 requiring all Boeing 737-100, -200, -300, -400 and -500 types to install two additional warning lights, one for takeoff configuration and one for cabin altitude warning, and introduce updated documentation within 36 months following March 14th 2011.The FAA argues the AD is introduced to "prevent failure of the flightcrew to recognize and react properly to a valid cabin altitude warning horn, which could result in incapacitation of the flightcrew due to hypoxia (lack of oxygen in body), and consequent loss of control of the airplane."On Aug 14th 2005 the crew of Helios Airways flight 522 had misinterpreted the cabin altitude warning horn as a configuration alert (same horn, on the ground a configuration alert, airborne a cabin altitude warning) which ultimately resulted in the crash of their Boeing 737-300 near Athens (Greece).The FAA estimate the modification requires 20 work hours plus material resulting in a cost of 4,438 US$ per aircraft or 3.3 million US$ for the affected 741 Boeing 737 aircraft on US register.
An Belair Airbus A320-200 on behalf of Air Berlin, registration HB-IOQ performing flight AB-8715 from Zurich (Switzerland) to Hamburg (Germany), rejected takeoff from Zurich's runway 28 at low speed after the crew received an ECAM message indicating a hydraulic failure.

A Fly540 (Uganda) Fokker 27-500 Friendship, registration 5X-FFD performing a test flight from Nairobi's Wilson Airport to Nairobi's Wilson Airport (Kenya) with 4 crew, accelerated for takeoff on runway 14 when the crew decided to reject takeoff due to some mechanical malfunction. The aircraft overran the end of the runway, broke through the airport's perimeter fence and went down a slope before coming to a stop in a field with the nose gear collapsed. No injuries occurred, the 4 crew were taken to a local hospital for checks however, the aircraft that had just undergone maintenance received substantial damage.Wilson's longest runway 14/32 is 1540 meters/5050 feet long.Metars (from nearby Jomo Kenyatta International Airport):HKJK 272300Z 01005KT CAVOK 15/08 Q1021 NOSIGHKJK 272200Z 01006KT CAVOK 15/07 Q1022 NOSIGHKJK 272100Z 02006KT CAVOK 16/08 Q1022 NOSIGHKJK 272000Z 04008KT CAVOK 17/08 Q1022 NOSIGHKJK 271900Z 06006KT CAVOK 19/08 Q1021 NOSIGHKJK 271800Z 03008KT 9999 FEW020 20/07 Q1021 NOSIG HKJK 271700Z 05010KT 9999 FEW023 22/06 Q1019 NOSIG HKJK 271600Z 06015KT 9999 FEW025 SCT090 24/05 Q1018 NOSIG HKJK 271500Z 07018KT 9999 FEW028 26/03 Q1017 NOSIG HKJK 271400Z 06021KT 9999 FEW029 M01 Q1017 NOSIGHKJK 271300Z 06019KT 9999 FEW029 27/03 Q1017 NOSIG HKJK 271200Z 06022KT 9999 FEW029 27/06 Q1018 NOSIG HKJK 271000Z 06021KT 9999 FEW028 26/08 Q1019 NOSIG HKJK 270900Z 05018KT 9999 FEW026 24/07 Q1020 NOSIG HKJK 270800Z 04019KT 9999 FEW025 24/09 Q1020 NOSIG HKJK 270700Z 05014KT CAVOK 21/06 Q1021 NOSIGHKJK 270600Z 05012KT CAVOK 20/08 Q1021 NOSIGHKJK 270500Z 02004KT CAVOK 17/06 Q1021 NOSIGHKJK 270400Z 33006KT CAVOK 13/07 Q1019 NOSIGHKJK 270300Z 34005KT CAVOK 13/07 Q1019 NOSIGHKJK 270200Z 36006KT CAVOK 13/07 Q1018 NOSIGHKJK 270100Z 36005KT CAVOK 13/08 Q1018 NOSIGHKJK 270000Z 36006KT CAVOK 14/07 Q1018 NOSIGHKJK 262300Z 33004KT CAVOK 15/08 Q1019 NOSIGHKJK 262200Z 36005KT CAVOK 15/08 Q1019 NOSIGMap (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):
The South Korean Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB) released their final report concluding:Findings related to probable causesFlight 950 maintained level flight at 7,000 after takeoff, and as it started climbing again the pitch attitude was lifted to a climbing angle exceeding the braking capability of the cart during in-flight service. Consequently, the cart slid and hit a seat when the hot water on the cart spilt over the passenger in the seat.Findings related to risk- The flight crew members were not aware that a pitch attitude would exceed the braking capability of the in-flight service cart when the aircraft climbed again after maintaining level flight at 7,000 feet.- When the in-flight service cart slid, both of cabin attendants in charge were away from the cart.- The departments in charge of production/management of the carts for in-flight service did not provide the departments of flight operations and cabin with information on the operational limitations of the carts.- Hot beverages were set on the top of the in-flight service cart.Others Findings- The flight crew members of Flight 950 held certificates of qualification proper to the relevant flight and were not assigned with excessive work load or flight.- The aircraft of Flight 950 held valid airworthiness certificate and operational limit designation, took off with proper fuel loaded and was within the limitations of weight and balance.- Turbulence was not encountered at the time of this accident.- Because B747 of Japan Airlines takes off with the seat belt sign switch set at AUTO position, the seat belt sign is to be turned off automatically when the aircraft climbs above 10,000 feet.- The captain of Flight 950 turned off the seat belt sign after reaching 7,000 feet level flight to secure sufficient time for cabin service.- The brake system of the cart was applied when the upper deck cabin attendants were away from the cart.- The Cabin Attendant Safety Manual and Cabin Service Manual did not specify a standard about leaving the cart during service.- When the in-flight service carts were manufactured, the brake capability specification was 8°, and it was maintained up to 10.7° in the actual test.According to the weather forecasts the crew received during the briefing for the flight, the weather near Japan was bad. The captain therefore asked cabin crew what time they would need to conclude the passenger meal service.Subsequently the aircraft had departed Seoul's runway 15R with 314 passengers and 16 crew and had been cleared to climb to 7000 feet. After reaching 7000 feet and levelling off the captain turned the fasten seat belt sign off (usual JAL procedure would be to turn the fasten seat belt sign off climbing through 10000 feet), no objection was raised by the first officer.Cabin crew noticed that the fasten seat belt sign was turned off earlier than usual, nonetheless began preparations for meal service. About 4 minutes later the two flight attendants working the upper desk brought a cart with beverages and meals into the aisle adjacent to seat rows 16. One attendant was serving beverages to the passengers in row 15, while the other went to the galley to fetch a sticker ("please let us know when you wake up") for a sleeping passenger. The cart's brakes were applied.About 4 minutes after levelling off at 7000 feet the flight was cleared to climb to FL230. Leaving VNAV SPD mode active and without turning the fasten seat belt sign off the crew selected the new altitude into the autopilot resuming the "altitude climb". The autopilot pitched the aircraft up beyond the brake capability of the service carts. The cart in the upper aisle near row 16 started to slide, hit seat 19H and tumbed towards seat 19C spilling the hot beverage on the cart onto the right arm of the passenger seated in 19C seriously injuring the passenger.Cabin crew reported, that the passenger was complaining of pain. She went to the passenger, verified that the passenger had received burns with blisters already visible and provided first aid using an ice bag and cold insulation on the passenger's right arm where blisters were seen.The senior cabin attendant judged that the passenger needed medical assistance after arrival in Tokyo, informed the flight deck accordingly. An according ACARS message was sent to dispatch by the first officer. After arrival in Tokyo the passenger was taken to a hospital, where second degree burns were diagnosed (establishing a serious injury).The service cart, empty weight 48lbs, maximum loadable weight 152lbs, was tested for brakes holding the cart loaded up to 200lbs and 8 degrees of pitch at the time of manufacture.The flight data recorder showed that the airplane reached a maximum pitch angle of 11.7 degrees when the autopilot pitched up to climb from 7000 feet to FL230. At that point the airplane was doing 243 KIAS and reached a vertical speed of 3736 feet per minute.The ARAIB analysed that the captain expected the aircraft to be shaken while close to Japan. With all seats taken he wanted to ensure sufficient time for cabin service and therefore turned the fasten seat belt sign off early with consent by the first officer.The auto flight system would accelerate engines to climb thrust. Below 10000 feet the autopilot however would maintain a speed at or below 250 KIAS requiring higher pitch angles to maintain that speed than above FL100, where the airplane would need lesser pitch angles to maintain the substantially higher airspeed. The higher pitch angle below FL100 exceeded the braking capability of the service carts.The ARAIB analysed: "Such a result was caused by the captains failure to anticipate that a high pitch attitude occurs when climbing again after maintaining level flight below 10,000 feet. Although he turned the seat belt sign off earlier to secure sufficient service time for the cabin attendants, he was not aware of the fact that the cart for in-flight service was manufactured with braking capability maintainable only up to an 8° pitch."Selected parameters off the FDR (Graphics: ARAIB):
A Jetblue Airbus A320-200, registration N592JB performing flight B6-325 from Hartford,CT to Fort Lauderdale,FL (USA), rejected takeoff from Hartford's runway 33 at low speed due reporting an engine's (V2527) compressor vane fault. The airplane returned to the gate.The rotation B6-325/B6-326 was subsequently cancelled and the passengers were rebooked onto the next flights.
The crew of a Farnair Switzerland Avions de Transport Regional ATR-72-200 on behalf of UPS, freight flight FAT-6992 from Cologne (Germany) to Katowice (Poland), rejected takeoff from Cologne when the crew noticed white smoke from the cargo area and almost simultaneously fire alerts activated. The airplane slowed safely, responding emergency services found no trace of fire or heat leading to the suspicion that de-icing fluid had entered the air conditioning system.

The airplane came to a stop on the runway, no injuries occurred, the airplane however received substantial damage to the gear.A replacement aircraft reached Gaborone with a delay of 5.5 hours.The accident aircraft is estimated to be out of service for weeks.The left hand main gear after stand still (Photo: Aviator267):
A Virgin Blue Embraer ERJ-190, registration VH-ZPH performing flight DJ-1721 from Perth,WA to Karratha,WA (Australia), departed Perth's runway 21 when the aircraft ingested a bird into one of its engines (CF34) just prior to rotation. The crew continued the takeoff, levelled off at 3000 feet with both engines remaining operative and returned to runway 21 for a safe landing about 25 minutes after departure and taxied to the apron.The affected engine had a number of compressor blades bent by the bird.
An Egypt Air Airbus A321-200, registration SU-GBU performing flight MS-61 from Luxor to Cairo (Egypt) with 183 passengers, rejected takeoff from Luxor following a bird strike. The airplane slowed safely and returned to the apron.The flight was subsequently cancelled.
A Qantas Boeing 747-400, registration VH-OJO performing flight QF-11 from Sydney,NS (Australia) to Los Angeles,CA (USA) with 344 passengers, was accelerating on Sydney's runway 34L when the crew rejected takeoff at low speed after the #1 engine (RB211, outer left) emitted a bang and streaks of flame were briefly visible. The airplane slowed safely and stopped on the runway. Tower reported seeing nothing unusual. Emergency services responded to check the aircraft out.Runway 34L was temporarily closed, aircraft on approach to 34L were redirected to 34R. The aircraft subsequently taxied back to the apron.A replacement Boeing 747-400 registration VH-OJL departed Sydney with a delay of 4.5 hours.
Tail damage (Photo: BFU)A Sky Airlines Boeing 737-800 on behalf of Air Memphis, registration TC-SKC performing flight MHS-520 from Stuttgart to Dusseldorf (Germany) with 89 passengers and 7 crew, was cleared for takeoff from Stuttgart's runway 25. During initial acceleration the airplane pitched up, the tail struck the runway surface, prompting the captain to reject takeoff at low speed. During deceleration the airplane pitched down again onto its nose gear, rolled out without further incident, vacated the runway and stopped on taxiway E, from where the airplane was towed to the gate. The passengers disembarked normally. A flight attendant received minor injuries, the airplane received substantial damage.Germany Bureau for Aviation Accident Investigation (BFU) released their final report in German concluding the probable cause of the serious incident was:the extreme aft position of the CG caused by the remaining passengers and their luggage all located in the rear of the aircraft.Contributing factor was the insufficient safety attitude of all involved except for the loadmaster.The BFU reported, that the airplane was scheduled to fly Hurghada-Dusseldorf-Stuttgart, the flight plan however was changed last minute to have the airplane fly Hurghada-Stuttgart-Dusseldorf. The airplane arrived with 189 passengers, 100 of which disembarked in Stuttgart. The remaining passengers, all seated in the rear of the aircraft, were not reseated.A flight attendant noticed the unusual seat distribution and asked the captain for advice, the captain however saw no need to take action.The load sheet produced for the aircraft showed weights and CG within limits, the actual load distribution however put the CG rear of the aft limit.The loadmaster of Stuttgart's load group observed the nose gear was fully extended, the tyre barely touching the ground, the tail unusually low, while the aircraft was still parked at the gate. He asked the ramp agent to check the load sheet again. The ramp agent received the reply from the office work that everything was in order and had no doubts.The loadmaster was then observing the aircraft as it taxied out and noticed that the nose gear was fully extended with the tyre barely making contact with the surface, in turns the nose gear drifted outwards because having nearly no ground contact in the loadmaster's opinion. The loadmaster informed the opoerations controller in charge. The operations controller could not see the aircraft from his position and assumed the airplane had already departed, he had no possibility to radio the crew.In the meantime the airplane reached runway 25 and was cleared for takeoff and suffered the tail strike. The BFU annotated, that recordings of the cockpit voice recorder suggested the crew had a similiar occurrence already on a previous flight, the necessity to reseat the passengers was well known to the crew.The captain (55, ATPL) had 12000 hours of flying experience total, 3000 hours on type. The first officer (46, ATPL) had 5200 hours total flying experience, 3000 hour on type.The computed takeoff weight was 54223 kg (119434 lbs), the CG was computed at 18.3% MAC (within limits), the trim setting was computed at +6.51 degrees. The loadsheet with these computations had 42 passengers seated in the front section of the aircraft.
An Air Canada Airbus A330-300, registration C-GHKW performing flight AC-850 from Calgary,AB (Canada) to London Heathrow,EN (UK) with 243 people on board, was cleared for takeoff from Calgary's runway 16. The crew accelerated the engines for takeoff, engine #1 (Trent 772, left hand) however experienced a compressor stall prompting the crew to reject takeoff at low speed and shut the engine down. The airplane subsequently taxied back to the apron.A replacement Airbus A330-300 registration C-GFAH reached London with a delay of 8 hours.The Canadian TSB reported that a borescopic inspection revealed 30 stage 5 high pressure compressor blades showed tip curl though within allowed limits. The aircraft was ground run with no fault found. A similiar event had already occurred on Jan 3rd while the airplane was taxiing for departure in Calgary (flight AC-850). Following the Jan 3rd occurrence the IP check valve and the electronic engine control were replaced, the fault codes persisted however. The intermediate and high pressure bleed valves were replaced, a borescopic inspection revealed no defects and the airplane was returned to service.

The separated access panel (Photo: BAA Southampton)A Flybe de Havilland Dash 8-400, registration G-JEDN performing flight BE-141 from Southampton,EN to Newcastle,EN (UK) with 40 passengers and 4 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Southampton when the inboard forward access door to engine #2 (PW150A) detached from the aircraft, collided with and damaged the leading edge of the right hand wing. The crew, unaware of the event, continued the takeoff. The crew of another aircraft parked on the apron saw a panel detaching from the accelerating aircraft and reported to ATC, who passed the information on. The aircraft continued to behave normally. Subsequently ATC advised that a panel and some other debris had been found on the airfield after which the captain decided to return to Southampton for a safe landing.The British Air Accident Investigation Board AAIB released their bulletin reporting, that the crew had arrived in good time before scheduled departure at 06:45L (05:45Z). The airplane had been parked over night. About 40 minutes prior to scheduled departure the crew walked around the aircraft, the commander reported that conditions were quite light and he didn't need a torch for the pre-flight inspection. He removed the engine blanks and stored them in the forward cargo hold, then verified amongst other preflight items that all engine access panels were closed. Having noticed some amount of melting frost on the airplane he ordered the airplane to be de-iced.The passenger embarked, the aircraft was de-iced, the de-icing crews moved around the aircraft, a member of the ground crew also walked around the aircraft and noticed no anomaly. The aircraft was pushed back and departed.Following the report of the other crew airport staff found the inboard forward right hand engine access door in the grass area about halfway down the runway and to the east of the runway. The two center latches were fully closed and locked, however the two lower latches were fully open. Examination of the latch pin receivers showed no evidence of the pins having been forced out of their locked position. All 4 quick release positive-lock pins were found serviceable with no indication that the pins had been engaged immediately prior to the engine access panel separating from the aircraft.The #1 engine outboard forward access door and the #2 engine inboard forward access door permit access to the engine's oil system. The airplane was based in Southampton, a daily check and an unscheduled maintenance task was carried out over night. One of the first tasks on the daily check was to check the engine oil quantities. This task requires the #1 outboard forward and the #2 inboard forward access panels to be opened. The evidence suggests that the #2 access panel had not been fully latched following the maintenance work.The operator took a safety action launching a safety campaign highlighting the importance of securing and checking of engine access doors on all aircraft types to all their aircrew, engineering and ground staff.
An Air Canada Jazz Canadair CRJ-100, registration C-FVKR performing flight QK-7674 from Montreal,QC to Charlottetown,PE (Canada) with 46 people on board, rejected takeoff from Montreal's runway 28 at low speed (50-60 KIAS) because of smoke in the cabin and flight deck. The airplane slowed safely, the smoke dissipated after engines spooled down. Responding emergency services found no trace of fire, heat or smoke. The airplane taxied back to the gate, the passengers disembarked normally.The Canadian TSB reported that the airplane had been de-iced prior to departure. It is likely that de-icing fluid was ingested into the aircraft bleed system.

A TUIFly Boeing 737-800, registration D-AHFK performing flight X3-6126 from Hurghada (Egypt) to Hanover (Germany), rejected takeoff from Hurghada at low speed due to a fault message concerning the spoilers. The airplane slowed safely and returned to the apron.A passenger reported, that the engines were delivering takeoff thrust for about 10 seconds before the takeoff was rejected and the airplane returned to the gate. While maintenance attempted to repair the aircraft, the passengers waited about 2 hours in the airplane and another 2 hours in the departure lounge of the airport, before they were taken to hotels. The captain later explained, that they had received a fault indication for the spoilers requiring spare parts and mechanics to be flown in from Hanover. A valve was replaced before D-AHFK departed the following day (Dec 3rd) taking the passengers and the engineer back to Hanover.The airplane reached Hanover with a delay of 20 hours.
A THY Turkish Airlines Boeing 777-300, registration TC-JJC performing flight TK-60 (scheduled departure Dec 3rd) from Istanbul Ataturk (Turkey) to Bangkok (Thailand) with 284 passengers and 14 crew, had lined up for departure on runway 17L and was waiting for takeoff clearance when the crew received a fire indication for the rear cargo hold and a burning smell developed in the rear of the cabin. The crew initiated an evacuation via slides, during which 30 passengers received minor injuries. Responding emergency services found no trace of fire, heat or smoke.The runway was closed for about 90 minutes.A replacement Boeing 777-300 registration TC-JJD reached Bangkok with a delay of 8:15 hours.

A Cathay Pacific Airbus A340-300, registration B-HXE performing flight CX-839 from Vancouver,BC (Canada) to Hong Kong (China) with 274 people on board, had departed Vancouver. When the crew selected the flaps up, the flaps remained stuck in the takeoff position, the crew worked the according checklists but was unable to retract the flaps. The crew therefore dumped fuel and returned to Vancouver for a safe landing on runway 08R. The Canadian TSB reported that maintenance discovered a fault on the right hand flap strut sensor caused by ice formation on the sensor. The ice was removed, the flap control computer was replaced and the aircraft returned to service.The airplane departed again as flight CX-839D about 5 hours after first departure.
A Southern Air Transport Boeing 747-200 freighter on behalf of Malaysian Airlines, registration N758SA performing flight MH-6145 from Frankfurt/Main (Germany) to Tashkent (Uzbekistan), rejected takeoff from Frankfurt's runway 18 after engine #3 (CF6, inner right) suffered an uncontained failure and slowed safely. The airplane received substantial damage.An observer on the ground reported, that debris from the engine penetrated the right hand wing, leading edge flaps, trailing edge flaps and the gear doors prompting the observer to say they "look like Swiss Cheese".The German Bureau for Aviation Accident Investigation (BFU) reported in their status report in German on Nov 19th 2010, that the EGT indication of engine #3 had significantly fluctuated during engine start and finally fell to zero, so that the crew shut the engine down again. Engineers identified a loose connector, subsequently engine #3 was started again and now showed an EGT indication which varied only by a few degrees C.Following takeoff clearance the crew accelerated the engines to about 70% N1. The flight engineer reported that the generator #3 showed a warning light, the captain therefore pulled all thrust levers to idle, but engines #3 and #4 did not respond and continued to run at above 70% N1. At that time the flight engineer noticed the right hand wing overtemperature indication had illuminated prompting the captain to tell ATC that their takeoff would need to be delayed. The crew of another aircraft observed smoke and fire underneath the B742 and alerted ATC, the tower informed the B742 crew. In the meantime the first officer discovered some orange glow underneath the right hand wing. The captain therefore shut all engines down using the fire handles and ordered the evacuation of the aircraft. All 4 crew on board disembarked via the electronic compartment. Responding emergency services did not find any fire.The captain (29) had 3800 hours of flying experience, 1100 on type, the first officer (55) had 9400 hours of flying experience thereof 1270 on type, the flight engineer (47) had about 10000 hours of flying experience thereof 4600 on type.Engine #3's tech log showed an EGT check on Jun 15th 2010, on Aug 20th the resistor values of the EGT probes were measured, and on Aug 31st a boroscopic examination of the high pressure turbine stage 1 and 2 had been conducted, all examinations showing no anomalies.An examination of the engine showed that turbine disks 3 and 4 of the low pressure turbine had fractured, the parts of both disks remained inside the engine. All blades had separated from those two disks. In the rear section of the engine there were a number of large holes, the stator between stage 3 and 4 of the low pressure turbine was completely missing. The aft cowling and the central body were separated from the engine.Engine parts impacted the aircraft in several locations. The underside of the right hand wing showed impact marks up to 4 millimeters (0.15 inches) deep. Several parts had gone through the pylon of engine #3.The control cables for engines #3 and #4 in the right hand wing were severed, as was the fire extinguishing tube of engine #3 and a cable harness above engine #3. Impact damage was also found on engines #2 (inboard left hand) and #4, the belly fairing, the flaps, the ailerons and their cowlings. Tyres and brake lines on the right hand main gear were damaged.A boroscopic inspection of the engine found no damage in the compressor, however about half a blade was missing from the first stage of the high pressure turbine. The blades of the second stage showed erosion damage at the tips.No fire damage was found.The NTSB had released a safety recommendation on May 27th 2010 recommending a boroscopic inspection of the high pressure turbine every 15 flight cycles. In June 2010 the FAA released an Air Worthiness Directive AD-2010-12-10 requiring a boroscopic inspection of the high pressure turbine stage 1 and stage 2 blades, an EPR system check and engine trend monitoring every 75 flight cycles. That activity was the result of investigations into 4 occurrences, where the low pressure turbine disks 3 and/or 4 had separated as result of damages in the high pressure turbine.General Electric, the engine manufacturer, released 4 service bulletin between May and August 2010 as result of the investigations.Engine #3 left hand side (Photo: BFU):Engine #3 right hand side (Photo: BFU):Impact marks on underside of right hand wing (Photo: BFU):Missing half blade in high pressure turbine stage 1 (Photo: BFU):

A Pinnacle Airlines Canadair CRJ-200 on behalf of Delta Airlines, flight 9E-4086/DL-4086 from Minneapolis,MN to Wichita,KS (USA) with 43 passengers and 3 crew, rejected takeoff from runway 30R at high speed after passengers smelled smoke and a smoke detector triggered. The crew requested emergency services to attend the aircraft reporting a possible fire on board, vacated the runway and stopped on the parallel taxiway P.The airline reported, that de-icing fluid seeped into the air conditioning system causing the smell and the smoke detector to trigger. Some haze appeared in the cabin. The passengers deplaned onto the runway and were bussed to the apron.A replacement CRJ-200 registration N813AY reached Wichita with a delay of 2 hours.
An Air North Boeing 737-200, registration C-FJLB performing flight 4N-505 from Whitehorse,YT to Vancouver,BC (Canada), was accelerating through about 80 knots for takeoff when crew and passengers experienced significant yaw and vibrations accompanied by several loud bangs. The crew rejected the takeoff and came to a safe stop, the aircraft was inspected on the runway. The inspection revealed the right hand engine's (JT8D) compressor nose cone/bullet had become displaced, both engines were shut down and the aircraft was towed to the apron.The Canadian TSB reported, that a closer inspection showed the bullet had stripped and snapped from its mount, there was visible damage to the compressor blades.Maintenance reported, that the crew heard bangs typical of a compressor stall and the right hand engine lost power. After the takeoff was rejected maintenance found the extended nose dome had detached from the number 1 bearing support assembly due to stripped threads and a broken casting. The nose dome swung to the right, pierced the nose cowl inner acoustic liner and disrupted the airflow into the engine. Minor damage occurred to the stage 1 compressor blades and around the circumference of the stage 2 noise abatement liner. The nose dome had not been checked during preflight inspection as is usually done. On Nov 9th the nose dome had been found loose requiring to be tightened.

Airbus and Rolls Royce have ordered all operators using Trent 900 engines on Airbus A380-800s to have their engines inspected immediately before the next takeoff.This comes after an uncontained failure of a Qantas Trent 972, see Accident: Qantas A388 near Singapore on Nov 4th 2010, uncontained engine failure.Singapore Airlines have already announced all their A380 flights will be delayed as result of these inspections.Lufthansa reported, they couldn't complete the recommended engine inspections in time for flight LH-572 from Frankfurt (Germany) to Johannesburg (South Africa), so that an Airbus A340-600 will now perform the flight on schedule. The airline pledges that all other A388 flights will be on schedule.Qantas reported on Nov 8th that during such checks, each lasting 8 hours per engine, three engines with slight anomalies were identified, there was oil at locations where no oil should be. "We are trying to check what the cause of that could be. These are new engines on new aircraft and they should not have these issues at this stage, so this has given us an indication of an area for us to focus on."Singapore Airlines said on Nov 10th, that they are going to change engines on three of their 11 A380-800s as a precaution after "oil stains" have been discovered. The oil stains are different from the oil leakage discovered in the Qantas engines. The three aircraft are being flown back to Singapore from London, Melbourne and Sydney for the engine changes. Flight SQ-228 from Melbourne to Singapore on Nov 10th was cancelled, the Airbus A380-800 registration 9V-SKC took off for Singapore at 15:30L (04:30Z) as flight SQ-228F. Flight SQ-222 from Sydney on Nov 10th, A388 9V-SKJ, although not cancelled - Singapore Airport shows the flight as "retimed" - departed 87 minutes early at 15:03L (04:03Z) with news agency Reuters reporting the flight does not carry passengers. Flight SQ-321 from London on Nov 9th, A388 9V-SKA, departed with a delay of 3.5 hours on Nov 10th.Lufthansa confirmed on Nov 10th that they changed one of their Trent 970 engines on one of their Airbus A380-800s purely as a precaution. There is no link to the problems identified with the Qantas engines.

Engine being foamed (Photo: farrylpurkiss)A 1time McDonnell Douglas MD-82, registration ZS-TRE performing flight 1T-119 from Johannesburg to Cape Town (South Africa) with 128 passengers, rejected takeoff from Johannesburg's runway 03L at low speed after the left hand engine (JT8D) emitted a loud bang and the crew received an excessive EGT indication. The airplane slowed safely, vacated the runway and taxied towards the terminal when the tower advised the engine released a lot of smoke, responding emergency services reported the engine on fire. The airplane stopped and was evacuated through both front doors, while emergency services foamed the engine. 11 passengers received injuries.Runway 03L was closed temporarily.The airline reported, that the left hand engine lost power during takeoff prompting the crew to reject the takeoff however no actual fire had occurred and the crew received no engine fire indication. Due to the report by emergency services of a possible engine fire the captain decided to perform an emergency evacuation. The airline said first inspection of the engine showed the engine failure was the result of a foreign object ingestion (possibly bird strike). Five passengers are under medical observation, no serious injuries occurred.The airport reported 11 passengers received injuries during the evacuation, 6 of which were taken to a hospital. A passenger claimed to have suffered a broken arm as result of the evacuation.
An Aserca Airlines Douglas DC-9-30, registration YV368T performing flight R7-748 from Caracas to Puerto Ordaz (Venezuela) with about 100 passengers, rejected takeoff at high speed from Caracas' runway 28 due to a blown tyre on the left hand main gear.

The British Air Accident Investigation Branch AAIB have released their Bulletin reporting, that both fan cowl doors of the right hand engine (CF34) went missing during takeoff from Jersey. Engineering rectification had been performed on the #2 hydraulic system and the latches on the fan cowl doors had not been fastened securely.The airplane received damage to the hinges and the engine cowling of the right hand engine and the leading edge slats of the right hand wing.The missing cowling doors and a number of other small pieces were recovered from about half way down the runway in Jersey. The hinges of both fan cowl doors were damaged, pieces of the torn away doors were still attached. No damages occurred at the latches and clamps indicating they were not engaged.The airplane had landed in Jersey with a complete loss of fluid from the #2 hydraulic system due to a leak from a pipe in the right hand engine pylon. Following the repairs the crew was to ferry the airplane to Birmingham. It was dark with no engineering personnel present when the crew began pre-flight preparations and performed the walk around. The engine cowl latches are underneath the engine and were not included in the walk around checklist. Maintenance reported the work had been completed and the airplane was ready to go.The flight to Birmingham appeared to be uneventful though the commander felt the airplane was a bit noisy, the first officer was not concerned. After landing the crew of another aircraft radioed the crew telling they should have a look at their right hand engine at their parking position. The commander followed the advise and found most of both fan cowl doors missing and reequested the runways in Birmingham and Jersey to be checked, after which the cowl fragments were recovered from Jersey airport about halfway down the runway.A maintenance engineer ("A") had been assigned to work the hydraulic system. The engine driven hydraulic pump (EDP) had been running for some time without hydraulic fluid and needed to be inspected requiring the engine doors to be opened. Upon completion of the examiniation the engineer had closed the cowl doors, but before applying the latches he was interrupted by a phone call. After finishing the phone call the engineer said his mind was focussed on the remaining structural examinations and "he forgot to lock the cowlings" before handing the aircraft to the next shift (engineer "B"). In this handover engineer "A" briefed, that the EDP inspection had been completed but the filters had not yet been checked.Engineer "B" noticed the open latches but assumed that further access was needed for the filter inspection (the filter are however located behind the wing/fuselage fairing aft of the trailing edge). He handed the airplane over to the next shift (engineer "C").Engineer "C" had worked closely with "A" for many years and was content to both sign off the EDP and his own work. He did not notice the open latches.The AAIB commented, that the cowl doors would appear to be closed hanging under their own weight so that no gap was visible with the cowling. This has producd other incidents (for example on A320s) where cowl doors had not been securely fastened and had been torn away on takeoff causing substantial damage to the aircraft. The engine manufacturer therefore had developed a modification to incorporat a spring loaded plunger preventing the door to close entirely unless the plunger was manually pushed clear.The AAIB analysed that the primary cause of the latches remaining open was the interruption of engineer "A" by the phone call. However three more opportunities to catch the open latches were missed too:- engineer "B" noticed the open latches but assumed further work was needed and "C" would take care of the latches. - engineer "C" completed the filter check, assumed "A" had closed the latches and was content to sign off the work he had not accomplished himself- the captain performed the walk around but did not notice the open latches. The walk around checklist mentioned "check access panels are secured" but this did not explicitely mention the engine cowls.The operator changed procedures as a result of the occurrence requiring engineers to make a tech log entry every time the latches are being opened. That entry needs to be signed off after the latches have been securely closed again.All three engineers received additional training to reinstate the necessity to raise continuation sheets in the technical log or use task cards to ensure work is carried out correctly. The Jersey maintenance station manager was reminded of the need for formal handovers. A poster campaign was launched to highlight the issue of distraction and to remind maintenance personnel to have all panels and doors properly closed before dispatch.A notice to air crew was issued instructing crew to check for security of the engine cowl latches during pre-flight walk arounds.
An Iran Air Airbus A300-600, registration EP-IBA performing flight IR-720 from Frankfurt/Main (Germany) to Tehran Imam Khomeini (Iran) with 195 passengers and 13 crew, had diverted to Vienna (Austria) for a fuel stop.About an hour after landing in Vienna the airplane rejected takeoff from Vienna's runway 16 at high speed due to a fire indication for the right hand engine (CF6) and came to a stop about half way down the runway, the left hand main gear tyres deflated. The airplane remained disabled on the runway effectively closing the runway for about 5 hours.An observer on the ground reported a loud bang from an engine.The airport reported, that no debris was found on the runway.The passengers were taken to local hotels and were rebooked onto other Iran Air flights the following day (Oct 14th), that operated to Tehran via a fuel stop in Vienna.
The crew of a Porter Airlines de Havilland Dash 8-400, registration C-GLQG performing flight PD-250 from Ottawa,ON to Toronto City,ON (Canada), received an unlocked luggage door indication shortly after takeoff and worked the according checklist, then indicated they wanted to continue the flight. Subsequently the cabin pressurization system did not perform normally prompting the crew to declare PAN and return to Ottawa for a safe landing on runway 32 about 20 minutes after departure.The Canadian TSB reported, that the luggage door handle was found not properly engaged. This was corrected and the airplane returned to service.The airplane reached Toronto with a delay of 80 minutes.
Grey Crowned Crane (Photo: Tom Tarrant)A KLM Airbus A330-200, registration PH-AOB performing flight KL-562 from Entebbe (Uganda) to Amsterdam (Netherlands), ingested a bird into the right hand engine (CF6) shortly after takeoff from Entebbe and returned to Entebbe for a safe landing a few minutes later.The flight had to be cancelled. The passengers were rebooked onto other flights.Passengers reported, that they heard a loud bang just after the main wheels had left the runway. The Civil Aviation Authority of Uganda reported, the bird was identified to be a grey crowned crane populating the dry savannahs south of the Sahara. Adult birds are about 1 meter (3 feet) tall and weigh around 3.5kg (7.7lbs).Engine damage (Photo: Reuters/James Akena):
A China Airlines Airbus A340-300, registration B-18805 performing flight CI-62 from Frankfurt/Main (Germany) to Taipei (Taiwan), was in the takeoff roll on Frankfurt's runway 07L (length 4000 meters/13100 feet) about 2400 meters (1.3nm) down the runway about 61 seconds after receiving their takeoff clearance, when an arriving Lufthansa Cargo McDonnell Douglas MD-11, registration D-ALCD performing flight LH-8459 from Almaty (Kazakhstan) to Frankfurt/Main (Germany) received their late landing clearance for runway 07L, the transmission by the tower controller however was blocked by the transmission of another aircraft. At that time the MD-11 was descending through 200 feet AGL about 0.15nm ahead of the runway threshold. 9 seconds later the MD-11 crew queried "landing clearance?", at that point 240 meters (0.13nm) past the runway threshold, and immediately followed by a "pull up", at that point the distance between the two aircraft was 1700 meters (0.92nm). 10 seconds later the crew radioed they had gone around - the main gear had contacted with the runway surface - and were instructed to turn right onto a heading of 110 degrees and climb to 5000 feet. The departing Airbus continued the takeoff and reached destination safely, the arriving MD-11 landed safely following a second approach.The German BFU released their summarizing report in German without taking conclusions stating, that the tower controller (47) had been certified for tower control, radar service and flight information service in 1988. The MD-11 captain had more than 6000 hours flying experience, the MD-11 first officer more than 2300 hours. No data were available for the Airbus crew.According to the ground radar the minimal horizontal separation between the aircraft was 1700 meters (0.92nm).
An Aeroperlas Aerospatiale ATR-42-300, registration HP-004APP performing flight WL-482 from Panama City Paitilla to Bocas Del Toro (Panama) with 43 passengers and 4 crew, experienced the failure of the right hand engine (PW120) shortly after takeoff, smoke was observed from that engine. The crew shut the engine down and returned to Panama City's Paitilla Airport (also known as Albrook Airport) for a safe landing about 12 minutes after departure. The airplane stopped on the runway, passengers deplaned onto the runway and were bussed to the terminal. Passengers reported seeing flames out of the right hand engine.Panama's Civil Aviation Authority have opened an investigation into the incident.
A Singapore Airlines Airbus A340-500, registration 9V-SGD performing flight SQ-22 from Singapore (Singapore) to Newark,NJ (USA) with 81 passengers (business class only), dropped a left hand main wheel on takeoff from Singapore's Changi Airport. The crew continued the flight to Newark where the airplane landed safely on runway 04R about 18.5 hours after departure, emergency services were on standby. The airplane vacated the runway via taxiway L and taxied to the ramp.Singapore Airlines confirmed the gear damage saying, the wheel dropped during takeoff from Changi Airport and was later recovered from a drainage at the airport. After gear retraction the sensors signalled to the crew that one of the 12 main wheels was missing. At no point safety was compromised, the airplane is capable of landing on 11 wheels. An investigation has been initiated involving Airbus and the gear vendor to find out why the wheel dislodged.
An Air Canada Airbus A321-200, registration C-GJWD performing flight AC-100 from Vancouver,BC to Toronto,ON (Canada) with 181 people on board, rejected takeoff from Vancouver's runway 26L at about 125 KIAS after a hawk impacted the captain's upper left windshield, the crew declared PAN, the tower observed smoke from an engine. The airplane slowed safely and exited right onto taxiway H, responding emergency services checked the aircraft before the airplane taxied to the apron.A subsequent runway inspection recovered the dead bird. The runway was closed for about 10 minutes.A replacement Airbus A321 reached Toronto with a delay of 4:40 hours.The Canadian TSB reported maintenance performed a bird strike inspection and returned the aircraft to service.
A Lufthansa Cargo McDonnell Douglas MD-11, registration D-ALCH performing freight flight LH-8393 from Krasnojarsk (Russia) to Frankfurt/Main (Germany) with 3 crew and 95 tons of cargo, returned to Krasnojarsk following flaps problems after takeoff. The airplane landed safely about 2:20 hours after departure.The West Siberian Transport Prosecution Office reported, that the middle section of the right hand flaps could not be fully retracted after takeoff.The aircraft was able to complete the journey the following day with a total delay of 24 hours.
An Air Canada Airbus A330-300, registration C-GHKR performing flight AC-845 from Frankfurt/Main (Germany) to Calgary,AB (Canada), rejected takeoff from Frankfurt at high speed, the airplane slowed safely and returned to the apron.The aircraft was able to depart again and reached Calgary with a delay of 3.5 hours.According to passenger the captain announced there was an indicator malfunction. Maintenance subsequently replaced a computer. The new computer was tested and the airplane released to conduct the flight.

An American Airlines Boeing 777-200, registration N759AN performing flight AA-51 from London Heathrow,EN (UK) to Dallas Ft. Worth,TX (USA), rejected takeoff from Heathrow's runway 27R at low speed and was able to vacate the runway.An observer on the ground reported hearing a loud bang from an engine while the engines spooled up for takeoff, the aircraft slowed and vacated the runway onto taxiway A6.A replacement Boeing 777-200 registration N781AN departed London with a delay of 6:20 hours and reached Dallas via an intermediate stop in New York JFK,NY (USA) with a total delay of 11:15 hours.
An Atlas Blue Boeing 737-400, registration CN-RMX performing flight 8A-2091 from Metz (France) to Marrakesh (Morocco) with 170 passengers and 6 crew, departed Metz' runway 22, that was shortened to 2180 meters/7150 feet of takeoff distance available (regular takeoff distance 2775 meters/9100 feet) due to ongoing work at threshold runway 04. The main gear departed the runway after about 2400 meters roll distance, the airplane reached 35 feet AGL about 2600 meters from the runway threshold. About two hours later the airport informed the airline that the airplane had run over the temporary runway end lights and damage to the airframe could not be ruled out. In turn the crew was informed about the overrun while already on approach to Marrekesh and performed a safe precautionary landing with emergency services on stand by. No injuries occurred, the airplane received no damage.The French Bureau d'Enquetes et d'Analyses (BEA) released their final report in French concluding the probable cause of the incident was:Underestimation of risks, that are associated with the delay of supplement information that is not published anywhere else but substantially changes the operational requirements, by the actors in the development of aeronautical information. This resulted in that supplement information not being available to a number of crews operating into Metz during May 2006. The organisation of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation does not facilitate the rapid transmission of information supplied by aeronautical advisors to the AIP service.Contributing to the overrun were a slow rotation at less than 3 degrees/second and partial application of brakes during the takeoff run.Following discussions starting in 2005 the airport operator was advised in March 2006, that changes to the AIP (aeronautical information package) needed to be submitted 6 weeks prior to the release of the according AIRAC cycle for timely inclusion with the AIP (AIRAC cycle released on May 11th). Several documents were exchanged between the airport operator and the AIP managers. On April 6th the AIP manager requested additional information to complete the supplement and set a final date of April 10th. The information was submitted by April 10th, a draft was compiled and reviewed on April 13th, translated from French to English and subsequently submitted to be included with the AIRAC cyle of May 11th (less than 4 weeks prior to release of the cycle). Due to the time that supplement could not be merged anymore into the database for the AIRAC cycle of May 11th.A NOTAM was released on May 4th indicating that works would be in progress starting May 22nd 00:00Z and crews should refer to AIP SUP 56/06. On May 17th the original NOTAM indicating the supplement was replaced by a new NOTAM indicating work was beginning on May 21st 00:00Z and corrected some other information: LFJL B ) 0605210000 C) 0608312359E) WORKS IN PROGRESS ON RUNWAY 04/22:AIP SUP NR 056/06 REFERS.----------------------------------------------BEGINN ING OF WORKS: MAY 21ST, 2006 AT00H00 INSTEAD OF MAY 22ND, 2006.-------------------------------------------------------------------HAND AMEND THE AIP SUP NR 056/06 :PAGE 1 (PARAGRAPH 1.2.2) : READ  NEWEXTREMITY 04: DISPLACEMENT OF 550M INTHE SOUTH (INSTEAD OF MORE THAN 550MFROM THE END PRIOR TO THE WORK)PAGE 2 (MINIMA TABLE) :COLUMN 6 : READ RVR CAT C 1800(INSTEAD OF 1500) AND RVR CAT D 2000(INSTEAD OF 1500).No NOTAM stated the actual LDA (landing distance available)/TODA (takeoff distance available) or other information that should have been released with the supplement, the information therefore was not available to crews.The crew had approached Metz arriving from Marrakesh. During the approach ATIS indicated that there were works ongoing south of the airfield, runway 22 was in use, the runway was wet. Tower subsequently cleared the crew to land on runway 22, winds 190 at 10, runway is wet, 2100 meters available. The information was not repeated, the crew does not correctly understand the information and thought it was an information about visibility. The airplane touched down and rolled out safely and vacated the runway via taxiway C about 1800 meters down the runway.The crew subsequently performed departure preparations on the base of available aeronautical information, which indicated takeoff distance available was 2775 meters. The crew who was not in possession of the aeronautical supplement planned for a reduced thrust takeoff computing the takeoff weight at 64.2 tons, V1=150 KIAS, Vr=160 KIAS, V2=166 KIAS for a flap setting of 5 degrees. Target N1 was computed at 93.4%.The airplane subsequently taxied to and lined up on runway 22, the first officer took control of the aircraft as pilot flying. Holding the brakes he accelerated the engines to 75% N1, 12 seconds later the engines reached full target thrust at a speed of 60 KIAS. About 2100 meters down the runway the nose gear lifted off the runway at a speed of 167 KIAS, 3 seconds later the main wheels become airborne about 2400 meters down the runway, about 2600 meters down the runway the airplane reached 35 feet AGL and the gear lever was selected up. The airplane had rotated at an average pitch rate of 1.5 degrees/second.About two hours later the airport sent a message to the airline stating, that the airplane had run over and damaged the temporary runway end lights, damage to the airframe could not be ruled out. The airline in turn informed the crew.The BEA analysed, that the actual takeoff distance with engines at maximum takeoff thrust would have been 2101 meters very close to the TODA of 2180 meters. However, the crew was not aware of the reduced runway length, had not noticed the ongoing work and was not in possession of the supplement data and therefore performed a reduced thrust takeoff which was completed in 2600 meters. The English version of the NOTAM was unclear. The crew did not understand the ATIS message as reduced runway length but interpreted the 2100 meters mentioned as a reference to visibility.The BEA voiced serious concern that France does not have a plan regarding preparing, programming and coordinating work on an airfield and regarding dissemination of information unlike the United States. Several of the time mismatches resulted from the fact, that the schedule was meant ahead of the release of the AIRAC cycle and not the actual commencement of work (difference 11 days), which resulted in submission of documents more than a week past the actual due dates (actual due date was March 31st).In addition, the commencement of works one day earlier than planned contributed that information sent out did not reach the crews in time. Neither organisation in charge of dissemination of information and overviewing safety of operations questioned the beginning of works despite the information not having been included with the AIP and neither organisation published the information at least via NOTAMs.The ATIS message was analysed insufficient and not clear enough.
Scrape marks after tailstrike (Photo: BEA)A Tunisair Boeing 737-600, registration TS-IOK performing flight TU-437 from Paris Orly (France) to Tozeur (Tunisia) with 99 passengers and 6 crew, was accelerating for takeoff from Orly's runway 08 (takeoff distance available 3320 meters/10900 feet) in calm winds and a temperature of +9 degrees Centigrade when the airplane began to rotate before V1. The tail struck the runway, the aircraft became airborne below V1 and reached 12 feet AGL when the captain decided to reject the takeoff. The airplane touched down again, stopped within the runway and taxied back to the apron.The French Bureau d'Enquetes et d'Analyses (BEA) released their final report in French concluding the probable cause of the incident was:the premature rotation by the captain at very low speed. Lack of communication between the captain and first officer, which did not allow the crew to become aware of the inappropriate action at a critical stage of flight, contributed to the premature rotation.The BEA reported, that the captain was pilot flying, the first officer pilot monitoring. The crew computed the takeoff performance for a takeoff weight of 57.4 tons (actual takeoff weight 57,351 kg), takeoff flaps set at 1, a assumed temperature of +48 degrees C and a reduced takeoff thrust of 89.8% N1. Resulting V1=Vr was 127 KIAS, V2=133 KIAS, Vs at 117.8 KIAS, trim at 5.7. The FMS set the N1 target to 85%.While the airplane accelerated along runway 08 with N1 stabilized at 84.4%, the first officer called out 80 knots, the captain confirmed the cross check calling "checked". About one second later yoke control pressure is recorded commanding the nose up, airspeed was between 82 and 85 KIAS at that time. 8 seconds later the airplane reached a pitch angle of 16 degrees, the slats automatically deployed to their fully extended position, the airplane became airborne at a speed of 114 KIAS and the tail struck the runway. 5 seconds later the airplane reached a maximum height of 12 feet, the captain felt difficulty to control the airplane and rejected the takeoff pulling the thrust levers to idle. The airplane settled back onto the runway at a speed of 125 KIAS and a vertical acceleration of 1.4G about 2 second later and slowed safely within the runway applying ground spoilers and reverse thrust. No call out had been made by the first officer after the 80 knot call. The crew told the tower they rejected takeoff because of a disagreement between the air speed indicators.In postflight interviews the captain said, that there was a known problem with air speed indicators (ASI) on one of the fleet's aircraft and he thought it had been TS-IOK. The first officer however thought, the airplane with the known ASI problem was a different one. He saw about 90 KIAS on his ASI when the airplane rotated. When the ASI cross check was called, the first officer's ASI showed 88 knots and the captain's ASI 83 knots, within tolerance. The captain said, that after a scan of the engine instruments he saw an airspeed of 127 KIAS on his ASI and began takeoff rotation suspecting an erroneous indication of airspeed at the first officer's instrument. Controls felt heavy and vibrations occurred, the runway remaining ahead looked sufficient, therefore he decided to reject takeoff. No alarm or stick shaker had occurred. During roll out the captain asked what speed the first officer had on his instrument during rotation and heard 100 knots. The first officer said, he found nothing unusual until he understood rotation has begun before Vr. At that time he thought it would be dangerous to react to the actions by the captain. While taxiing back to the apron he told the captain rotation has begun at about 90 KIAS.The airplane has an autoslat feature which deploys slats close to stall speeds. During takeoff a "TAKE OFF" warning is associated with the autoslat deployment, however is inhibited as soon as the aircraft is airborne. The flight data recorder showed the "TAKE OFF" warning was issued.The airplane received minor damage: scrape marks to the belly skin of the fuselage between drain mast and APU door, the waste water drain mast was torn off, tire #2 of the left main gear was slightly damaged.The captain had 5302 hours flying experience thereof 2456 on type and 116 as commander and 226 as captain trainee. He was properly rested, his work schedule had been in line with Tunisia's regulations.The first officer had 1175 hours flying experience thereof 971 on type. He too was properly rested, his work schedule had been in line with Tunisia's regulations.The airplane logs showed no anomaly in the 7 days prior to the incident. A post incident examination of the pitot system revealed no anomaly, no leak and no malfunction.The BEA analysed that it was impossible to determine why the captain thought to have seen a speed of 127 KIAS when the airplane was in fact 40 knots below that speed. At that time about 15 seconds had elapsed during the takeoff run instead of the usual 25 seconds. Light conditions and visibility were good and it would have been easy to verify the speed from external visual clues. There was no call out by the first officer indicating V1 or rotate. The captain did not attribute the heavy controls to lack of airspeed but thought the trim setting was incorrect.The lack of experience by the commander and lack of concentration therefore appear to be the explanation for his actions.There has been no call out defined if rotation is initiated way below V1. The lack of intervention by the first officer did not permit the captain to recognize his error. At the same time, the lack of communication by the captain to initiate rotation prevented the first officer to respond indicating speed too low. After the aircraft became airborne the captain decided to reject takeoff due to the heavy control forces but again without any call out/communication.
A Delta Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-88, flight DL-1097 from Atlanta,GA to Houston Hobby,TX (USA) with 119 passengers, returned to Atlanta after the crew detected smoke in the cockpit shortly after takeoff. The airplane landed safely 11 minutes after departure, the smoke dissipated and the aircraft taxied to the apron, where passengers disembarked normally.The FAA said, the crew reported smoke in the cockpit, landed shortly after departure and taxied to the gate.Delta reported, that the aircraft landed safely 11 minutes after departure possibly because of smoke in the airplane.
A Saratov Airlines Yakovlev Yak-42, flight 6W-762 from Saratov to Moscow Domodedovo (Russia) with 84 passengers, rejected takeoff from Saratov due to an engine vibration indication. The airplane slowed safely and returned to the apron.A replacement aircraft reached Moscow with a delay of 3 hours.The airline said, it was a malfunction of the sensor.
An Air Europa Boeing 737-800, flight UX-5911 from Tenerife Sur Reina Sofia,CI to Lanzarote,CI (Spain) with about 50 passengers, rejected takeoff from Tenerife's Sur Reina Airport due to some indication from the cabin. A main gear tyre burst during slow down.The runway was closed for about 45 minutes until all debris was cleared. A number of flights suffered serious delays as result of the closed runway.The airplane had already lined up and was waiting for takeoff about 4 hours earlier but returned to the apron when the same indication came from the cabin. All passengers had disembarked, mechanics thought they fixed the issue and released the aircraft for the flight again.The flight was postponed to the following day when a replacement Boeing 737-800 registration EC-KEO reached Lanzarote with 111 passengers and a total delay of 28 hours.
An American Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-82, flight AA-806 from Phoenix,AZ to Dallas Ft. Worth,TX (USA) with 147 passengers and 5 crew, rejected takeoff from Phoenix's runway 07L following an engine failure, which distributed debris along the runway. The airplane slowed safely and returned to the apron.The runway was closed for about 90 minutes.The airline said, the engine "spat" numerous metal parts through the exhaust pipe onto the runway.
A Malev Hungarian Airlines Boeing 737-600, registration HA-LOF performing flight MA-200 from Budapest (Hungary) to Istanbul Ataturk (Turkey) with 100 passengers, rejected takeoff at high speed following a bird strike.

An Openskies Boeing 757-200, registration F-HAVI performing flight EC-1 from Paris Orly (France) to Newark,NJ (USA), rejected takeoff from Orly Airport at high speed, the airplane slowed safely and vacated the runway. Emergency services responded, six tyres deflated due to hot brakes.A replacement Boeing 757-200 registration F-HAVN reached Newark with a delay of 7:20 hours.The airline reported, the takeoff was rejected at high speed due to an inconsistency between what the crew expected and got to see on their instruments. The airplane slowed safely and vacated the runway, the aircraft received minor damage to tyres and wheels consistent with a rejected takeoff at high speed. A replacement aircraft was dispatched to Newark.Sources within the airline reported, that the takeoff was rejected because a of wrong flap setting, flaps deployed to 1 degree only with another flap setting having been planned. After the airplane had vacated the runway, air traffic control advised of smoke from the landing gear, emergency services responded and cooled the brakes, however not before six tyres had deflated.The incident airplane resumed service 2 days later.
An Aerogal Boeing 767-300, registration HC-CIJ performing flight 2K-700 from Guayaquil (Ecuador) to New York JFK,NY (USA), was concluding a VOR approach to runway 13L and was cleared to land on runway 13L. Another airliner had just been cleared for takeoff on runway 13R, when the next in queue, who had just been cleared to position and hold, radioed that there was an approach turning onto 13R. The tower instructed the Aerogal Boeing to go around because of approaching the wrong runway and instructed them to turn right onto a heading of 180 because of the takeoff on the runway. HC-CIJ landed safely on runway 13L on their second approach about 10 minutes later.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/GLG700/history/20100919/2012Z/SEGU/KJFKVOR rwy 13L/R (Graphics: FAA):

An Egypt Air Airbus A321-200, registration SU-GBU performing flight MS-703 from Cairo (Egypt) to Milan Malpensa (Italy), blew a right hand main gear tyre during takeoff from Cairo. The crew burned off fuel for about 3 hours and returned to Cairo for a safe landing.
A S7 Sibir Airlines Airbus A319-100, flight S7-168 from Omsk to Moscow Domodedovo (Russia) with 122 passengers, rejected takeoff from Omsk at high speed when the airplane accelerated through a flock of birds and both engines ingested birds. The airplane slowed safely.A replacement aircraft reached Moscow with a delay of 5 hours.Authorities reported, that an examination found feathers in the right hand engine and 8 fractured compressor blades and blood stains in the left hand engine.
The fractured RGB helical gear shaft (Photo: JTSB)The Japanese Transportation Safety Board (JTSB) released their final report in English concluding:It is highly probable that this serious incident occurred through the following series of events:While the Aircraft was climbing after takeoff, the reduction gear box (RGB) helical input gearshaft of the No. 1 engine sustained fatigue fracture and was detached from its position; the fragments of the broken shaft then flew off, damaging the engine case and breaking the blades of the high pressure turbine (HPT) and the blades and vanes of the low pressure turbine (LPT) and power turbine (PT - "downstream stage turbine from whichthe power for rotating the propeller is extracted") at the downstream stages, and this resulted in breakdown of the engine.With regard to the fatigue fracture of the RGB helical input gearshaft, it is considered probable that fatigue cracks had started from the impurity inclusion present in the metal stock of the helical gear developed in the shaft, and after undergoing repetitive application of stress, the shaft was finally fractured.The airplane had departed Tanegashima's runway 31 with the first officer being pilot flying and was climbing through 3700 feet about 6km from the airport when a loud bang was heard, the master caution light illuminated at 3800 feet followed by the oil pressure warning light for the left hand engine, the rpms of the left hand rotors dropped sharply to about 47%. 7 seconds after the bang and 3 seconds after the oil pressure warning light the engine was shut down. The crew declared emergency, continued the climb to 8000 feet (instead of 12000 feet as initially cleared) and carried on to Kagoshima, where winds came from 330 degrees at 22 knots gusting between 17 and 31 knots, volcanic smoke was observed. The crew entered a holding at Kagishima for about 10 minutes to troubleshoot, subsequently they reported that they were unable to feather the propeller. The crew managed a safe landing on Kagoshima's runway 34 approximately 52 minutes after the loud bang.Visual post flight examination found the #1 engine and the #1 feathering pump damaged.A teardown examination of the #1 engine showed, that the RGB helical input gearshaft had developed a crack, which originated at an inclusion below the surface of the shaft. The crack developed helically from the inside to the outside until overload from torsional stress led to the development of fatigue cracks and eventually failure of the gearshaft.The HPT rotor blades were damaged by impact forces and overheating.The LPT rotor blades were damaged by impact forces and overheating. All vanes were damaged by heat.All PT vanes were damaged by impact forces, the #1 stage and #2 stage blades as well as the shaft were fractured. Examination of the fracture surfaces showed tensile-stress-caused overloading.A teardown examination of the feathering pump drive motor showed that the motor was defective due to both rotor and static magnets being contaminated with iron powder dust. The static magnets were corroded and detached due to the separation of retaining adhesive. The armature had interfered with the static magnets both.Examination of other motors revealed three mose motors showed the same failure mode.

A Singapore Airlines Airbus A330-300, flight SQ-877 from Taipei (Taiwan) to Singapore (Singapore), was preparing for takeoff from Taipei's runway 05, was cleared for takeoff and commenced the takeoff roll at 14:36L (06:36Z).An Antonov AN-124 operated by an Ukrainian Airline (editorial note: the only Ukrainian Airline operating AN-124s is Antonov Design Bureau) was taxiing from the Cargo Apron in the northeast of the airport to the departure runway 05 and had been cleared by ground control to taxi along taxiway N13, which crosses runway 05 at the end of the runway, and hold short of runway 05. The aircraft however continued across the hold short line at 14:36L while the Singapore Airlines A330-300 was already in the takeoff roll.The tower controller noticing the conflict required ground control to immediately have the Antonov continue at speed in order to vacate the runway.The Singapore Airlines was about two thirds down the runway, about 1100 meters (3500 feet) from the intersection runway 05/taxiway N13, when the Antonov reached the opposite hold short line and thus vacated the runway area resolving the conflict.Taiwan's Civil Aviation Authority reported in Mandarin, that the ground controller had missed a false readback by the Antonov crew, who had understood they were "cleared to cross the runway" instead of "hold short of the runway". The ground controller was suspended, the CAA are reviewing control procedures at Taipei's Taoyuan International Airport. A NOTAM has been released on Aug 11th identifying three hot spots at the airport which require special attention by crews. A monitoring and supervising project has been introduced. Air traffic controllers on duty have been ordered by the CAA to pay close attention to readbacks and maintain focus in order to avoid a repeat of such an incident.

Group A Leading Edge Flaps (Graphics: SACAA)The South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) have released their final report concluding the probable cause of the serious incident was: Loss of a significant amount of lift on rotation during the takeoff caused by the automatic LE flap retraction logic retracting the Group A LE flaps on receipt of spurious thrust reverser unlock signals from the no. 2 and no. 3 engines. The possibility of such an occurrence had not been identified during amendment of the retraction logic.The SACAA wrote as last of their findings: "The flying crew should be commended for the professional way that they controlled the aircraft during a critical stage during takeoff and thereby ensured the safety of the 283 occupants on board the aircraft."The airplane was departing Johanneburg's runway 03L. The departure was planned at reduced takeoff power, the first officer was pilot flying. Calculated speeds were V1=150, Vr=168 and V2=176 KIAS at flaps 20. The #3 thrust reverser amber message displayed on the EICAS screen at about 125.6 knots (below V1), the #2 thrust reverser amber message at 159.9 knots (above V1, just below Vr). At this stage the leading edge Group A flaps retracted automatically according to system logic, speed was 164 KIAS. The airplane rotated at 173 KIAS and became airborne at 176 KIAS. The stick shaker immediately activatated at a radio altitude of 4 feet intermittently for 8 seconds during the next 15 seconds, significant buffeting was observed. The pilot flying, having significant experience with aircraft buffeting due to aerobatics flying, continued to fly the aircraft with the captain, remaining pilot monitoring, calling out aircraft height. The landing gear was retracted at 177 KIAS and the leading edge flaps immediately deployed again reaching their normal position at a height of 56 feet AGL, the stick shaker ceased at 186 KIAS. The leading edge flaps reached their deployed position again 23 seconds after retracting, the airplane performance returned to normal thereafter and the airplane climbed out. Whilst climbing through 7000 feet the crew declared PAN reporting problems with the #2 and #3 engine and decided to return to Johannesburg. The airplane continued to climb to FL150, dumped fuel and landed safely 92 minutes after liftoff.The leading edge Group A flaps (all leading edge flaps inboard of the outboard engines) are designed to automatically retract if the airplane is in ground mode and either reversers #1 and #4 or reversers #2 and #3 are unlocked. This design is meant to reduce wear on the flap panels, that the airflow from the thrust reversers would produce on the extended panels.The thrust reversers did not unlock and remained in their stowed position all time, however were at the rear end of their permitted travel in high power engine operation. The stow sensors for thrust reversers #1, #2 and #3 were rigged outside the requirements with the target set too far forward thus causing the unlocked indication with the thrust reverser cowls in their permitted yet rear position.The crew were and remained unaware of the Group A leading edges having retracted due to this automatic retraction only visible on a separate indication. Only the extended flap EICAS display would have provided them with the according information, however the display was not brought up. The only available indication was a color change of the flap display in the regular EICAS display which however is hardly visible.The SACAA noted in their findings: "During this time the flight deck crew had no indication or understanding of what had caused the lack in performance of the aircraft." Several safety actions are underway as result of the occurrence. Boeing plans to change the system logic withdrawing the reverser unlock signal from the autoretract logic, which would continue to function based on the reverser handles and air/ground logic. This was put into an Airworthiness Directive by the FAA.The SACAA released a number of safety recommendations concerning the man/machine interface, spurious alerts and robustness of software and hardware control logic.QAR quick access recorders graphics representation (Graphics: SACAA):
9Q-COQ on soft ground (Photo: atdb.aero)A Hewa Bora McDonnell Douglas MD-82, registration 9Q-COQ performing flight EO-601 from Kinshasa N'Djili to Lubumbashi (Democratic Republic of Congo) with 103 passengers and 7 crew, burst a tyre on takeoff from N'Djili Airport, debris damaged a hydraulic system and left hand engine. The crew decided to return to the airport, but could not lower the nose gear anymore causing the airplane to veer right off the landing runway 06 after touch down. The airplane came to a stand still on grassy ground off the runway, no injuries occured, the damage to the aircraft is unknown.The airline confirmed, that the airplane returned to Kinshasa on one engine. The deplorable state of the runway caused a tyre damage on takeoff, which damaged a hydraulic system and the left hand engine forcing the engine to be shut down, the hydraulic failure preventing part of the gear to extend resulting in a runway excursion. All passengers and crew exited the airplane uninjured.Congolese Accident Investigators confirmed on Jun 25th, that a tyre blew on the left hand main gear, the tyre debris caused damage to a hydraulic line and the subsequent hydraulic failure and was ingested into the left hand engine. After touchdown the airplane veered off the runway after about 1000 meters roll on the runway and came to a rest about 1500 meters from the runway threshold to the right of the runway.

Wood Pigeon (Photo: John Willis) A Ryanair Boeing 737-800, registration EI-DWD performing flight FR-8631 from Trapani (Italy) to Brussels Charleroi (Belgium) with 165 passengers and 6 crew, struck a flock of wood pigeons during takeoff from runway 31L and returned to Trapani for an immediate emergency landing. The airplane landed safely with both engines still operating though at higher than normal vibration levels.The Italian "Agenzia Nazionale per la Sicurezza del Volo" ANSV reported, that both engines received damage to the fan blades. The ANSV opened an investigation into the serious incident. The American NTSB reported on Jun 2nd 2010, that the aircraft with 165 passengers and 6 crew ingested birds into both engines during takeoff from runway 31L. Both engines received damage to their fan blades. Italy's ANSV is conducting the investigation.
The NTSB have issued urgent safety recommendations for the General Electric CF6-45 and CF6-50 series engines. The NTSB cited four uncontained engine failures prompting the safety recommendations:Phuket Airlines Boeing 747-300 registration HS-VAC on takeoff from Jeddah, see Incident: Phuket Airlines B743 at Jeddah on Jul 4th 2008, engine failure during takeoff.Arrow Cargo McDonnell Douglas DC-10 registration N526MD on departure from Manaus, see Accident: Arrow Cargo DC10 at Manaus on Mar 26th 2009, dropped parts of engine on houses.Jett8 Airlines Boeing 747-200 registration 9V-JEB on departure from Singapore, see Incident: Jett8 B742 at Singapore on Dec 17th 2009, uncontained engine failure.ACT Airlines Airbus A300B4 registration TC-ACE rejected takeoff from Bahrain, see Incident: ACT Airlines A30B at Bahrain on Apr 10th 2010, rejected takeoff.In all cases the low pressure turbine stage 3 rotor had separated from the engine as result of material loss on the high pressure turbine blades, that caused vibrations of the high pressure rotor.Although the series of incidents had prompted General Electrics to lower inspection intervals, the most recent ACT incident prompted the NTSB to conclude that the current measures to detect high pressure turbine blade material loss are insufficient and a boroscopic inspection of the high pressure turbine blades as well as a fluorescent penetrant inspection of the low pressure turbine stage 3 disk is necessary every 15 flight cycles until the low power turbine disk has been replaced by a new design, that can withstand the unbalanced vibration forces from the high pressure turbine rotor.The NTSB also recommends that General Electric should be required to redesign the low pressure turbine stage 3 disk to be able to withstand the vibration forces created by an unbalanced high pressure turbine rotor.
A Tulpar Avia Yakovlev Yak-42 on behalf of Sky Express, flight XW-251 from Moscow Vnukovo to Krasnodar (Russia) with 97 passengers, rejected takeoff from Moscow's Vnukovo Airport close to decision speed when an engine surged. The airplane overran the end of the runway by about 40 meters before coming to a stop. No injuries and no damage occured.The flight was cancelled, the passengers were rebooked onto the next flight about 3.5 hours later.Sky Express confirmed an engine surge but did not confirm initial reports that the engine may have surged due to a bird strike. 
Japanese Gray Heron (Photo: Bernard Gagnon)The Japanese Transportation Safety Board (JTSB) released their final report in Japanese concluding the probable cause of the accident was:a collision with a bird shortly after takeoff from Izumo causing substantial damage to the aircraft.The airplane collided with a bird at about 300 feet AGL shortly after takeoff from Izumo's runway 07, impact point was the left hand side of the nose cone. The first officer thought the bang produced by the impact was related to an engine while the captain thought he had seen a bird hit the aircraft. When they did not receive any abnormal indication nor noticed any abnormal handling, they decided to continue their flight to Osaka's Itami Airport, where the airplane landed safely 41 minutes later. A post flight inspection revealed two large dent (one 19.6 cm in diameter and 16mm deep, the other 14-15 cm in length) at the left hand side of the nose cone covered with blood and one white feather, underneath the dented skin a longeron was found bent, which required major repair work.The Board did not identify the species of the bird, no bird remains were found on the ground following the bird strike. The white feather found on the aircraft led the board to believe however, that the airplane collided with a heron.Usual birds around the airport are ducks, eagles, crows and herons.Impact marks (Photo: JTSB):

Backview of RA-47360 (Photo: MAK) The Russian Interstate Aviation Committee (MAK) released their final report in Russian concluding that the probable cause of the accident wasearly retraction of the landing gear by the mechanics while still on the ground during the takeoff roll and without command by the pilot flying due to spatial disorientation and perceiption of flight. The subsequent action to return the landing gear lever to the down position did not prevent the developing unique scenario anymore.Contributing was the lack of procedures of transferring control to the first officer during the takeoff phase, the definition of responsibilities of the flight mechanics to bring the airplane into airborne configuration and deficiencies of communication between crew members due to the intercom being turned off.The MAK said, that while the airplane was into the takeoff roll still on the ground, the flight crew called out "takeoff continue" accelerating through decision speed, the mechanics released the throttle levers and placed his hand onto the gear lever. The captain advised the first officer to "lift the nose" early and about 30 knots below the Vr of 124 KIAS in order to reduce vibrations into the landing roll, the first officer lifted the nose off the ground. The mechanics mistook the phrase as command to retract the gear, saw the nose gear was off the ground and had the impression of being in flight, therefore retracted the gear. The airplane began to immediately sink onto its belly until the left hand propeller struck the runway surface. The captain decided to reject the takeoff, the propellers were feathered. The airplane skidded on its belly to a stop with sparks emanating due to the friction with the runway, the sparks also entering the cabin of the aircraft. After the airplane came to a stop, the captain initiated an evacuation.The airplane received substantial including structural damage to the fuselage, the left propeller, both wing root support structures, wheels and tyres and flaps.The flight mechanics (47) accumulated 9500 hours of flying time, thereof 5320 hours on the Antonov 24.The MAK analysed, that the landing gear lock preventing the airplane from retracting the gear while on the ground was disabled with thrust levers being pushed 25+4 degrees forward, the right hand aborber strut of the gear being decompressed or an additional guarded switch to unlock the gear. The guarded switch was found untouched. The MAK analysed further, that on uneven runway surfaces it is possible the right hand shock absorber gets uncompressed at speeds well below airborne speeds.The right hand main gear (Photo: MAK):
A LIAT de Havilland Dash 8-300, flight LI-506 from Antigua (Antigua) to Saint Kitts (St. Kitts and Nevis) with 35 passengers and 3 crew, returned to Antigua when an engine malfunctioned shortly after takeoff.

A Westjet Boeing 737-800, registration C-FWSE performing flight WS-1852 from Vancouver,BC (Canada) to Kahului,HI (USA) with 136 people on board, rejected takeoff from Vancouver's runway 26L at about 80 knots when the crew noticed the autothrottle had disengaged. The airplane slowed safely and returned to the gate.The same airplane departed again after maintenance and reached Kahului with a delay of one hour.The Canadian TSB reported on May 4th, that the crew noticed thrust lever 1 (left hand) was moving more than lever 2 (right). When the airplane accelerated through about 70 knots the crew heard a click sound and saw the autothrottle system had disengaged. The captain rejected takeoff at about 80 knots. After the airplane returned to the gate maintenance determined that the autothrottle system was unserviceable and released the airplane under Minimum Equipment List requirements.
Attention at left hand main gear (Photo: JS) A Lufthansa Cityline Canadair CRJ-900, registration D-ACKF performing flight LH-3084 from Munich (Germany) to Copenhagen (Denmark), rejected takeoff from Munich's runway 26R at high speed due an abnormal indication. The airplane slowed safely and returned to the apron.Following repairs concentrating on the left hand main gear the airplane departed again and reached Copenhagen with a delay of 55 minutes.Passenger J.S. said, the crew explained they had an indication of a brakes problem which most likely occured due to a failed sensor.
The crew of a Skywest Canadair CRJ-200 on behalf of United Airlines, registration N975SW performing flight OO-6470/UA-6470 from Los Angeles,CA to Salt Lake City,UT (USA), reported after takeoff, that they had a landing gear problem with all three indications remaining green requiring them to return to Los Angeles.

The crew of a Europe Airpost Boeing 737-300, registration F-GIXS performing freight flight 5O-3502 from Funchal to Lisbon (Portugal), reported flaps problems shortly after takeoff from Funchal and decided to divert to Porto Santo also on the Madeira Islands for a safe landing.
A Kenya Airways Boeing 737-700, registration 5Y-KYA performing flight KQ-507 (dep May 4th) from Douala (Cameroon) to Nairobi (Kenya) with 108 passengers and 6 crew, took off Douala's runway 12 6 minutes past midnight local time (23:06Z May 4th), but lost height after takeoff in bad weather and impacted a swamp 2 minutes after takeoff. All occupants perished in the crash, the airplane was completely destroyed.Cameroon's Civil Aviation Authority (CCAA) have released their final report (40MB, entirely in graphics) concluding the probable causes were:The airplane crashed after loss of control by the crew as a result of spatial disorientation (non recognized or subtle type transitioning to recognized spatial disorientation), after a long slow roll, during which no instrument scanning was done, and in the absence of external visual references in a dark night.Inadequate operational control, lack of crew coordination, coupled with the non-adherence to procedures of flight monitoring, confusion in the utlization of the AP (Editorial note: autopilot), have also contributed to this situation.The CCAA reported, that the previous sector of flight KQ-507 from Abidjan (Cote d'Ivoire) to Douala had been uneventful, preparations for the flight to Nairobi commenced normally. After some delay to wait for a pause in heavy rainfall the crew taxied the airplane to runway 12 performing normal checks of flight controls, deploying flaps to 5 degrees and completing the before taxi and before takeoff checklists. The airplane received a departure cleared to climb to FL370, EDEBA 1E departure.The captain requests the departure clearance to be slightly modified saying, they wanted to maintain slightly left of the runway centerline due to weather. The first officer corrects "right", the captain says "sorry, slightly right". Tower approves.The captain was pilot flying, he selected a heading of 118 degrees and a speed of 150 KIAS into the airplane's master control panel. The autothrust is engaged, engines spool up for takeoff at 99% N1, on the first officer's call rotate the captain rotates the aircraft, 9 seconds later the gear gets retracted. Immediately after becoming airborne the airplane exhibits a tendency to roll right, the captain corrects by a left aileron input (30 degrees left) and returns the control wheel to neutral. The captain continues to provide several left control wheel inputs while the airplane climbs up to 1000 feet AGL, the bank angle remains within neutral and 3 degrees to the right. After the airplane climbed through 1000 feet AGL, all control inputs ceased for 55 seconds. The captain called for HDG SEL (heading select, autopilot mode), the first officer confirms heading selected. The heading selector is moved from 118 to 132 degrees and further to 139 degrees, the airplane rolls from less than 1 degree right bank to 6 degrees right during the next 6 seconds.Engine power is reduced to climb power at 1600 feet MSL, the bank angle has increased to 11 degrees right, the flight director beginning to indicate left.The captain calls "OK Command" without a response from the first officer. The autopilot is still not engaged.The first officer asks "I remain on legs" (editorial note: the waypoint page on the flight management system's display unit), the captain confirms "yes". The heading goes through 139 degrees, bank angle has increased to 15 degrees right.The heading selector is turned left to 120 degrees, the right roll continues and reaches 20 degrees bank angle.69 seconds after liftoff a heading of 165 degrees is selected, the airplane climbs through 2600 feet at a heading of 190 degrees and speed of 190 KIAS and a right bank angle of 24 degrees.79 seconds after takeoff and 55 seconds after control inputs ceased the aural alert "Bank Angle" sounded. The control wheel is immediately turned 22 degrees to the right, then 20 degrees to the left and again 45 degrees to the right before the wheel is turned 11 degrees to the left. The right bank angle increases.83 seconds after takeoff, without any call, the autopilot A is engaged in "CMD A" mode, and action on the yoke ceases, some action on the rudder continues. The bank angle of 50 degrees at that point tends to stabilize.5 seconds later intense control wheel inputs to the right, then left and right again continue, several bursts of rudder inputs are made to the right. The captain announces "we are crashing." The airplane had reached 2800 feet at 220 KIAS and a right bank angle of 55 degrees, which was now increasing rapidly.1 second later the right bank angle has increased to 70 degrees with right rudder bursts still continuing.91 seconds after takeoff right rudder input still continues while the control wheel is moved fully to the left. The airplane reached its maximum altitude of 2900 feet, the altitude is now rapidly decreasing. Heading is 290 degrees, bank angle 80 degrees and rapidly increasing, speed 220 KIAS.93 seconds after takeoff the first officer calls "RIGHT, Captain, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, Correction LEFT". Bank angle is 90 degrees, the airplane diving through 2700 feet, heading 330 degrees.95 seconds after takeoff the bank angle peaked at 115 degrees then reduced to 70 degrees following full left hand control wheel input. Full left aileron, but still right hand rudder input continues.102 seconds after liftoff the airplane impacts with a speed of 287 KIAS, a pitch angle of 48 degrees nose down, heading 90 degrees and a right bank angle of 60 degrees. The airplane is completely destroyed, all occupants perish. The emergency locator transmitter (ELT) is destroyed as well and does not transmit any signal.The captain was 52 years of age and had a total of 8682 flying hours and 3464 as captain. Thereof he had captained a Boeing 737-700 for 665 hours and a Boeing 737-800 for 158 hours. He had exhibited recurrent performance deficits in crew resource management, adherence to standard operating procedures, cockpit scan and situation awareness. During training for captaincy a progress report described the captain showing a satisfactory performance in aircraft handling, over-bearing tendency towards collegues, touch of arrogance and insufficient flight discipline notably cockpit scan and situation awareness. The report recommended continous monitoring of these character traits.The first officer was 23 years of age and had 831 flying hours, 113 thereof on Boeing 737-700 and 57 hours on Boeing 737-800. During his training reports mentioned the need to improve in situation awareness, radio handling, monitoring and calling out deviations of pilot flying, monitor autopilot when engaged and cockpit preparation. The overall performance was rated satisfactory however. During his proficiency check in early 2007 the examiner recommended the first officer shoud monitor the deviations by pilot flying and call them out and monitor the performance of the autopilot when the autopilot is engaged. There is no evidence, that the first officer went through a crew resource management training, though he was scheduled for the training in September 2006.The airplane had been manufactured in 2006 and had accumulated 2100 flying hours in 734 cycles.The weather at Douala had been dominated by a massive cloud cluster embedding thunderstorms. At the time of planned departure thunderstorms with moderate rain and reduced visibility were observed at the aerodrome, visibility was 2500 meters with a low ceiling at 300 feet. The visibility deteriorated further to about 800 meters approximately 15 minutes before actual takeoff, 6 minutes prior to the takeoff the weather begins to markedly improve.At the time of the accident the thunderstorms had moved to the southsoutheast of the aerodrome, the weather at the airport started to improve. After the accident weather improvement continued, visibility reached 4000 meters 20 minutes after impact, the thunderstorms dissipate.Data recorded by the flight data and cockpit voice recorders suggest, that all aircraft systems were working normally until impact.The CCAA analysed, that the airplane entered a spiral dive as result of an uncommanded right roll that was not checked by the crew. After the right roll was detected, the pilot inputs were erratic leading to excessive bank angles and a rapid loss of height.When the captain called "OK, Command", he meant the first officer should engage the autopilot. The first officer however did not respond, either because he did not hear the command, heard the command but did not cross check the flight mode announciators (editorial note: showing whether the autopilot was engaged nor not), heard the callout without seeing any changes in the flight mode announciators and therefore did not call out, or he did not respond because standard operating procedures by Kenya Airways (in deviation from Boeing's manual) did not require him to make a verbal confirmation.Following the "OK Command" call the captain performs consistently with the autopilot being engaged, although the autopilot engagement has not been confirmed by a call out of the first officer nor by the flight mode announciators.The flight data recorder recorded a slight pressure on the control column at the time of the "OK Command" call making it possible, that the autopilot was selected engaged, but did not engage due to the interference by the control column.The CCAA also analysed, that the "CMD A" mode of the autopilot had suffered recurrent breakdowns in the three months prior to the crash.The first officer makes several changes to the heading selector without any effect on the aircraft behaviour. The first officer however made no callout, he also made no callout when the flight director roll bars deviated.The CCAA says: "The behaviour of the flight crew during those 55 seconds demonstrates a lack of rigor in piloting, non-respect of the repartition of tasks on board, confusion in the use of the auto flight director system and poor situation awareness."After the autopilot was finally engaged in CMD mode, the captain does not apprehend the rate of correction the autopilot applies and resumes his confused and erratic control inputs forcing the autopilot to fall back into command wheel steering pitch mode. The captain thinks he has lost control of the airplane and cries out they were crashing, then aggravates the situation further by prolonged right rudder input.The CCAA continued their analysis saying, that the reaction of the captain is consistent with spatial disorientation.Aerial view of the crash site (Photo: CCAA):Graphics representation of flight data recorder (Graphics: CCAA):Map (Courtesy Google Earth):
A Vueling Airbus A320-200, registration EC-HQL performing flight VY-2267 from Seville,SP to Barcelona,SP (Spain), ingested a bird into its right hand engine (CFM56) shortly after takeoff from Seville prompting the crew to shut the engine down and return to Seville for a safe landing.A replacement aircraft is estimated to reach Barcelona with a delay of 5 hours.

The Japanese TSB have released their final report into the serious incident concluding, that during the takeoff run the drum holding the blades of the first stage of low pressure turbine of the left hand engine (PW150A) failed causing damage to four blades, the fragments of which in turn seriously damaged the blades in the second stage of the low pressure turbine.The airplane was preparing for departure, when the crew noticed during engine start, that the InterTurbine Temperature (ITT) for the left hand engine showed about 50 degrees C higher than for the right hand engine. The engine continued to show 50 degrees higher throughout taxi and initial takeoff run on Osaka Itami's runway 32R. Just after the 80 knots call the ITT of the left hand engine's ITT rose above limits, its torque fell to zero, the crew heard a crunchy sound, felt a yaw to the left and rejected takeoff at high speed. During slow down the crew received an indication, that the left hand FADEC had failed. The airplane came to a safe standstill.The JTSB reported, that the takeoff was actually rejected at 90 KIAS. There were no injuries, the airplane received damage only to its left hand engine.The engine showed damage to its low pressure turbine with smut adhesions seen at the back of the high pressure turbine.The JTSB said, that the high pressure turbine showed indications of oxidation sending materials down the stream into the low pressure turbine. The materials such swept into the low pressure turbine accumulated at the first stage of the low pressure turbine thus disabling the cooling of the blades and drum causing heat damage to the blades and drum, until a segment of the drum holding 4 blades gave way. Those 4 blades fractured causing damage to other blades of the first stage and basically destroying all blades of the second stage.The engine casing was not breached.A look onto the damaged low pressure turbine (Photo: JTSB):
A Southwest Airlines Boeing 737-300, flight WN-1644 from Los Angeles,CA to San Jose,CA (USA), suffered a compressor stall of the left hand engine while on initial climb out of Los Angeles. The crew returned to Los Angeles for a safe landing about 10 minutes after takeoff.
An Eastern Airways Saab 2000, registration G-CERZ performing positioning flight EZE-803P from Bern (Switzerland) to Birmingham,EN (UK) with just crew on board, was backtracking runway 14 for departure, when during the 180 degrees turn to line up for takeoff one of the main wheels departed the paved surface at approximately 18:40L (17:40Z) and got stuck on soft ground. The airplane needed to be towed back onto paved surface and to the apron for an examination. The airport was closed for about one hour as a result.The Airport reported, that the airplane was turning around to line up runway 14 for departure, when a main wheel left the runway.Eastern Airways reported, that the airplane was turning from the taxiway onto the runway, when the main wheel went off paved surface. Following checks the airplane departed to Birmingham at 21:30L (20:30Z). The airline conducts an investigation as to why the wheel departed the paved surface.
A Federal Express Boeing 727-200, freight flight FX-1374 from Huntington,WV to Memphis,TN (USA), rejected takeoff due to a deer on the runway.

A Qantas Airbus A330-200, registration VH-EBG performing flight QF-129 from Sydney,NS (Australia) to Shanghai (China) with 197 passengers, could not fully retract the landing gear after takeoff, entered a holding to burn off fuel and returned to Sydney for a safe landing about 3.5 hours after departure.A replacement Airbus A330-300 registration VH-QPC is estimated to reach Shanghai with a delay of 5.5 hours.
A Delta Airlines Boeing 757-200, flight DL-2066 from Tampa,FL to Atlanta,GA (USA), was advised of a flock of birds at the departure end of the runway and cleared for takeoff from runway 18R. When the aircraft climbed through 600 feet, the crew advised they had been hit on the fuselage by a buzzard. The crew continued for a safe landing in Atlanta.The immediately preceding departing traffic, a US Airways Airbus A321 performing flight US-1884 to Philadelphia,PA (USA), had already reported they needed to maneouver around a large flock of buzzards right overhead the departure end of the runway seconds before the Delta Airlines Boeing was cleared for takeoff.The FAA reported, that the Delta Airlines Boeing received minor damage to the landing gear taxi light.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/DAL2066/history/20100215/1741Z/KTPA/KATL
A Westjet Boeing 737-700, registration C-GWSE performing flight WS-1478 from Calgary,AB (Canada) to Las Vegas,NV (USA) with 141 people on board, initiated takeoff with autothrust being engaged and thrust setting 86.4% N1. When the left hand engine (CFM56) stopped accelerating at 81% with the right hand engine continuing to 86.4%, the crew manually advanced the left hand thrust lever, the engine however did not only not accelerate, but slowed. Therefore the crew rejected takeoff just as the speed had reached 85 KIAS. While slowing through 70 KIAS the left hand engine failed. The airplane slowed safely and returned to the gate.The Canadian TSB reported, that maintenance personnel observed fuel leaking from the hydromechanical unit of the engine. The operator will keep the TSB advised of further findings.A replacement Boeing 737-700 reached Las Vegas with a delay of 3 hours.

A Qantas Boeing 767-300, registration VH-ZXA performing flight QF-453 from Sydney,NS to Melbourne,VI (Australia) with 120 passengers, was rotating for takeoff from runway 16R at 17:08L (06:08Z), when the crew of another aircraft saw the tail of the Boeing 767 contact the ground and radioed the Qantas crew. The Qantas crew levelled off at 5000 feet and decided to return to Sydney's runway 16R for a safe landing about 15 minutes after departure.The flight was cancelled, the passengers were rebooked onto other flights.A runway inspection showed a scrape mark just south of the crossing runway.Qantas said, that during rotation the airplane encountered a gust lifting the nose more sharply than usual, so that the tail skid contacted the runway surface, the tail strike indication in the cockpit activated. There was no damage to the aircraft though some paint was scratched off the tail skid assembly. The airplane was already cleared to fly again. The ATSB and Australia's Civil Aviation Authority have been notified of the occurrence.The ATSB confirmed being notified about the occurrence, the ATSB will not investigate the occurrence.Metars:YSSY 010830Z 10013KT 9999 SCT024 BKN300 25/18 Q1016 NOSIG YSSY 010800Z 08013KT 9999 SCT025 BKN300 25/18 Q1016 NOSIG YSSY 010730Z 09015KT 9999 SCT025 BKN300 26/19 Q1016 NOSIG YSSY 010700Z 09014KT 9999 SCT025 BKN300 26/18 Q1015 NOSIG YSSY 010630Z 08013KT 9999 SCT025 SCT300 26/19 Q1015 NOSIGYSSY 010600Z 08015KT 9999 SCT025 SCT300 27/19 Q1015 NOSIGYSSY 010530Z 08017KT 9999 BKN025 BKN300 27/19 Q1015 NOSIG YSSY 010500Z 09016KT 9999 SCT025 BKN300 27/18 Q1015 NOSIG YSSY 010430Z 07016KT 9999 SCT024 BKN300 28/19 Q1015 NOSIG YSSY 010400Z 08017KT 9999 SCT024 BKN300 28/19 Q1016 NOSIG Map (Courtesy Google Earth):
An Emirates Airlines Boeing 777-300, registration A6-EBM performing flight EK-48 from Frankfurt/Main (Germany) to Dubai (United Arab Emirates), rejected takeoff from runway 18 at low speed after the right hand engine (GE90) emitted a loud bang and intermittent flames were seen from the engine. The airplane stopped on the runway, the flames from the engine ceased, emergency services responded. About 20 minutes later the airplane taxied clear of the runway and was subsequently towed to the apron.The flight was cancelled, the passengers were taken to local hotels and rebooked onto the next day's flights.A passenger reported, that the engine sounded rough during engine acceleration and caused strong vibrations of the airframe. About 7-8 seconds later the bang occured and the engine began to emit pulsating fire for a few seconds.The aircraft was able to depart Frankfurt two days later.

An Easyjet Airbus A319-100, registration G-EZDM performing flight U2-604 from Belfast Aldergrove,NI to Liverpool,EN (UK), rejected takeoff from Aldergrove's runway 07 when the crew saw a flock of sea gulls in the departure path. The airplane returned to the apron for a check.The airplane departed again and reached Liverpool with a delay of 70 minutes.A passenger reported, that the airplane was well into acceleration when the crew rejected takeoff. Later the captain announced, that he thought a sea gull was going to hit the engine and therefore rejected takeoff.Easyjet said, that a flock of birds came into the departure path of the aircraft, so that the crew decided to reject takeoff as a precaution.
A UPS Boeing 757-200, freight flight 5X-6491 from Calgary,AB (Canada) to Louisville,KY (USA), rejected takeoff from Calgary's runway 34 after the crew suspected a compressor stall of the left hand engine. The airplane slowed safely, ATC ordered another flight on final approach to go around.
An Air France Boeing 747-400 freighter, registration F-GIUA performing freight flight AF-6419 from Guadalajara (Mexico) to Paris Charles de Gaulle (France), rejected takeoff at high speed from Guadalajara's runway 28 at 06:35L (12:35Z) due to a cockpit indication. The airplane slowed safely, a number of tyres deflated however due to brakes overheating.The runway was closed for about 30 minutes until the airplane could be moved off the runway.The flight was subsequently cancelled due to technical problems.
A Mexicana Airbus A318-100, registration XA-UBQ performing flight MX-368 from Cancun to Mexico City (Mexico) with 45 passengers, was during its takeoff run above V1, when both outboard and inboard core cowling of the left hand engine separated. The crew continued the takeoff and returned to the airport a few minutes later for a safe landing.A post flight inspection revealed, that the cowling had impacted the engine pylon, the wing and the rear fuselage and thus produced substantial damage to the airframe.Mexico's Directorate General of Civil Aviation DGCA reported, the airplane had already reached Vr and had begun rotation, when the engine cowling separated. No injuries occured, there was no damage to the airport's infrastructure.
A COPA Airlines Boeing 737-800, registration HP-1526CMP performing flight CM-453 from Buenos Aires Ezeiza (Argentina) to Panama City (Panama), was cleared to takeoff from Ezeiza's runway 35 at 03:25L (06:25Z) and was past V1, when the crew noticed another airplane standing at the departure end of the runway. The COPA crew steered to the runway edge continuing takeoff, pulled the aircraft up early and managed to climb well clear of the other aircraft. The COPA crew continued to Panama City for a safe landing.A LAN Argentina Airbus A320-200 had been cleared to perform engine tests on runway 17, runway length 3105 meters (10200 feet).Argentina's Administration Nacional de Aviacion Civil (ANAC) confirmed the incident stating, that COPA Airlines filed an according complaint saying the maneouver could have resulted in a tragedy. ANAC have opened an investigation.
Gear strut on the disused runway portion A Compagnie Africaine Aviation Boeing 727-200, registration 9Q-CAA performing a freight flight from Kinshasa to Kananga (Democratic Republic of Congo, RDC), suffered a hydraulics problem shortly after takeoff at approx 06:30L (05:30Z) prompting the crew to return to Kinshasa's Ndjili Airport. After touch down on Ndjili's runway 06 in heavy rain with water standing on the runway the airplane veered left off the runway and came to a stop with all gear collapsed and turned around by about 135 degrees at 08:00L (07:00Z). No injuries occured, the airplane received substantial damage.RDC's Directorate General of Civil Aviation reported on Jan 6th, that the hydraulics leak with the hydraulics quantity rapidly approaching zero affected the brakes, so that the captain (68) got concerned about the ability to stop the airplane in Kananga and therefore decided to return to the longer runway at Ndjili. After touch down, the airplane could not be slowed due to a brakes failure. The left hand main gear separated having the airplane veer left off the runway, the right hand main gear collapsed throwing the airplane into a "pirouette" separating the nose gear.A source within the airline reported on Jan 21st, that the airplane had suffered a tailskid strike on Dec 31st 2009 during takeoff from Goma (RDC) for Kinshasa, when a combination of tailwind and overload forced the crew to rotate at V1 and below Vr because of reaching the runway end. After arrival in Kinshasa the tailskid was checked, but was not replaced.The crew performing the flight from Kinshasa to Kananga on Jan 2nd was surprised to find the tailskid had been removed. The night had been stormy, there were remnants of the storm over the airfield producing light rain and intermittent showers.After departure, when the landing gear was selected up, the A hydraulics system "FLT CONT" illuminated, but extinguished once the gear was up and doors closed, gear indicated safe, but now the B hydraulics system "FLT CONT" light illuminated. The flight engineer called "losing hydraulics" when the B hydraulics quantity decreased and fell to zero. System A still had full pressure though quantity indication had dropped, flaps were retracted and the crew requested to level off at FL100 and enter a holding to analyse the problem.Discussing the problem at hand the crew concluded, that the A FLT CONT was caused by too much demand vs system pressure capability while retracting the gear. The according hydraulics valve operates both gear and tailskid leading the crew to suspect, that the tailskid hydraulics lines were either badly locked or no plugs installed at all after the removal. The crew therefore realised, they were going to lose A hydraulics, too, and deactivated the hydraulics pumps to preserve whatever was left for the gear extension.The crew decided to hold for two hours (90 minutes in manual reversion) hoping for a break in rain, but the drizzle kept going. With just one hour of fuel left the crew decided to perform the landing, activated the hydraulics pumps and lowered the gear received three greens with all reds extinguished, the A hydraulics quantity dropped to zero, pressure dropped to zero.The landing was done at a gross weight of 165000 lbs and a Vref of 165 KIAS for flaps at 15 degrees. The airplane touched down on the centerline about 600 feet into the runway right in the touch down zone. The crew manually (instinctively) extended spoilers and selected reverse thrust. All reverser lights came up, but there was no braking. Crew applied full reverse thrust at an EPR of 2.20, brakes on accumulators however did not develop any braking action. The crew selected air brakes to full, but no reaction. The airplane passed the tower about 2300 meters down the runway at about 100 KIAS.The threshold of runway 24 had been displaced and the now unused area of the former runway is being broken up and removed, leaving concrete piles on that section. The crew therefore tried to steer the airplane to the left hand edge around the works, but the left hand main gear went off the edge. There was an erosion at the left hand edge about 40cms deep causing the left main gear to drop below the concrete and the gear snapped off. The airplane skidded for about 300 meters on the right main gear, nose gear and left wing doing a 90 degrees pirouette in the process, at which point the right hand main gear snapped off and the aircraft now "ploughed" backwards, the nose gear digging a hole of 1 meters deep and 4 meters long. The right hand main gear ended up besides the left wing. The engines were shut down using fire handles.All main gear tyres were unscathed although full brakes had been used.The sheet metal to cover the hole left after the tailskid removal was missing as well. It is unclear, who removed the sheet. A check of the hydraulics lines - with the aim to confirm, whether the tailskid hydraulics plug had been installed - had been ordered, however without independent observer, it appears however that this check did not happen (or the assembly has been tampered with after the accident).Metars:FZAA 020900Z 27008KT 6000 -TSRA SCT016 FEW028CB OVC100 24/21 Q1014 SECT CB W BECMG NSWFZAA 020800Z 09008KT 4500 -TSRA FEW016 FEW028CB OVC100 22/22 Q1015 SECT CB W NOSIG FZAA 020700Z 09004KT 3000 -TSRA FEW016 FEW026CB OVC100 22/21 Q1015 SECT CB NW-WBECMG 6000FZAA 020600Z 27008KT 2500 TSRA SCT014 SCT028CB OVC100 22/22 Q1014 BECMG 1000 FZAA 020400Z 00000KT 9999 TS FEW012 SCT028CB BKN100 23/22 Q1012 SECT CB E BECMGTSRA 50009Q-CAA in the mud, damaged wing, broken fuselage:9Q-CAA in the mud, "paint job" in progress:9Q-CAA in the mud:Nose of 9Q-CAA:View northwards down disused portion of runway:Fuselage and wing damage:Wing damage:Detail Map (Courtesy Google Earth):Map (Courtesy Google Earth):

An Alitalia Boeing 767-300, registration EI-CRM performing flight AZ-60M from New York JFK,NY (USA) to Rome Fiumicino (Italy) with 180 people on board, was taking off runway 22R, when the tower controller asked another crew having lined up for takeoff, whether they did see anything abnormal with the departure of the Alitalia. The crew and the tower controller agreed, the Alitalia Boeing might have touched the runway with its tail skid, the tower controller radioed the crew before handing them off to departure. The crew requested to maintain 5000 feet to perform some checks and reported about 5 minutes ready to continue the flight and climb. The crew climbed to 11000 feet, but now requested to return to the airfield dumping fuel first and climbed to 12000 feet for the fuel dump. The crew did not declare emergency and did not request assistance, however requested one of the runways 31 for landing due to being at maximum landing weight and performed a safe landing on runway 31L 100 minutes after departure.The aircraft was able to depart again after two hours on the ground and reached Rome with a delay of 3.5 hours.The FAA reported unknown damage to the aircraft.

A First Air Boeing 767-200, registration C-GKLY performing freight flight 7F-5270 from Ottawa,ON to Iqaluit,NU (Canada) with 4 crew, took off a contaminated runway at increased flap setting about 100,000 lbs below maximum takeoff weight resulting in an initial climb rate of about 5000 feet per minute. The airplane had been cleared to 5000 feet prompting the autopilot to engage the altitude capture mode while the airplane climbed through 2500 feet. Unknown to the pilot the speed protection is lost during altitude capture. When the autopilot held a 4000 feet per minute climb, the airspeed dropped to 104 KIAS with a computed stall speed of 102 KIAS at 1G and a computed stick shaker activation speed at 1G of 112 KIAS, the stick shaker however did not activate, although the airplane had already pitched up to 29 degrees nose up. The crew regained control of the aircraft and continued to destination for a safe landing.The Canadian TSB reported, that the airline downloaded the data of the flight data recorder for analysis. A stick shaker test was performed, the system was found working to satisfaction. The airline concludes, that the airplane may have been at less than 1G thus reducing the actual stall speed. The operator is going to improve the safety management system to prevent a repeat of the occurrence.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/FAB5270/history/20091212/1310Z/CYOW/CYFB
A Dniproavia Embraer ERJ-145, flight Z6-397 from Simferopol to Kiev (Ukraine), rejected takeoff from Simferopol when the crew suspected a bird had been ingested into one of the engines.

The crew of a British Airways Boeing 767-300, registration G-BNWV performing flight BA-102 from Calgary,AB (Canada) to London Heathrow,EN (UK), called Mayday while taking off from Calgary's runway 34 and rejected takeoff. The airplane slowed safely, the crew subsequently cancelled the emergency and taxied back to the gate.The airplane was later able to depart again and reached London with a delay of 4.5 hours.NAV Canada reported, that the reason for the rejected takeoff is unknown.The Canadian TSB reported on Dec 16th, that the crew became aware of another aircraft on a 8nm final while lining up for departure. Surface winds were gusting up to 50 knots, the visibility was very poor due to falling snow. When full takeoff power was reached and the airplane was accelerating through 50 KIAS, the left hand engine's (RB211) amber thrust reverser light illuminated. The takeoff was rejected and the crew called "Mayday, Mayday, Mayday". Upon selecting forward idle thrust the amber reverse light extinguished. The Mayday was swiftly downgraded, after all according QRH actions were taken the aircraft taxied clear of the runway. Maintenance determined a fault with a proximity sensor control module, which produced the erroneous reverser caution.A British Airways Boeing 747-400 had experienced thrust reverser indications during takeoff in Johannesburg earlier this year, see Incident: British Airways B744 at Johannesburg on May 11th 2009, two thrust reversers indicated open, leading edge flaps retracted.Metars:CYYC 050600Z 36020G29KT 1/2SM SN BLSN VV005 M06/M07 A3003 RMK SN8 RVR RWY 34 6000FT//S01/ SLP229CYYC 050530Z 36026G36KT 3/8SM SN BLSN VV006 M06/ RMK SN8 RVR RWY 34 5000 FTCYYC 050500Z 35033G40KT 1/8SM SN +BLSN VV003 M06/M08 A2999 RMK SN8 RVR RWY 34 1600FT//S03/ SLP206 CYYC 050450Z 36029KT 3/8SM SN BLSN VV003 M05/ RMK SN8CYYC 050400Z CCA 34025G31KT 5/8SM -SN BLSN BKN006 OVC017 M05/M07 A2995 RESN RMK SC5SC3 RVR RWY 34 6000FT SLP196 CYYC 050300Z 34025G32KT 1/2SM SN BLSN BKN004 OVC015 M05/M06 A2993 RMK SC5SC3 RVR RWY 34 3500FT SLP188 CYYC 050221Z CCA 34026G35KT 1/2SM SN BLSN BKN004 OVC013 M05/ RMK SC5SC3 RVR RWY2600FTCYYC 050200Z 34032G37KT 1/2SM SN BLSN BKN007 OVC016 M05/M07 A2989 RMK SC5SC3 RVR RWY 34 3500 + 28 3000 FT /S02/ SLP171 CYYC 050100Z 34026G32KT 1/2SM SN BLSN BKN007 OVC018 M05/M07 A2987 RMK SC6SC2 RVR RWY 34 3000 + 28 4500 FT SLP165CYYC 050036Z 34029G34KT 1/4SM SN +BLSN BKN006 OVC018 M05/ RMK SC6SC2 RVR RWY 342600 + 28 1600 FT

N787BA on takeoff from Everett (Photo: AP/Ted S. Warren) The Boeing 787 Dreamliner has safely landed after completing its successful maiden flight.The first Boeing 787 registration N787BA equipped with Rolls Royce Trent 1000 engines departed Paine Field at Everett,WA (USA) at 10am local time (18:00Z), completed a test program and returned to Boeing Field at Seattle for a safe landing 3 hours later.Boeing says, that with 840 orders already placed for the new 787 the aircraft model has already become their most successful airplane. The 787 was the first brandnew design in 14 years. The airplane's structure is mainly designed of composite materials making the airplane lighter and reducing fuel consumption. The airplane has been designed take up to 290 passengers over a distance of 8500nm (15750km) at Mach 0.85 with a fuel consumption of about 20% less than today's widebodies.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/BOE1/history/20091215/1810Z/KPAE/KBFI
An Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 767-300, flight ET-800 from Nairobi (Kenya) to Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), rejected takeoff from Nairobi's runway 06 at low speed due to a technical problem. The airplane returned to the gate, where the passengers disembarked.The flight was subsequently announced cancelled, but 4 hours later the airplane was declared repaired, passengers re-embarked and reached Addis Ababa with a delay of about 4 hours.A passenger with aviation background reported, that the airplane rejected takeoff at an estimated 60-80 knots. The crew subsequently announced, the airplane had experienced technical trouble. Ground staff explained, that the flight had been cancelled, the passengers however remained in the waiting lounge. After about 4 hours, without visible works on the aircraft, ground staff announced the airplane had been repaired and was ready for boarding. The flight subsequently departed for a safe flight to Addis Ababa. Gossip amongst passengers suggested, that the airplane may have experienced a hydraulics problem without corroborating evidence/observations however.
The tailskid assembly (Photo: AAIU) A Ryanair Boeing 737-800, registration EI-DYD performing flight FR-208 from Dublin (Ireland) to London Stansted,EN (UK) with 148 passengers and 6 crew, struck its tail onto Dublin's runway 28. The crew continued the takeoff, climbed to FL120, where the crew donned their oxygen masks due to loss of cabin pressure, declared emergency and descended with ATC clearance for a return to Dublin, where the airplane landed safely on runway 28 21 minutes after departure.The Irish AAIU released their final report concluding that:the aircraft was depressurised manually at FL120 by the Flight Crew while carrying out a Non-Normal Checklist subsequent to a low-severity tailstrike event.Contributory Causes were:- Allowing the aircraft to climb and pressurise while the nature of the problem was not clearly established.- Actioning a Non-Normal Checklist without fully appreciating the consequences of such action.The captain was pilot flying to the sector to Stansted, a non-derated takeoff with flaps 5 was planned. The airplane was cleared to climb to FL230 on departure. While the airplane rotated for takeoff, the flight crew became aware of a bump but were not sure what had occured. After the after takeoff checklists had been processed and the airplane was in a stable climb, the captain handed controls to the first officer to permit the captain assess the problem, which took about 4 minutes, during which the airplane climbed through 10000 feet. The captain came to the conclusion, that a tailstrike had most likely occured and contacted a flight attendant, who confirmed a tail strike had occured. The captain resumed the role of the pilot flying and called for the Non-Normal Checklist (NNC) "tailstrike on takeoff". The airplane climbed to FL120 and remained on that level for about 40 seconds, then commenced a descent upon clearance by ATC.While processing the NNC the pressurization outflow valve was opened to depressurize the cabin. As the airplane was not above 14000 feet, the passenger oxygen masks did not deploy automatically, the cabin altitude horn however sounded prompting the crew to don their oxygen masks before completing the checklist.Cabin crew noticed that a depressurization had occured and attempted to raise the cockpit, however the flight crew was just busy donning their oxygen masks and didn't hear the call. After bumping the cockpit door the cabin crew called again and told the flight crew, that the cabin had depressurized but the oxygen masks had not dropped. The flight crew therefore released the oxygen masks manually.The AAIU found the tail skid assembly had some superficial scoring on its shoe and the tail skid had not been compressed sufficiently to render the airplane unservieable. The green mark on the tail skid indicating, that the airplane was serviceable, remained visible.The selection of flaps 5 gives a minimum tail clearance of 51cm on takeoff rotation on 737-800 and 737-900 types.The captain said in post flight interviews, that cabin crew had alerted the cockpit of smoke in the cabin some time before the cabin altitude alert activated.The AAIU analysed, that the center of gravity could not be determined with certainty however was within limits. The tailstrike in itsself was not a serious event in itsself, however developed into a serious incident through the following chain of events.The commander was correct in handing controls to the first officer, however it would been more prudent to level off immediately at a safe altitude, fully identify the nature of the event and then complete the relevant checklists. At low altitude the opening of the outflow pressure valve would not have been problematic.The NNC is designed to prevent the airframe from pressurizing in case, the airframe had received such damage that a sudden decompression could occur. As the airplane had already climbed to FL120 and had no damage, the execution of the NNC caused a depressurization of the aircraft. Had the crew considered the reesult of the checklist for a moment, they would have recognized, that the aircraft would be depressurized by the checklist items.The AAIU also analysed, that it was apparent that only the cabin purses recognized the severity of the situation, when the cabin depressurized and took immediate correct action to inform the flight deck.Two safety recommendations were issued to the operator as result of the investigation.
A Yellow-billed kite (Photo: Chell Hill) A South African Airways Airbus A319-100, flight SA-601 from Durban to Cape Town (South Africa), rejected takeoff from Durban after an engine ingested a Yellow-billed Kite resulting in smoke being emitted from the engine. The airplane slowed safely, emergency services responded.SAA reported, that it was nothing serious, the pilot took all necessary precautions. The passengers disembarked normally and were flown to Cape Town on another aircraft.South African media cite a passenger on Comair flight MN-6300 preparing for departure from Durban to Cape Town at that time, who reported their flight attendant remarked on the PA: "If you look out of the left hand windows you'll notice the SAA's engine on fire. Aren't you glad you're not flying SAA?"
A Turkish Airlines Airbus A340-300, flight TK-20 (scheduled dep Dec 10th, actual dep Dec 11th) from Istanbul Ataturk (Turkey) to Beijing (China), could not retract the gear after takeoff and returned to Istanbul's Ataturk Airport for a safe landing.A replacement Airbus A340-300 reached Beijing with a total delay of 8:20 hours.Passenger Gerry Mattios reported, that sitting in seat row 1 he heard noises from the nose gear leading him to believe, that the right hand nose gear door did not close properly producing flapping sounds and vibrations of the airframe. The gear was recycled 4 times at different speeds of up to 280 knots above ground in an attempt to resolve the issue while the airplane was at 11000 feet (according to indications on the inflight entertainment system showing position and speed data). After landing back the passengers disembarked via open stairs onto the apron in cold wind and rain, a look onto the nose gear did not reveal anything unusual. The crew just announced, they'd need to return to Istanbul because something was wrong with the airplane. 
A Pantanal Aerospatiale ATR-42-300, registration PT-MFV performing flight P8-4788 from Sao Paulo Congonhas,SP to Juiz de Fora,MG (Brazil), returned to Congonhas Airport when smoke appeared in the cabin due to a fault in the cabin lighting shortly after takeoff. The airplane landed safely.
A Finnair Embraer ERJ-170, registration OH-LEG performing flight AY-3661 from Helsinki (Finland) to Brussels (Belgium), rejected takeoff at high speed on command of the tower controller, when a foreign cargo airplane appeared to enter the runway. The Embraer slowed safely, the cargo plane stopped short of the runway but past the hold short line.The Embraer reached Brussels with a delay of 20 minutes.According to the airport the minimum distance between the aircraft was 750 meters. The cargo aircraft taxied beyond the hold short line to cross the runway most likely due to a misunderstanding with air traffic control. The cargo plane was told to immediately stop, too.
A Garuda Indonesia Boeing 737-400, registration PK-GWT performing flight GA-183 from Medan to Jakarta (Indonesia) with 134 passengers, rejected takeoff at high speed when the crew noticed severe vibrations of the airframe. The airplane slowed safely and stopped on the runway, a left main gear tyre was found deflated.The airport had to be closed for 4.5 hours until the airplane was towed off the runway after the tyre had been replaced.Maintenance determined, that the tyre deflated during the slow down and was not the cause of the vibration. The airplane was taken out of service for further examination.A replacement aircraft was dispatched to Medan to complete the flight.
A Condor Boeing 767-300, registration D-ABUF performing flight DE-1233 from Punta Cana (Dominican Republic) to Frankfurt/Main (Germany), could not completely retract the gear after takeoff from Punta Cana, the crew received a message of disagreeing gear doors and decided to return to Punta Cana. The aircraft landed safely 145 minutes later.
An American Airlines Boeing 777-200, registration N787AL performing flight AA-900 from Buenos Aires Ezeiza,BA (Argentina) to Miami,FL (USA), rejected takeoff at low speed due to a failed weather radar. The airplane slowed safely and returned to the gate.The airplane was repaired and reached Miami with a delay of 110 minutes.A passenger on board reported, that the airplane had accelerated to about 30-50 knots when the brakes came on, the captain later explaining the weather radar had failed. After the airplane returned to the gate, mechanics came on board for about one hour then released the airplane for flight. The airplane departed with a delay of approximately 2.5 hours.
A Donavia Boeing 737-400, flight D9-626 from Chulman to Novosibirsk (Russia), rejected takeoff at high speed close to V1 from Chulman.The flight had to be subsequently cancelled, the locals were sent home, other passengers taken to hotels to wait for the next day's flight.The airline did not report why the takeoff was rejected.
A Condor Airbus A320-200, registration D-AICL performing flight DE-6988 from Hanover (Germany) to Fuerteventura,CI (Spain), could not retract the gear after takeoff from Hanover. The crew decided to divert to Berlin Schoenefeld, where the airplane landed safely.A replacement Airbus A320-200 registration D-AICG is estimated to reach the Canary Islands with a delay of 8.5 hours.
The crew of an Air Europa Boeing 737-800, registration EC-III performing flight UX-664 from Trondheim (Norway) to Las Palmas,CI (Spain) with 170 passengers, shut down the right hand engine (CFM56) shortly after takeoff when they received indications of an engine problem. The crew returned to Trondheim, where the airplane landed safely about 30 minutes after departure.A replacement Boeing 737-800 registration EC-HJP was flown in and departed Trondheim with a delay of 8:15 hours.Engineers determined, that the affected engine needs to be replaced, a replacement engine is being trucked from Spain to Trondheim and estimated to arrive during the weekend.Passengers reported, that they heard a loud bang and afterwards observed flames out of the engine.Norway's AIBN rated the compressor stall a (not serious) incident.
A Central Mountain Air Beech 1900D, registration C-FCMO performing flight GLR-774 from Rainbow Lake,AB to Edmonton,AB (Canada) with 14 passengers and 2 crew, rejected takeoff from snow covered runway 09 past V1, when a stall warning activated at V1. The airplane came to a stop 100 feet (30 meters) past the runway end. No injuries and no damage occured. NAV Canada reported, that the stall warning vane showed moisture on both faceplate and the vane, although the heater will normally boil the moisture from the heated area. Maintenance did not report, whether the heater was not selected on or had failed.
Main gear tyre tracks past the runway (Photo: NTSC) A Mandala Airlines Boeing 737-200, registration PK-RIM performing flight RI-91 from Medan to Jakarta (Indonesia) with 112 passengers and 5 crew, got briefly airborne during takeoff from runway 23, but settled back onto the runway, overran the end of the runway and impacted buildings before coming to a stop on a public road 540 meters past the runway end. 95 passengers, all 5 crew and 49 people on the ground were killed. 15 passengers and 26 people on the ground received serious injuries. 2 passengers, a mother and her child, remained uninjured.The Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee NTSC released their final report concluding:- The aircraft took-off with improper take off configuration namely with retracted flaps and slats causing the aircraft failed to lift off.- Improper checklist procedure execution had lead to failure to identify the flap in retract position.- The aircrafts take off warning horn was not heard on the CAM channel of the CVR. It is possible that the take-off configuration warning horn was not sounding.The NTSC was not able to determine, whether captain or first officer was pilot flying for the sector from Medan to Jakarata.Takeoff preparation, taxi and align with the runway appeared normal, computed Vr was 149 knots. The airplane accelerated on a normal acceleration profile until rotation, the cockpit voice recorder recorded no sound of the takeoff configuration horn. The airplane rotated to a higher than normal attitude but remained on the ground until about 168 knots, then climbed to about 80 feet AGL, stalled and settled back onto the runway resulting in the tail contacting the 100 meter long stopway past the runway end about 39 meters past the runway end for a 24 meters and then again contacting the 60 meters long overrun area following the stopway leaving a 58 meter long scrape mark until the end of the paved surface, both scrape marks about 7.3 meters to the right of the runway centerline. All main gear tyres left marks on the runway and in the grass, no nose gear tracks could be detected. The airplane began to break up while running over soft ground and impacting approach lights. The right hand engine was found 300 meters past the runway end, the left hand engine and landing gear about 400 meters past the runway end. The fuselage travelled across a small river, impacted buildings on the other bank 540 meters past the runway end and burst into flames damaging a total of 30 houses, several cars and motorcycles. The fuselage and wings were largely consumed by the fires.The NTSC was able to recover parts of the slat and flaps mechanisms from the burned wreckage. Both slats and flaps mechanisms were in their retracted positions. The NTSC could not verify, whether the mechanisms were workable or had failed, as the actuators and controls were not available. Flaps asymmetry as cause of the flaps being in their retracted positions was ruled out however as all 6 recovered jackscrews were in about an identical position.The 30 minutes cockpit voice recorder was working, however the cockpit area microphon's (CAM) signal was overlaid by hum and noises consistent with an intermittent electrical wiring connection. The crew did not use their headsets, therefore the NTSC could not clearly hear their voices. The noise on the CAM made it also impossible to detect clicks and related sounds when levers and switches are operated. Only radio transmissions were recorded through the captain's and first officer's channels.The NTSC could therefore not use the CVR to determine, whether the crew executed the according checklists and operated the according levers in order to select the flaps into takeoff configuration.The CAM did record some of the cockpit sounds however. Even after extensive filtering of the hum and noises, which allowed to produce a (partial) transcript of events on the flight deck, the takeoff configuration horn and stick shaker could not be heard. The noise on the CAM makes it possible however, that the takeoff configuration warning sounded and the stick shaker activated, however were not audible on the CVR, on the other hand the CAM recorded several words and sounds the volumes of which are significantly below the takeoff configuration horn, which should have sounded continuously during the takeoff run.According to simulator tests the stick shaker should have continuously operated during the time the airplane was airborne.The engines had operated normally at takeoff thrust, examinations showed.Weight and balance were found well within limits, any weight and balance issue could be ruled out.8 safety recommendations were made.Slat mechanism found in retracted position (Photo: NTSC):
An Air Berlin Boeing 737-800, registration D-ABBH performing flight AB-6438 from Dusseldorf to Berlin Tegel (Germany), experienced a bump on takeoff past V1 from Dusseldorf, the crew continued the takeoff and decided to continue to Berlin when they received no abnormal indications. The airplane landed safely in Tegel, however one of the main gear tyres was found burst obviously during takeoff in Dusseldorf.
RH engine being worked on An Airtran Boeing 717-200, registration N982AT performing flight FL-206 from New York La Guardia,NY to Akron/Canton,OH (USA) with 114 passengers and 5 crew, rejected takeoff from La Guardia's runway 13 at low speed when the right hand engine's (BR700) fire alert activated in the cockpit and the engine emitted a loud bang. The airplane stopped safely, emergency services responded, no fire had occured. The airplane was towed to the apron.The runway was closed for a runway inspection for about 20 minutes, no debris was found. A replacement Boeing 717-200 registration N896AT reached Akron with a delay of 3:45 hours.A source at the airport reported, that the engine fire alert activated with the cause of the fire alert still being unknown prompting the crew to activate the fire extinguisher. The discharging fire bottle is assumed to have emitted the audible bang. An initial visual inspection revealed no damage to the engine.
An Air Canada Boeing 767-300, registration C-FTCA performing flight AC-63 from Vancouver,BC (Canada) to Seoul Incheon (South Korea), struck a flock of birds during takeoff from runway 08R. The crew decided to continue the flight and radioed ATC about the bird strike during climbout a few minutes later.A runway inspection revealed more than 50 dead birds on the runway. Several aircraft had to go around as a result, amongst them an arriving emergency, see Incident: Philippine Airlines A343 near Vancouver on Nov 5th 2009, lightning strike.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/ACA63/history/20091105/2005Z/CYVR/RKSI
A Flybe de Havilland Dash 8-400, registration G-JEDT performing flight BE-356 from Leeds,EN to London Gatwick,EN (UK), was struck by a lightning shortly after takeoff from Leeds. The crew decided to divert to Manchester,EN (UK) where the airplane landed safely.A replacement de Havilland Dash 8-400 registration G-JECX reached London with a delay of 2 hours.
A Porter Airlines de Havilland Dash 8-400, registration C-GLQN performing flight PD-266 from Halifax,NS to Ottawa,ON (Canada), was cleared for takeoff on Halifax' runway 32. Before commencing the takeoff the crew advised however, that there was still a truck on the runway. The truck subsequently vacated the runway and the airplane departed without further incident.The Canadian TSB reported, that the occurrence has been rated an operational irregularity by NAV Canada, who likely are going to conduct an Operations Safety Investigation (OSI).http://flightaware.com/live/flight/POE266/history/20091023/1735Z/CYHZ/CYOW
EP-CFO after evacuation (Photo: Henning Wiekhorst) An Iran Air Fokker 100, registration EP-CFO performing flight IR-220 from Isfahan to Tehran Mehrabad (Iran) with 99 passengers and 8 crew, returned to Isfahan due to a gear problem shortly after takeoff from runway 26R. During the landing on runway 26R the left hand main gear caught fire. The airplane came to a stop with a left wing low attitude. The passengers were evacuated. Emergency services were able to quickly put out the fire. No injuries occured.Runway 08L/26R had to be closed until the airplane could be moved off the runway about 8 hours later.The left hand main gear shock absorber was found broken, as a result the left hand wing tip had contacted the runway surface during the landing.Passenger Henning Wiekhorst felt a significant bump from the left hand main gear while the airplane was accelerating for takeoff and thought, they had gone over a pothole and later concluding, that it may also have been the breakage of a bolt. Shortly after takeoff the crew announced, that they needed to return to Isfahan due to a technical problem. No brace position was ordered. The airplane touched down normally initially, Henning thought no brakes were being used, later in the roll out the airplane rolled a bit left so that Henning felt the left main gear had partially collapsed. Just after standstill the aircraft fell onto its left wing. The airplane stopped on the runway with plenty of room to the left runway edge. The captain ordered to evacuate the airplane via the aircraft stairs, no slides were used. Henning did not observe any fire or emergency services extinguishing a fire.
A Delta Airlines Boeing 737-800, registration N378DA performing flight DL-494 from Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic) to New York JFK,NY (USA) with 142 passengers, was lined up on runway 17 and ready to depart, when two tyres burst.

An Air France Boeing 777-200, registration F-GSPY performing flight AF-455 from Sao Paulo Guarulhos,SP (Brazil) to Paris Charles de Gaulle (France), was lined up on the departure runway spooling the engines up for takeoff, when the crew noticed a problem with the right hand engine (GE90) and aborted takeoff. The airplane taxied back to the gate.The flight was cancelled 2.5 hours later.
A Qantas Boeing 747-400, registration VH-OJF performing flight QF-30 from Hong Kong (China) to Melbourne,VI (Australia) with 313 passengers, rejected takeoff at high speed after a loud bang was heard. The airplane stopped safely and was later towed to the apron.Qantas said, there was no cockpit indication of an engine failure, however damaged engine compressor blades requiring replacement were found in engine #4 (RB211, outer right) during an inspection. No evidence of a bird strike was found.The passengers were rebooked onto other flights or taken to local hotels.
An Air Canada Jazz Canadair CRJ-100, flight QK-8201 from Vancouver,BC to Prince George,BC (Canada), rejected takeoff from Vancouver's runway 12 after hitting multiple birds. The airplane slowed safely and returned to the apron for an inspection.A runway inspection showed more than 40 small dead birds on the runway. The runway was closed for about 20 minutes to remove the carcasses.
The broken hooks #2 and #3 (Photo: BFU) A MNG Airlines Airbus A300B4-203, registration TC-MNA performing freight flight MB-424 from Cologne-Bonn (Germany) to Istanbul Ataturk (Turkey) with 2 crew, rejected takeoff from Cologne's runway 14L at around 110 KIAS after the crew heard a loud bang from the left hand side of the airplane. The airplane slowed safely and returned to the apron.The German Buero fuer Flugunfalluntersuchungen (BFU) released their factual report as final report stating, that the core cowling of the airplane's left hand engine was damaged. The two halves of the cowling, covering the left and right hand side of engine with pivots at the upper side of the engine and hooks and eyes at the bottom of the engine, were bent backwards and torn. Hook number 1 (front) was intact, however hooks 2 and 3 were broken, the point of fracture showing evidence of a breakage under force. The spring of hook 3 tightening the safety catch was incomplete and bent, the holding pins of the safety catch were worn down, a part of locker's lever had separated. All eyes on the right side of the cowling were intact.The left hand cowling (Photo: BFU):The right hand cowling (Photo: BFU):
A Virgin Blue Australia Boeing 737-800, flight DJ-1432 from Darwin,NT to Perth,WA (Australia) with 89 passengers, returned to Darwin when the crew noticed vibrations of the right hand engine shortly after takeoff and suspected a bird strike. The airplane landed safely 20 minutes after departure.The flight had to be cancelled.Virgin Blue said, that examinations of the engine confirmed a bird strike.
Disconnected brake reaction rod (Photo: AAIB) A US Airways Airbus A330-300, registration N270AY performing flight US-735 from Manchester,EN (UK) to Philadelphia,PA (USA) with 250 passengers and 12 crew, rejected takeoff from Manchester's runway 23L at 120 KIAS when the crew noticed the engine pressure ratio (EPR) gauge of the left hand engine had failed. During the deceleration the brake pack on wheel #5 on the left hand main gear rotated and damaged the brakes hydraulics lines. The airplane slowed to taxi speed and was taxiing towards the apron, when two tyres deflated and the hydraulics fluid of the green system was completely lost.The AAIB released their report stating, that the failure of the EPR gauge was the result of a failure in a pressure sensing tube that supplied the full authority digital engine control (FADEC) on the left hand engine. During slowdown a pin attaching the brake reaction rod to the brakes unit suffered an overload failure, the pin being weakened by a previous undetermined event.The crew prepared for a flex takeoff on runway 23L, flaps were selected to 1, autobrakes were armed to MAX, V1 was 148 KIAS. While the airplane was accelerating, an ECAM caution message arrived, according to crew recollection it was either "AUTO FLT A/THR LIMITED" or "ENG THR LEVERS NOT SET". The first officer, pilot flying, assumed, that the levers may not be properly in the detent and selected TOGA on both engines. Now an ECAM caution "ENG 1 EPR MODE FAULT" was displayed. The crew discussed briefly, the commander decided to abort the takeoff and took control of the airplane. The decision to reject takeoff was taken at 120 KIAS, the airplane accelerated further to 130 KIAS before the airplane began to slow down. While on the runway the tower advised, that there was some smoke from the left hand main gear and asked, whether assistance was needed. The crew replied, they were going to continue, the brakes were warm.A runway inspection was carried out during which debris was found on the runway. The airplane in the meantime was taxiing back to the apron, when the crew noticed a very high brakes #1 temperature. The crew further noticed, that the green hydraulics system had lost the hydraulics fluid and one tyre had lost pressure. The crew decided to not continue to the apron but to hold at a position where emergency services could attend the aircraft. Stairs were brought to the airplane and passengers disembarked onto the taxiway.The ECAM caution message "ENG EPR MODE FAULT" indicates, that FADEC no longer has an EPR available and reverts to N1 mode (controlling the rpm of the N1 spool), autothrust is no longer available. The caution message is inhibited during the takeoff run at speeds greater than 80 KIAS until the aircraft is airborne.The FCOM recommends, that the captain should seriously consider discontinuing the takeoff if any ECAM caution/warning is activated below 100 KIAS. Above 100 KIAS the captain should be go-minded and very few situations should lead to the decision to reject takeoff, amongst them any amber ENG caution message.See the original incident report at: Incident: US Airways A333 at Manchester on May 29th 2008, rejected takeoff.
A Thomas Cook Airbus A330-200, registration G-OJMC performing flight MT-77 from Montego Bay (Jamaica) to London Gatwick,EN (UK) with 318 passengers and 13 crew, accelerated down Montego's runway 07 for takeoff and passed Vr, when the captain initiated takeoff rotation but the airplane did not get airborne. The commander increase thrust to TOGA and the airplane eventually climbed safely away. After reaching safe altitude the crew noticed, that their takeoff performance data had been 26 knots below target. The airplane continued to London, where the airplane landed safely.The AAIB released their report stating, that the flight crew consisted of a captain, a first officer and an additional A330 line captain also being A320/A321 instructor. The captain was pilot flying for the sector. The airplane's takeoff weight had been computed to 210.4 tonnes (463k lbs).The crew did not find the airplane's performance manual during preparations. The crew therefore called the airline's dispatch office to have the takeoff data computed by the Airbus Flight Operations Versatile Environment (FOVE) computerised system. This involved reading the data like takeoff weight, takeoff configuration, runway and weather data to dispatch by the captain, the data being read back by the dispatcher, the dispatcher then computing the performance data and reading them to the captain with an according read back. The phone was then transferred to the first officer and the process was repeated as a cross check. Both captain and co-pilot received the same set of performance data indicating a V1 and a Vr of 114 knots.These data were entered into the flight management and guidance system (FMGS). No pilot considered the speeds abnormal for the computed takeoff weight.When the airplane accelerated through 116 knots with engines operating at 82% N1, the commander applied back pressure on the side stick to initiate the takeoff rotation. At that point the airplane had travelled about 1100 meters down the 2663 meters long takeoff distance available. When the airplane had rotated to about 9 degrees nose up (about 1700 meters down the runway), the commander prevented the airplane from rotating further up, as the main gear was still on the ground. Subsequently the captain applied back pressure again to prevent the nose from dropping and to slightly increase pitch again reaching 10.2 degrees of pitch with the main gear still on the ground about 2000 meters down the runway. Maximum pitch on the ground should not exceed 9.5 degrees. The airplane accelerated through 143 knots at that point and the left main gear lifted off 10 seconds after the nose gear lifted off and about 2100 meters down the runway. The captain applied TOGA thrust upon liftoff, the engines accelerated to 91% N1. The airplane reached 50 feet AGL at an estimated 2500 meters down the runway and continued to climb out safely.Following the after takeoff checklists the crew decided to review the takeoff configuration with the generic performance data contained in the FCOM2 manual and found significant differences to the data used for takeoff.The flight continued without further incident. During descent to London the performance manual was found incorrectly stowed between navigation charts.The AAIB analysed, that the correct takeoff speeds would have been 136KIAS for V1 and 140 KIAS for Vr. The flex takeoff setting did not have impact on the takeoff performance as the runway would have been sufficient to accelerate to the correct reference speeds at that power setting. At the speed of 116 KIAS there was insufficient lift available. When the airplane accelerated through 138 KIAS reaching the correct Vr of 140 knots, the main gear lifted off.The log sheets of the dispatcher showed, that he had noted a takeoff weight of 120 tonnes instead of 210 tonnes, the computed takeoff speeds were consistent with a takeoff weight of 120 tonnes.A tail strike was avoided because the airplane needed a pitch of 11.5 degrees of pitch with shock absorbers uncompressed, while a maximum pitch of 9.5 degrees would lead to a tail strike with shock absorbers in the main gear being compressed.The AAIB took comparisms with the crash of the MK Airlines Boeing 747-200 in Halifax on Oct 14th 2004, the tailstrike of the Thomson Airways Boeing 767-300 in Manchester on Dec 13th 2008 and the tailstrike of the Emirates Airbus A340-500 in Melbourne on March 20th 2009. An incorrect takeoff weight had been used for takeoff computations in all three cases. The Canadian TSB had issued a safety recommendations following the crash in Halifax to develop a takeoff performance monitoring system to timely detect an inadequate takeoff performance. Work has been done on that subject, however by April 2009 none of the goals had been reached and no system was certifiable.The AAIB issued two safety recommendations: The European EASA should develop specifications for a takeoff performance monitoring system capable of warning about inadequate takeoff performance, and EASA should require air transport category airplanes to be equipped with the takeoff performance monitoring system.FDR data (Graphics: AAIB):
A warthog (Photo: Jlahorn) An Air Zimbabwe Xian MA-60, flight UM-239 from Harare to Bulawayo (Zimbabwe) with 34 passengers, struck a warthog during the takeoff run at Harare at 19:15L (17:15Z) in night conditions, veered off the runway and came to rest with one main gear strut collapsed. No inuries occured, the aircraft received substantial damage. The passengers were evacuated.The airline said, that the aircraft hit a warthog forcing emergency braking while the aircraft was taxiing on the runway.Zimbabwe's Transport Ministry said, that the airplane collided with five warthogs leading to the gear collapsing, the nose, an engine and one wing receiving substantial damages.Passengers reported, that the airplane was at high speed close to liftoff, when the left main gear strut collapsed, warthog caused or not, the airplane dropped on its left wing and left engine, skidded several hundred meters and veered off the runway. The left wing was seriously bent and buckled, especially in the outer third. The left propeller was destroyed, the blades impacting the left side of the fuselage. The fuselage received body damage where it impacted and slid along the runway.The passengers continued, that two journalists, who tried to film or photograph what was left of the airplane, were arrested by Zimbabwean security forces, who arrived well before the emergency services. The journalists' equipment was confiscated.Air Zimbabwe operates three Xian MA-60s (Z-WPJ,Z-WPK and Z-WPL) on their domestic routes since 2005/2006.Tuesday's (Nov 3rd) morning flight UM-224 was scheduled to be performed by the same airframe, however had been cancelled due to "technical issues".

Theoretic and actual lift curves (Graphics: MAK) The Russian Interstate Aviation Committee (MAK) have released their final report in Russian concluding, that the most probable cause of the crash was:- the asymmetric loss of aerodynamics properties of the wing during takeoff, which resulted in stalling the aircraft immediately after liftoff, the left wing contacting the runway and the subsequent destruction and fire.- The reason for the loss of aerodynamics properties of the wing in the current weather conditions was frost contaminating the surfaces of the wings. The cause of the frost contamination was, most likely, the temperature difference of air and cold fuel in the tanks. - Takeoff below the recommended safe speed for contaminated wings aggravated the situation. - The current standard procedures to examine the aerodynamic surfaces before departure, along with the inefficiency, can not fully guarantee the preventions of similiar accidents during takeoff in the future because of the high sensitivity of the wing, that does not permit even a slight contamination of the leading edge.- Deicing of the wings as required by an Airworthiness Directive by Transport Canada (Canada's Civil Aviation Authority) in the actual weather conditions released after another similiar accident most likely could have prevented the accident.The airplane, a Canadair CRJ-100LR registration EW-101PJ, had arrived at Yerevan 2 hours before scheduled departure and was now preparing for departure as flight B2-1834 from Yerevan (Armenia) to Minsk 2 (Belarus) with 18 passengers and 3 crew. 2200 liters (1802kg) of Jet-A-1 fuel were added to the tanks, refueling was done in automatic mode 25 minutes after landing. Due to reported reducing visibility at the main alternate airport the crew decided to add another 400 liters of fuel about 30 minutes later during flight preparation. The first officer - not the pilot in command although required in weather conditions, that are suspectible to frost contamination - performed the preflight check of the aircraft about 15 minutes after landing (and before refueling) and found all aerodynamics surfaces clean and dry by visual inspection as well as by touching the surfaces with the palm of his hand.The weather at the time was: winds from 110 degrees at 2 knots, visibility 3500 meters (11500 feet) in light haze, clouds overcast at 2600 feet, scattered at 9800 feet, temperature -3 degrees Centigrade, dew point -4 degrees centigrade and QNH 1019 hPa.The crew computed V1 at 137, Vr at 139 and V2 at 145 knots.After engine start the crew activated the anti-ice systems of the engines, the wing anti-ice systems were not activated.The airplane banked progressively left after liftoff until the left wing touched the ground with the airplane veering left of the runway, rolled right separating the right hand wing, crossed the runway rolling on its back and disintegrated coming to rest right of the runway. Leaking fuel triggered a ground fire, which was quickly brought under control by the airport fire fighters. 7 passengers received serious injuries, the other 11 passengers and the 3 crew remained unhurt.The MAK performed a test employing a CRJ-900 registration D-ACKK to assess the accumulation and freeze of atmosperic moisture with large temperature differences between the ambient air and the remaining fuel in the tanks after landing. It was found, that ice accumulated on the underside of the wing immediately after landing and grew 25 minutes after landing upon refueling. The upper side of the wing showed dew accumulation after refueling. The fuel temperature at the time of arrival was measured at -21 degrees Centigrade, before departure at -12 degrees Centigrade with an ambient temperature of plus 8 degrees Centigrade. At the time of the accident it can be assumed, that the temperature of the fuel in EW-101PJ never got above -12 degrees Centigrade with an ambient temperature of -3 degrees.First impact mark of left wing (Photo: MAK):Tracks to the left of the runway (Photo: MAK):Track across the runway (Photo: MAK):

A Transaero Airlines Boeing 737-300, registration EI-CXR performing flight UN-101 from Moscow Domodedovo to St. Petersburg (Russia) with 41 passengers and 6 crew, lost a leading edge fairing of its right hand wing during takeoff from Domodedovo Airport. The crew decided to continue to St. Petersburg, where the airplane landed safely and on schedule.Sources at St. Peterburg's Pulkovo Airport had reported, that a part of 60 by 80 centimeters (24 by 31 inches) had separated from the wing of the airplane. A runway inspection found and recovered the part.Konstantin Tyurkin, spokesman for Transaero Airlines, told The Aviation Herald, that the crew decided to continue the flight as the part didn't impact safety. The reason for this part going missing is being investigated.

European Kestrel (Photo: AAIU) The Air Accident Investigation Unit (AAIU) of Belgium's Service public fédéral Mobilité et Transports have released their final report concluding, that the accident was caused by the decision to reject the takeoff 12 knots after passing V1 speed. Contributing factors were:- Engine Nr 3 experienced a bird strike, causing it to stall. This phenomenon was accompanied by a loud bang, noticed by the crew.- The aircraft line up at the B1 intersection although the take-off parameters were computed with the full length of the runway.- The situational awareness of the crew,- Less than maximum use of deceleration devices.- Although the RESA conforms to the minimum ICAO requirement, it does not conform to the ICAO recommendation for length.The crew had briefed a departure from runway 20. The crew determined, that they needed the full length of the runway for takeoff. The briefing included procedures to reject takeoff before V1 as well as rejecting takeoff after V1 if the airplane was unable to fly. The decision speed V1 was computed at 138 KIAS and the speed to rotate at 157 KIAS. After a normal pre-flight check and departure preparation the airplane taxied towards runway 20 at the B1 intersection leaving 312 meters (1023 feet) less available distance for takeoff than the full length (2987 meters/9797 feet). The airplane was cleared to takeoff from B1 intersection. The crew was not aware, that they were not using the full length of the runway and their takeoff distance had been reduced by 312 meters and thought, they'd still have their takeoff margin of 300 meters.A few seconds after reaching V1 (138 KIAS) engine #3 (inner right, JT9D-7Q) ingested a bird. 5 seconds after V1 the engine stalled and produced a loud bang as well as a vibration noticed by the crew. The captain felt, that the airplane was no longer accelerating and decided to reject takeoff about 2 seconds later (7 seconds after V1). The thrust levers were brought to idle and braking action was initiated, the thrust reversers were not deployed. The first officer called tower they were going into the overrun. The captain turned the airplane a few degrees to the right to avoid the approach lights. The airplane left the runway at a speed of 72 knots, went over a first embankment, dropped 4 meters (13 feet), broke into three parts and stopped just above the railway embankment. The crew exited through the L1 door.The report states, that the crew received minor injuries, the airplane was totally destroyed.The bird ingested was identified to be a European Kestrel ("Falco Tinnunculus", see picture at the top). Its organic remains were recovered from each stage of the low pressure compressor, fan blades, bleed valve linkage support and sound absorbing segments of engine #3. Engine #4 was inspected as well though to a lesser extent, after two fan blades showed indications of organic debris. Sound analysis of the cockpit voice recorder showed, that engine #3 was recovering following the bird strike until the moment, when the captain closed the throttle levers. The flight data recorder recorded the engine parameters only every 4 seconds. The flight data recorder stored an EPR value of about 0.1 less than the other engines for engine #3 just prior to the onset of the braking action.The engine stalled at about mid length of the runway at a point, where the downslope of the runway increased from 0.62% to 0.93%. This might have contributed to the impression of the crew, that the airplane did no longer accelerate.N704CK had experienced 27 engine related incidents since January 2004, well above average of the Kalitta fleet. Engine #3 had been replaced one month before the accident after a fire warning. Engine #4 had been recently replaced without an incident related reason.The captain had experienced an engine failure associated with a loud bang during takeoff from Incheon Airport (Seoul, South Korea) a few years earlier, which was a genuine engine failure. The captain was aware of 12 engine related incidents during takeoffs in the entire Kalitta fleet since 2004, 4 of them on N704CK. The bang heard in Brussels was as loud, if not louder, than the one the crew heard in Incheon, giving the impression that the event may be worse than the event in Incheon.Each of the engine related incidents on N704CK happened with a different engine, the high rate of incidents seems coincidental.The inflight shut down rate of the JT9D engines in the Kalitta fleet is higher than the world average, mostly due to Kalitta policy of precautionary shut downs.The Runway End Safety Area (RESA) is required to extend for 90 meters past the runway end at a width of 90 meters according to ICAO regulations. The actual RESA of runway 20 complies with that regulation, however does not fulfill the recommendation of the same regulation to extend the RESA to 240 meters in length.Had runway 20 been equipped with an Engineered Material Arrestor System (EMAS), a specifically designed surface to stop airplanes during an overrun, and had N704CK not turned right, the airplane would have been stopped before the first ditch using an EMAS, computations by the accident investigators showed.Overview of runway and overrun area (Photo: AAIU):Track of aircraft (Graphics: NTSB):
A JAL Japan Airlines Boeing 747-400, registration JA8073 performing flight JL-11 from Mexico City (Mexico) to Vancouver,BC (Canada) and further on to Tokyo Narita (Japan), was lined up on the runway and accelerated the engines, when one of the engines did not reach takeoff thrust prompting the crew to reject takeoff, turn off the runway and taxi back to the apron.The flight was postponed by 24 hours, however could not depart again as the same engine problem surfaced again. The flight is now scheduled to depart on a replacement aircraft with a delay of 48 hours.An organised youth travel group, the youngsters travelling without parents, was on board of the flight causing some "frantic panic" to the organisers to get the parents waiting for their children informed about the delay.
A Cyprus Airways Airbus A330-200, registration 5B-DBS performing flight CY-327 from London Heathrow,EN (UK) to Larnaca (Cyprus), rejected takeoff at low speed due to an engine problem (Trent 772). The airplane returned to the apron.The airplane was repaired, departed again and reached Larnaca with a delay of 3:45 hours.A passenger on board reported, that the crew told them an engine problem had occured. Later ground personnel said, it had been an indication problem.
A Thomson Airways Boeing 767-300, registration G-OOAN performing flight BY-291 from Manchester,EN (UK) to Montego Bay (Jamaica) with 254 passengers and 11 crew, suffered a tailstrike during takeoff. The airplane got airborne, the crew dumped fuel and returned to Manchester for a safe landing. No injuries occured, the airplane suffered minor (paint) damage to the tail skid.The Air Accident Investigation Board (AAIB) of the United Kingdom released their preliminary report stating, that the airplane was during the takeoff roll with the first officer being pilot flying, when the commander noticed a "sluggish acceleration" and thought, that the airplane was heavier than expected, and delayed the "V1" call by 10-15 knots. During rotation the "tailskid" message illuminated briefly. The commander applied maximum takeoff thrust, the stick shaker activated briefly. The airplane continued to climb away and accelerated, before the flaps were retracted and the after takeoff checklist was completed.The crew advised ATC and was informed, that no debris was discovered on the runway. The tailskid checklists were actioned, fuel was dumped and the airplane returned to Manchester for a safe landing.The aircraft sustained just scratches to the tail skid paint. Engineers declared the airplane airworthy after about 20 minutes.The copilot reported later, that the zero fuel weight had been entered as takeoff weight into the Computer Take Off Programme (CTOP). This error was discovered after landing. The resulting takeoff speeds were 20 knots less than with correct takeoff weight. The copilot commented however, that the FMS would automatically sum zero fuel weight and fuel weight, so that the FMS would have used the correct takeoff weight and therefore the flaps schedule speeds would have been correct.The captain had flown 6 empty sectors before the incident flight and was therefore accustomed to slow takeoff speeds, so that the speeds resulting from the CTOP did not trigger any concern with him. Time pressures due to a late push back led to some additional distraction.Both crew received some additional training on the use of the CTOP. The operator now requires crew to extract the actual takeoff mass from the load sheet rather than use the figures on the operational flight plan.
The captain of a bmibaby Boeing 737-300, registration G-OGBE performing flight WW-1001 from Birmingham,EN to Edinburgh,SC (UK) with 100 passengers and 5 crew, rejected takeoff at 155 KIAS well beyond V1 (126 KIAS) and Vr (132 KIAS) when the copilot - pilot flying - could not rotate the airplane for liftoff. The airplane stopped safely on the runway.The Air Accident Investigation Board (AAIB) of the United Kingdom released a preliminary report stating, that the stabilizer trim had not been properly set. However, simulator tests showed, that rotation was achievable though with higher control forces than normal.The airplane was about to depart at takeoff weight of 46779 kg (103,030 lbs), according to the tables for wet runways the decision speed (V1) was computed to be 126 KIAS and the speed to rotate (Vr) at 132 knots. Stabilizer trim was required at 4.5 units.Due to poor weather, snowfall and temperatures around 0 degrees Centigrade the airplane had to be de-iced. While working the pre-flight checklist, the stabilizer trim could not be set because of the ongoing de-icing. The crew decided to taxi out with flaps up due to the slush on the taxiways, the trim setting was not checked.After arriving at the holding point the crew selected flaps for the takeoff. The snowfall had become moderate to heavy. Just before the captain had set the last takeoff time (considering the worsening time and the de-icing necessary) the copilot as pilot flying was able to commence the takeoff roll. At Vr he used a normal pull to rotate the nose, the nose gear got shortly off the ground enough to trigger airborne mode, but returned onto the ground having the airplane return to ground mode. He pulled again now "doubling his effort", however, the airplane did not rotate. The copilot now called the captain to inform him about the situation. The captain was aware of the lack of rotation and decided to reject takeoff 4 seconds after the first attempt to rotate the aircraft. The speed was under control with 900 meters of runway remaining permitting brakes to be reduced. The airplane exited the runway at the upwind end. Emergency services inspected the brakes and cleared the aircraft to taxi back to the apron.During taxi back the crew noticed, that the stabilizer trim was at 3 units instead of the required 4.5 units as per loadsheet. Back at the stand fire services inspected the brakes again and found no danger. No evidence of restricted controls was found.The flight data recorder showed, that pitch trim was set at 2.3 units. At 135 knots the control column was pulled back by 7 degrees prompting the airplane to rotate the nose up by 1 degrees, the nose gear however came back down onto the ground almost immediately. The takeoff was rejected from a speed of 155 knots.The captain said in interviews, that he was very aware of the point until which a takeoff could be rejected. He also was aware of the hold over times, the snowfall and the possibility of ice-accretion. When the copilot said he couldn't rotate the aircraft, he assessed the remaining runway and judged, that there was sufficient runway ahead and the airplane was unable to fly, and decided to reject takeoff.The AAIB analysed, that when the captain saw the lack of rotation, his concerns about ice-accretion were reinforced and he made the decision to reject takeoff above V1. Self evidently the airplane had sufficient runway to stop from 155 KIAS.
An Air France Airbus A340-300, registration F-GLZP performing flight AF-174 from Paris Charles de Gaulle (France) to Bangkok (Thailand) with 271 passengers, ingested a bird into one of its engine during takeoff resulting in engine vibrations.

A Turkish Airlines Boeing 737-800, registration TC-JGO performing flight TK-1462 from Simferopol (Ukraine) to Istanbul Ataturk (Turkey) with 82 passengers, burst the left outer tyre on takeoff from Simferopol, which was discovered only, when a later runway inspection revealed tyre debris on the runway. The crew was radioed about the possible tyre burst and decided to perform a low approach to the Ataturk Airport to have the tower inspect the landing gear. The tower confirmed that the left outer tyre had burst, but did not see any further damage. The airplane landed safely without any further incident.
Both wings broken at the root (Photo: AICC) The Maldivian Accident Investigation Coordinating Committee (AICC) released their preliminary report stating, that the casual factors leading to the accident were:- the pilot in command's decision to fly the aircraft, other than for takeoff and landing, lower than an altitude allowed by regulations and operator manuals.- a passenger occupying the co-pilot seat.- no effective means established by the operator to ensure, that amendments to the regulations, guidance, procedures are communicated to the crew appropriately and in a timely manner.The airplane had taken off Halaveli's floating platform for a photo flight in a westerly direction. After the airplane had levelled off, the first officer gave his seat to the cameraman (passenger) as permitted by regulations for photo flights. The airplane made a couple of right hand orbits at the initial levelled height, then descended and flew a couple more orbits around the lagoon. The passengers informed, they had all photos they wanted and the aircraft could now land. The captain descended and made another right turn to give the cameraman, keeping him in the co-pilot seat, a different view. Before the turn was completed, the right wing and/or float hit the water. One passenger and one crew member received minor injuries.The airplane received substantial damage. Both wings were broken off at the root, the aircraft nose was crushed, the underside of the belly badly damaged. Both engines were intact, but the blades of both propellers severely damaged. The forward end of the right float was cut by the propeller and detached, the left float had detached. The empennage was twisted anticlockwise upside down. The airplane came to rest in water of about 1 meter's depth.Nearby corals received damage in the accident, too, but the damage was not assessed.Weight and Balance were within limits. The flight was performed under visual flight rules in daylight (10:05 local) and with visibility at or above 10km and scattered clouds at 1800 feet. The airplane was not equipped with a cockpit voice or flight data recorder (none required by regulations).Special regulations for photo flights required, that both pilots were at the controls for takeoff and landing, however permitted a passenger in the right hand (copilot's) seat during other stages of the flight at or above permitted minimum altitude. During the investigation it became apparent, that neither of the crew knew the regulations in full, the crew was also not aware of amendments made to the regulations, that were published on the Maldivian Civil Aviation Department's website.The twisted empennage (Photo: AAIC):Flight Path (Graphics: AAIC):
A Cimber Air Canadair CRJ-200 on behalf of SAS Scandinavian Airlines, registration OY-RJE performing flight QI-1871/SK-1871 from Stavanger (Norway) to Copenhagen (Denmark) with 49 passengers, rejected takeoff from Stavanger at high speed due to an alert in the cockpit. The airplane stopped safely on the runway, the crew initiated an evacuation via the airplane's stairs due to a strong burning smell from the brakes. Arriving emergency crews could not detect any source of heat or fire except hot brakes.The flight had to be cancelled.There are conflicting reports of a flaps problem (takeoff configuration alert) or an unspecified fire alert.
An Allegiant Air McDonnell Douglas MD-83, registration N876GA performing flight G4-506 from Fresno Yosemite,CA to Las Vegas,NV (USA) with 100 passengers, returned to Fresno after a loud bang from and the failure of the right hand engine while climbing through FL190 about 10 minutes after takeoff.

The crew aborted the takeoff and returned to the gate.A replacement Embraer ERJ-190 registration PR-AZD resumed the flight with a delay of 4 hours.The left hand engine had suffered a compressor stall due to a faulty FADEC. The FADEC was replaced. 
A Japan Airlines Boeing 747-400, registration JA8083 performing flight JL-914 from Okinawa to Tokyo Haneda (Japan) with 484 passengers, was waiting for takeoff clearance on the departure runway, when a passenger with a 15 cm long screwdriver walking along the aisle towards the cockpit was noticed by a flight attendant, who alerted the cockpit. The passenger returned to his seat. The captain decided to abort takeoff preparations and taxied the airplane back to the gate, where the passenger was arrested.The airplane departed again about one hour later.Charges of attempted interference with flight crew have been filed against the passenger. The police said, that the man has admitted to the charges however without providing a motive.According to Japanese regulations, screwdrivers up to 20cm in length are not prohibited.
A US Airways Airbus A319-100, registration N763US performing flight US-1937 from Philadelphia,PA to West Palm Beach,FL (USA), rejected takeoff from Philadelphia at high speed due to severe vibrations during the takeoff roll.

A US Airways Airbus A320-200, registration N662AW performing flight US-27 from Boston,MA to Phoenix,AZ (USA) with 84 passengers and 5 crew, was just accelerating for takeoff on runway 15R, when a construction truck entered the runway without clearance and without stopping at the holding point.The crew saw the obstacle about 60 seconds after receiving the takeoff clearance and reported on the tower frequency "there is a car on the runway there", to which the controller replied "we are fighting that out as we speak, Sir". The takeoff was continued.The FAA reported, the the truck cleared the runway just moments before the airplane passed through the intersection during its takeoff run. The serious incident will be investigated. The airport driving license of the truck driver has been suspended.The NTSB reported, that the construction vehicle, a Ford Explorer, had crossed runway 15R at taxiway M without authorization. The Airbus rotated about 500 feet before the intersection just as the vehicle had cleared the runway edge to the south. The tower controller was aware of the vehicle operating on the taxiway, but not of its intention to cross the runway. The driver was not in radio contact with the tower. The ground radar alerted the tower controller to the conflict.The NTSB explained, that taxiway M is currently being reconstructed. For that purpose runway 15R is occasionally closed. During those times signage indicates the runway closure. That signage was not present at the incident time, the construction workers had also been briefed to the fact, that the runway was active. The driver indicated however, that he had not been briefed. The driver has been suspended from driving on the airport pending the investigation. The airport authority decided to suspend all construction work pending the investigation as well.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/USA27/history/20090618/1041Z/KBOS/KPHX

Map (Graphics: ATSB) The Australian Transportation Safety Board (ATSB) released their final report stating, that after the Airbus began the takeoff roll, the tower controller advised they had no takeoff clearance, so that the crew discontinued the takeoff.The crew had been planning and prepared a departure from runway 34L. While taxiing to the runway, air traffic control inquired whether the crew could accept a departure from runway 25. The crew recalculated the performance and accepted runway 25, however, underestimated the shortened taxi time and the impact on their briefing. While taxiing on taxiway Golf, the crew reported ready for departure and was cleared to line up runway 25 and hold, fly heading 240. The takeoff clearance however was withheld, as a Boeing 737 was cleared to cross the runway at taxiway Bravo. That reason however was not provided to the Airbus crew. The Boeing was on a different radio frequency, so that the Airbus crew was not aware of the Boeing at all.The Airbus crew read back their clearance, however without the "and hold" portion, the tower controller did not challenge the missing hold.The aircraft lined up runway 25 and commenced the takeoff without having received the takeoff clearance. A tower controller saw the aircraft moving and instructed the crew to hold position, which was queried by the crew. The controller then instructed the crew to cancel the takeoff, to which the crew reacted and aborted the takeoff. The Sydney ground radar showed, that the airplane had reached a maximum speed of 29 knots. The Airbus subsequently vacated the runway and returned to the holding point, where a takeoff clearance was issued. The aircraft departed without further incident.The Australian Manual of Air Traffic Services (MATS) required, that controllers should issue traffic information as appropriate and should advise crew of the "nature of obstructions if it is not apparent", when aircraft are delayed by the traffic situation.The ICAO Procedures for Air Navigation Services specified, that a departure instruction may be combined with a takeoff clearance, however did not provide the option to combine a departure instruction with the line up clearance.The MATS however permitted the combination of a departure instruction with the line up clearance.The ATSB said, that the combination of the departure instruction with the line up clearance provided an ambiguity to the flight crew, who were not used to hear such a combination. The inclusion of the reason for the delayed takeoff clearance could have reduced the likelihood of a misunderstanding by the crew. The controller did not challenge the missing "and wait" in the readback missing another opportunity to remove any ambiguity. Instead of "stop immediately" the controller issued a "hold position" instruction, which was not understood by the crew so that they questioned what was being said. ATC phraseology should be clear, concise and unambiguous and should reflect international practises and standards where possible, especially with regards to instructions to international aircraft and in safety critical situations.The flight crew was distracted with departure preparations and provided themselves with little time to brief and comprehend the change to their departure. Had the crew not put themselves under that pressure, they may have been less distracted and may have correctly comprehended the ATC instructions. When the crew was instructed to line up and hold runway 25 combined with the departure instruction to fly heading 240, the crew erroneously took this as a takeoff clearance. The confusion was amplified by the departure instruction, which had only been heard together with a takeoff clearance before.Air Services Australia, responsible for providing Air Traffic Control, reviewed their procedures to bring them in line with the ICAO standards. The necessary changes to MATS will commence in the August 2009 release.
An American Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-83, registration N979TW performing flight AA-1317 from Washington National,DC to Dallas Ft.

About 4 minutes later the crew attempted another takeoff and rejected again at about 80 knots for the same reason.The Canadian TSB rported, that no evidence of an oil leak was found. About 1.5 quarts (approx. 1.5 liters) of oil were added, the engines were run satisfactorily and the airplane returned to service.The flight reached Quebec with a delay of 6:10 hours as a result.
A Fedex Airbus A300-600, registration N654FE performing freight flight FX-1351 from Phoenix,AZ to Long Beach,CA (USA) with 2 crew, diverted to Los Angeles,CA after witnesses had seen a part fall off the airplane during takeoff from Phoenix.A post flight inspection showed, that an air conditioning access panel near the left main gear had departed the airframe, the FAA reported.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/FDX1351/history/20090611/2343Z/KPHX/KLGB

The flight was cancelled, the passengers rebooked onto other flights.
A PSA Airlines Canadair CRJ-200 on behalf of US Airways, flight JIA-2390/US-2390 from Charlotte,NC to New Bern,NC (USA), had been cleared for takeoff on runway 18L in clear weather and visibility of 9 miles, while a private single engine plane was waiting to depart runway 18L from intersection A at the holding point. The private plane received clearance to taxi into position and hold on runway 18L while the CRJ-200 was already in the takeoff roll. While the single engine plane was taxiing into position, the pilot noticed the oncoming Canadair and pulled to the side. The Canadair crew noticed the runway incursion too and rejected their takeoff about 1600 feet (490 meters) into the takeoff run, shortly followed by the air traffic controller cancelling the takeoff clearance. The Canadair stopped about 10 feet from the private plane.The NTSB has opened an investigation and reported in their preliminary report, that the ground controller had verbally coordinated the departure of the private plane and put a note onto the flight strip about the departure from intersection A as required. The tower controller however had forgotten about the intersection and cleared the private plane into position. When the runway incursion warning activated, the tower controller cancelled the takeoff clearance.
A Sichuan Airlines Airbus A320-200, registration B-2397 performing flight 3U-8748 from Guangzhou to Chongqing (China) with 100 passengers, rejected takeoff from Guangzhou at high speed and stopped on the runway.The passengers were told by ground staff, that the crew had received an unsafe right main gear indication during the takeoff run.

The fumes were produced by residue fluids entering the cabin via the air conditioning system.
An Air India Airbus A310-300, flight AI-348 from Mumbai to Delhi (India) with 104 passengers and further on to Shanghai (China), was waiting for takeoff clearance on runway 27.A Jet Airways Boeing 737-800, flight 9W-615 from Mumbai to Kolkatta (India) with 120 passengers, was waiting for takeoff clearance on runway 14.Only the Jet Airways Boeing received takeoff clearance, however both aircraft started their takeoff runs simultaneously at around 07:54 local (02:24Z). A controller in the tower recognized the conflict and ordered the Air India Airbus to stop. Both aircraft rejected their takeoff.Air India said, that both aircraft received takeoff clearance on crossing runways and both takeoff clearances were cancelled by ATC.Jet Airways said, that their flight was cleared for takeoff, however the Air India crew mistook the clearance and was subsequently ordered to abort their takeoff. The Jet Airways crew rejected their takeoff as a precaution, too.Mumbai's Air Traffic Control did not comment on the incident.India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) ordered an investigation into the incident, requesting cockpit voice recorders and flight data recorders of both airplanes as well as radar and voice recordings of Mumbai's Air Traffic Control. According to the DGAC initial report the Jet Airways Boeing was cleared for takeoff, the Air India Airbus however started to roll, too. The Jet Airways Boeing was therefore ordered to abort takeoff.Review of the recorded evidence on June 1st suggests, that the Air India mistook the takeoff clearance for the Jet Airways for himself and started to roll, but was ordered by the tower to stop. No fault was found with the communication by the tower and the actions of the Jet Airways crew.Metars:VABB 310310Z 26007KT 5000 FU SCT020 SCT025 31/24 Q1006 NOSIGVABB 310210Z 22006KT 4000 FU FEW020 SCT025 30/25 Q1006 NOSIGVABB 310140Z 23006KT 4000 FU FEW020 SCT025 30/25 Q1005 NOSIGVABB 310110Z 24004KT 4000 FU FEW020 SCT025 30/25 Q1005 NOSIGVABB 310040Z 21003KT 4000 FU FEW020 SCT025 30/25 Q1005 NOSIGMap of Mumbai Airport (Courtesy Google Earth):
A SAS Norway Boeing 737-700, flight BU-4683/SK-4683 from Oslo Gardermoen (Norway) to Malaga,SP (Spain) with 134 passengers, had to return to Gardermoen Airport after the airspeed indicators started to disagree shortly after takeoff. The airplane landed safely about 35 minutes after departure.Mechanics found a bumble-bee had struck and embedded itsself into one of the pitot tubes of the airplane after takeoff, effectively blocking that dynamic port of the pitot system.A replacement Boeing 737-800 registration LN-RCY resumed the flight and reached Malaga with a delay of 3.5 hours.Insects had blocked the pitot system of a Birgenair Boeing 757-200 registration TC-GEN at Puerto Plata (Dominican Republic) while the airplane was parked at the airport for 25 days. The crew continued their takeoff of flight 301 to Frankfurt (Germany) on February 6th 1996 despite disagreeing airspeed indicators at the 80 knots call during takeoff and could not cope with the resulting simultaneous stall and overspeed warnings at around 7000 feet MSL.

A Comair/kulula.com Boeing 737-400, registration ZS-OAF performing flight MN-755 from Cape Town to Port Elizabeth (South Africa) with 143 passengers and 6 crew, struck its tail onto runway 19 during takeoff. The airplane got airborne and returned to Cape Town for a safe landing.The South African Civil Aviation Authority have released their final report concluding, that the probable cause was low speed during rotation as a result of incorrect Air Speed Indicator (ASI) settings by the crew. Contributing were interruptions in the electrical power supply by the ground power unit while the crew was busy with the pre-takeoff checks.When the crew was preparing for the flight, the ground power unit suddenly shut down causing interruptions in the electrical power supply. The airplane's auxiliary power unit (APU) was inoperative at the time.With the captain being pilot flying for the leg the aircraft taxied onto runway 19, flaps were set at 5 degrees for the takeoff. Takeoff thrust was set and achieved, but the airplane felt nose heavy and slower in response to elevator input. The aircraft was rotated according to the bugs set on the air speed indicator. While the airplane rotated, a bump was felt raising the suspicion that a tail strike had occured. The airplane lifted off, the gear was retracted, air traffic control advised of a possible tail strike, the cabin crew and passengers briefed and the cabin secured for landing. A runway inspection was performed by the airport and the airplane subsequently cleared for landing. The airplane landed safely using 30 degrees of flaps.The cockpit crew noted, that the bugs set on both of their ASIs were in agreement, however were set lower than computed on the takeoff card. The SACAA found, that the power interruptions distracted the crew during preflight preparations, so that they failed to take note of the discrepancy between the ASI bug settings and takeoff card writings. The discrepancy was noticed only after the tail strike.The airplane received no damage, the tail skid cartridge was found partially compressed.
F-GEXA after return to stand (Photo: Uwe Mund)An Air France Boeing 747-400, registration F-GEXA performing flight AF-443 from Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) to Paris Charles de Gaulle (France), rejected takeoff from Rio's runway 10 at high speed when a nose gear tyre ruptured causing strong vibrations to the airframe. The airplane stopped safely.The flight was initially postponed for 27 hours, then another Boeing 747-400 F-GISD performed the flight as AF-443A with a delay of 46 hours and reached Paris with a delay of 45 hours. F-GEXA reached Paris as the regular flight AF-443 departing Apr 20th on Tuesday (Apr 21st) with a delay of 48 hours.Air France reported, that the crew noticed severe vibrations at a speed of 70 knots and subsequently decided to reject takeoff. The problem was not a burst tyre problem as had been originally reported from Rio de Janeiro, but an anomaly with the landing gear selector. A team of technicians with the necessary parts was sent from Paris, however after replacing the defective part the technicians detected, that the vibrations had caused additional damage requiring additional spare parts to be shipped into the country. Getting those parts through customs caused additional successive postponement of the flight. The passengers were taken care of by Air France ground staff in Rio. Air France offer their apologies for the inconvenience caused by this long delay.Passenger Uwe Mund was travelling with his family in the upper deck and was supposed to take the flight one day earlier, but had accepted an offer by Air France to travel the next day as the original flight was overbooked. When the aircraft accelerated, he was looking out of the window and felt the takeoff pretty normal at first until the speed had reached around about 150-180 kph (80-100 knots, judged with his experience driving cars at those speed around German highways). Then the vibrations started so violently at a high frequency (multiple shocks per second), that various overhead panels like lights, loudspeakers and similiar came down. After the airplane came to a standstill, the captain made an announcement stating they had gear problems, the announcement (in English) was hard to understand as around half of the loudspeakers had come down and were inoperative. One of the loudspeakers (weight approx. 2 kg) had fallen down onto his son, who however managed to get out of the way.Uwe Mund said, that the Air France staff at Rio de Janeiro outdid themselves in handling the passengers and making sure, they received accomodation, food and were joined by their luggage. He was very satisfied with the treatment in Rio. However, he wasn't satisfied with the information policy. They weren't informed the next day that the departure had been postponed again, a simple flipchart in the lobby would have done that, and went to the airport to only be sent back to the hotel without explanation. Sunday's bus transfer from the hotels was scheduled for 11:00 am with a departure at 14:00 first, then set to 09:00am. The departure had to be delayed again when several passengers were missing obviously unaware of the time change. The airplane finally left at almost 16:00 local.Various overhead panels came down (Photos: Uwe Mund):

An Air Namibia Airbus A340-300, registration V5-NME performing flight SW-286 from Frankfurt/Main (Germany) to Windhoek (Namibia) with 265 passengers and 15 crew, returned to Frankfurt/Main after engine #4 (outer right) failed shortly after takeoff. The landing 20 minutes after takeoff was safe.The engine reportedly caught fire as result of the failure, the fire was extinguished with the engine fire bottles.Air Namibia told The Aviation Herald, that engine #4 (outer right) experienced a surge and compressor stalls just after rotation at Frankfurt, the engine flamed out visibly as result of the surge and stalls but did not catch fire, the engine fire suppression system (fire bottles) was not activated. The crew reduced the engine thrust to idle and kept the engine running until after safe landing in Frankfurt, where the airplane returned to. Air Namibia sees the engine failure related to a suspected bird strike on March 8th hitting the same engine, see also Incident: Air Namibia A343 at Windhoek on Mar 8th 2009, presumably bird strike.Air Namibia interrupted the rotation Windhoek to London Gatwick (SW-385 dep Mar 12th/SW-386 dep Mar 13th) in London the following day, cancelled the return leg SW-386 and SW-385 (both dep Mar 13th) back to London and ferried their second A340-300, V5-NMF over to Frankfurt (flight SW-9386), which resumed flight 286 and brought the passengers from Frankfurt to Windhoek with a total delay of 28 hours and returned to Frankfurt as regular (delayed) flight SW-285 from Windhoek to Frankfurt arriving on Mar 14th. Subsequently V5-NMF was ferried to London Gatwick as flight SW-9286 and resumed the London rotation (SW-386), while V5-NME resumed the Frankfurt rotation with flight SW-286 after the failed engine had been replaced.According to a statement released by Lufthansa Technics on April 1st, the incident engine had not been replaced, but underwent extensive verification and tests indicating optimal performance after replacement of some components, so that the incident engine was returned onto the aircraft. The engine however failed again on March 29th, see Incident: Air Namibia A343 near Frankfurt on Mar 29th 2009, engine fire alert.The Namibian "AZ Online" (Allgemeine Zeitung Namibias) remarked in their German comment (translation by The Aviation Herald): "Air Namibia has a problem compared to other airlines: With only two long haul aircraft it is difficult to provide a replacement aircraft in a hurry. A similiar breakdown can be compensated within a few hours at e.g. Lufthansa providing another aircraft. But in all fairness: so far Air Namibia has maintained a clean record. And the pilots returned Thursday evening to keep it that way, even if in theory it would have been possible to continue to Windhoek with the remaining three engines. But safety goes first, and that's good so. How big would the fury have been, had the aircraft continued and crashed? The now grumbling passengers should value their life and a safe flight more than a couple hours of wait."
An Indian Airlines Airbus A320-200, flight IC-401 from New Delhi to Kolkata (India) with 104 people on board, was lined up on Delhi's runway for takeoff and awaiting takeoff clearance, when a passenger alerted cabin crew of suspicious behaviour of fellow passengers.

The sweeper had been told to hold short of runway 09/27 and read back the instruction correctly, but did not comply with the instruction and entered the runway at a constant speed, monitoring the performance of the sweeper carefully as the sweeper had been shutting down intermittently. The driver was listening to the ground frequency, the airplane was on the mandatory frequency (MF). The Canadian TSB reported, that the incident took place in twilight about 15 minutes before the tower was manned. Data gathered from this investigation may be used in the investigation of a similiar event as well, The Aviation Herald reported: Incident: Sunwest B190 at Ft. McMurray on Feb 9th 2009, takeoff over snowplough.

The landing at LAX 11 minutes after takeoff was safe.A replacement Boeing 757-200 registration N7667A reached Chicago with a delay of 2 hours.A passenger on the flight wanting to remain unnamed reported: "About 5 seconds after take off the engine began making some loud banging noises and I looked over at my husband who had already turned white but of course said we would be fine and we can land on one engine. It was about 10 seconds later that the engine got quiet and then we continued flying and a couple of min later the captain came on and said we would be making an emergency landing at Los Angeles. Also, much longer runways and of course better connections (for once we cared about "small stuff" like getting home again). We did land about 10 min later to many emergency vehicles and fire trucks and then got checked out while they all drove around the plane to see what was going on and if we need to be sprayed down (I think). We sat on the plane awhile and they soon got us to a gate and found another airplane. I was impressed and kind of surprised that they had the crew turn around and fly us home. I thought maybe they would have them de-stress somewhere and maybe ask them about it. About 3 hours later we took off again (minus about maybe 10 passengers who figured it was not their day to fly!)." http://flightaware.com/live/flight/AAL1236/history/20090215/2321Z/KSNA/KORD

Uncontained engine failure (Photo: JTSB) A Skymark Airlines Boeing 767-300, registration JA767B performing flight BC-306 from Kagoshima to Tokyo Haneda (Japan) with 79 passengers and 11 crew, was just rotating for takeoff, when the right engine experienced severe vibrations, 3 minutes later the fire alert activated. The crew shut the engine down and returned to Kagoshima for a safe landing, no injuries were reported, the engine however set the grass besides the runway alight.The Japan Transportation Safety Board released their final report (in Japanese) into the serious incident, concluding:that a high pressure turbine blade of the right hand engine had developed a crack due to metal fatigure caused by non-volcanic sulfur attached to the blade and broke off. Due to the resulting vibration due to imbalance of the turbine ring the 6th fuel feed pipe ruptured and thus increased the fuel pressure and temperatures in the combustion chamber and following hot sections. The resulting pressure, vibrations and temperatures caused the engine core to melt down with all turbine blades hitting the housing and breaking off. The engine housing could not withstand the forces by increased fuel pressure, temperatures and the blades hitting the side walls. The fire detection sensors were not fast enough due to molten core.The airplane, equipped with General Electric CF6-80C2, had just started to rotate for takeoff with N2 (rpm of both engines) at 100%, the air/ground sensor had just gone into air mode, when the vibration for the right hand engine increased to 2.82 units, an EGT of 926 degrees (permitted 960) was indicated. The copilot, pilot flying, noticed some strange sound. 2 seconds later the right hand vibrations increased to 4.99 units, the right hand fuel flow reduced. The captain took control ("I have control", "you have control") and commanded gear up further 2 seconds later. 14 seconds after liftoff the commander orders the first officer to execute the engine failure checklist. 24 seconds after liftoff the right hand engine fuel flow had about halved compared to the left hand engine. The aircraft was handed off to the departure controller, where the captain reported the problem with the right engine and entered the departure procedures for engine failure. The engine is throttled back to idle and stablizes at values around normal idle parameters, the vibration ceases. As the engine remains stable for 20 seconds, the captain attempts to increase power again while the airplane climbs through about 3500 feet, which results in severe vibration again. The throttle is pulled back to idle again. A low right oil pressure warning comes up. 3 minutes after liftoff the fire bell starts, master caution illuminates and right engine fire is indicated on the EICAS. The engine is being shut down while the airplane reaches 6000 feet. The crew now declares emergency and returns to Kagoshima, where the airplane lands safely 19 minutes after liftoff.

An Expressjet Airlines Embraer ERJ-145, flight XE-152 from Louisville,KY to Tampa,FL (USA) carrying the Louisville Cardinals Mens Basketball Team consisting of 41 people, had to return to Louisville shortly after takeoff, when a fire detector alerted the cockpit crew of a possible fire on board. The landing about 10 minutes after liftoff was safe, the crew taxied to the apron after a check by fire services on the runway and had the team disembark normally.The fire alert was determined to be false.A replacement Embraer 145 registration N12569 resumed the flight and delivered the team to their Wednesday (Jan 7th) game against South Florida with a delay of 5 hours.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/BTA152/history/20090106/2110Z/KSDF/KTPAhttp://flightaware.com/live/flight/BTA152/history/20090107/0110Z/KSDF/KTPA
An Air France Airbus A321-200, registration F-GTAJ performing flight AF-2585 from Tunis (Tunisia) to Paris Charles de Gaulle (France) with 209 people on board, returned to Tunis due to an unspecified engine problem. The landing 14 minuter after takeoff was safe.A passenger reported, that he saw one of the engines emit smoke, others reported a flash and a loud bang.The flight was cancelled, the passengers were brought to hotels.Following the emergency directive 2008-228 by the European Aviation Safety Agency The Aviation Herald followed up with Air France and was told, that only one surge of the left engine (#1) was identified by the flight crew on their instruments, even though passengers heard loud bangs from both engines. Neither engine was shut down and the airplane returned for a safe landing on both engines. The Tunisian Safety Board came to the conclusion, that only one surge occured on the left hand engine. Engine #1 was replaced in Tunis. Air France wrote: "All Air France A318/319/320/321 with the CFM56-5B engines installed comply with the EASA AD."Air France also said, that since April 2008 three operators had reported stalling incidents with CFM56-5B engines equipped with 5BQ software. However, "The TUN event may have brought this subject into the spotlight."
A British Gulf International Antonov AN-12 freighter, freight flight from Sharjah (United Arab Emirates) to Afghanistan with 6 crew, veered off the runway at Sharjah while attempting takeoff.

The crew of an Air Canada Jazz Canadair CRJ-200, flight QK-7077 from Yellowknife,NT to Calgary,AB (Canada), reported flaps trouble shortly after takeoff from Yellowknife and returned for a safe landing on runway 15.The flight reached Calgary with a delay of 9 hours.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/JZA7077/history/20081231/1610Z/CYZF/CYYC
The crew of an Egypt Air Express Embraer ERJ-170, registration SU-GCU performing flight MS-363 from Sharm el Sheikh to Luxor (Egypt) with 62 people on board, reported nose gear trouble after takeoff from Sharm el Sheikh and decided to divert to Cairo International Airport. The crew performed two low approaches along runway 23R to have the gear inspected. Subsequently the airplane landed safely on runway 23R with just one nose wheel, while the second nose wheel was missing.The missing nose wheel was found on the extended center line of the departure runway well past the runway end at Sharm el Sheikh.
A Kuwait Airways Airbus A300-600, registration 9K-AMB performing flight KU-542 from Cairo (Egypt) to Kuwait (Kuwait) with 227 passengers, returned to Cairo after the right hand engine failed shortly after takeoff. The landing on runway 05R about 30 minutes after takeoff was safe, the passengers disembarked normally.The airplane had departed about one hour late due to maintenance necessary to the right hand engine of the airplane. Kuwait Airways reported, that the left hand engine had failed shortly after takeoff. A replacement Airbus A300-600, registration 9K-AMD, was sent to Cairo to resume the flight.Sources at the airport of Cairo had reported, that the right hand engine caught fire enroute prompting the airplane to return.A passenger reported via a friend's blog, that the right hand engine exploded jolting the airplane about 20 seconds after takeoff. Another explosion followed again jolting the aircraft, then a third final explosion shook the airplane hard. The airplane started losing altitude, fellow passengers in the back of the airplane started screaming, that there was fire out of the engine. The passenger could see smoke and flames coming out of the engine himself, too. The airplane was brought under control and the crew performing a safe landing about 30 minutes after the engine explosion.
The crew of a Skywest Airlines Canadair CRJ-200, registration N417SW performing flight OO-6562 from Winnipeg,MB (Canada) to Denver,CO (USA), declared emergency shortly after takeoff and reported, that the flaps did not respond despite being selected. The aircraft landed safely about 20 minutes later.The flight was cancelled.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/SKW6562/history/20081213/2009Z/CYWG/KDEN
An Air India Airbus A320-200 on behalf of Indian Airlines, flight IC-263 from Kolkata to New Delhi (India) with 72 passengers, returned to Kolkata about 15 minutes after takeoff due to an unspecified technical problem.

The crew of a Mesaba Airlines Saab 340B on behalf of Pen Air, registration N364PX performing flight KS-221/AS-3221 from Anchorage,AK to Aniak,AK (USA) with 6 passengers and 3 crew, rejected takeoff from Anchorage's runway 07R after a loud pop was heard from the left engine and the over-temperature light illuminated momentarily in the cockpit. The airplane came to a safe stop, no injuries occured.The NTSB have released their factual report suggesting, that blade-damper binding issues caused one stage #1 rotor blade of the gas generator to separate due to high cycle fatigue. The blade was contained within the engine, the resulting damages were limited to the interior of the engine.The NTSB states, that the damper binding issue has been tracked since 2001 already and was addressed by service bulletin SB 72-0475. The SB introduces blade dampers not suspectible to binding. About 95% of the fleet complied with the service bulletin. The engine manufacturer recommends to those operator, who have not complied with the SB, to reduce their boroscope inspection intervals from 800 to 400 flight hours. The Mesaba aircraft did not comply with the service bulletin.http://www.ntsb.gov/ntsb/brief2.asp?ev_id=20080812X01218&ntsbno=ANC08IA092&akey=1
F-GMPG the following day (Photo: BEA) A Regional Compagnie Aerienne Europeenne Fokker 100 on behalf of Air France, registration F-GMPG performing flight AF-7775 from Pau to Paris Charles de Gaulle (France) with 50 passengers and 4 crew, could not sustain flight during takeoff from runway 13, overran the runway hitting a lorry killing the driver and came to a stop 535 meters (1754 feet) past the runway end. No injuries occured on board of the aircraft.The French Bureau dEnquetes et dAnalyses (BEA) have published their final report concluding, that ice contaminated the upper surfaces of the wings causing seriously degraded aerodynamics. Contributing factor was the fast rotation by the pilots as reaction to presence of birds.The aircraft left the apron stand at 10:15 UTC. The commander (44) was pilot flying, the copilot (37)was monitoring pilot. The aircraft had arrived at 09:37 UTC from Paris Charles de Gaule with the same crew. At 10:23 UTC, the aircraft arrived at the holding point of runway 13. 2 minutes later, the crew were cleared to enter and backtrack the runway, and at 10:25 UTC, were cleared for take off. The commander subsequently set TOGA, which was confirmed by the copilot. Some birds were noted by the crew during the take off roll. At 10:26:03 UTC, the copilot announced "V1, VR I say" at 128 kt IAS. At 10:26:08, the aircraft was airborne with a speed of 144 kts IAS and a pitch angle of 15°, the pitch rate exceeded 6 degrees/second. Immediately afterwards, the aircraft banked sharply to the left. Bank angle reached 35° and the alarm "Bank Angle" was heard. The commander countered the bank by turning the steering wheel to the right. The aircraft banked right and started to descend. The maximum bank angle reached 67°. The crew countered the movement again, the aircraft banked left again to 59°. The GPWS "Dont Sink" alarm started. The maximum radio altitude was 107 ft. At 10:26:22 the right main gear made contact with the ground right of the runway. The speed was 160 kts. At this moment, the commander decided to reduced the engine power to idle. The aircraft was thrown in the air again, the speed between 160 and 165 kts. It touched down a second time at 10:26:27 on a road in the extended centreline of runway 13 with 163 kts. At 10:26:29, the thrust reversers were deployed for about 3 seconds. The aircraft rolled on for about 340 meters before crossing a road near the airport and colliding with a truck, killing the driver. The main gear then smashed into an embankment next to the road and was torn off. At 10:26:40, the copilot announced the failure of the right engine. The aircraft continued on a field and stopped after around 535 meters at 10:26:49. The copilot transmitted a Mayday message to the tower. At 10:27:06, the commander ordered the shut down of the aircraft, and at 10:27:42, he ordered the evacuation. All passengers and crew members left the aircraft without injury. The aircraft was written off as a result of the huge damage. The crew of the aircraft was well experienced with about 6000 hours flight time each, of which the commander had spent almost 3000 hours on the F100, the copilot however had only 287 hours on type. The aircraft had entered service in 1991 and had completed 28586 flight hours with 34886 cycles. The investigation found no technical problems with the aircraft. The weight and balance was well within limits, the aircraft weighing 38450 kg at take off, with an MAC of 21%. The power setting was defined as TOGA, flaps set at 8° and anti icing for both engines and airframe on. The aircraft was not de-iced before departure. The speeds were calculated as V1 at 123 kt, VR at 127 kt and V2 at 132 kt. The weather at Pau at the time of the accident was with winds out of the northeast with 10 kts, light snow, clouds at 1100 and 3000 ft a temperature of M00/M01. The investigators found that the aircraft had crossed a highly saturated zone of humidity at around 10000 ft with a temperature of -12° C. Even though the conditions were such that de-icing was a real issue, only one aircraft had required such before the accident, a A320. Neither the crew of the accident flight, nor those of an A319, a ERJ 135 and a military CASA 235 had requested or received de-icing. The aircraft was found severely damaged, with both main gears torn off, the engine casings damaged and numerous damages on the fuselage. It was considered beyond repair and written off. The evacuation was conducted in a timely and orderly manner, resulting in few injuries. The passengers and crew left the aircraft via the front doors and one overwing exit. Passengers praised the crew after the flight for the calm and orderly way the evacuation was conducted. The commander and 9 passengers were checked at a hospital but released shortly after. The investigation soon started to consider other accidents on the type and on other types under similar conditions. The Fokker 28 and 100 had several occurrences before, resulting in accidents, the most prominent being at Dryden and La Guardia (F28) and Skopje (F100). In all the accidents, the not de iced Fokker 28 or 100 planes had failed to climb after take off with similar bank angle oscillations experienced by the accident flight. The most similar accident being the one of a Palair Fokker 100, registration PH-KXL, which crashed after take off from Skopje in almost identical conditions. After that accident, several safety recommendations were issued amongst which one prescribing de-icing as compulsory whenever equal conditions exist. Several other recommendations were not included in the final report of that accident. The BEA reached the following conclusion: The reason for the accident was the loss of control of the aircraft caused by the presence of contamination on the wings. The crew did not consider the meteorological situation sufficiently. Additionally, they rotated the aircraft very fast as a reflex reaction to the presence of birds. Contributing to the accident was the lack of understanding of the risks of ice in the French aviation community, lack of sensibility about the particularities of aircraft without slats to the effect of icing and insufficient sensibilisation of flight crews to the methods of detection and verification of the presence of ice. The BEA issued several safety recommendations after this accident, to the effect of increased vigilance for the necessity of de-icing in such conditions. It has to be stressed again, that particularly the Fokker 28 / 100 series need severe attention with regards of de-icing procedures.The full final report (in French) is available at: http://www.bea-fr.org/docspa/2007/f-pg070125/pdf/f-pg070125.pdf
A Skywest Airlines Canadair CRJ-200, flight OO-2716 from Milwaukee,WI to Flint,MI (USA) with 40 passengers, returned to Milwaukee after the crew reported smoke in the cockpit.

A Gulf Air Airbus A321-200, registration A9C-ES performing flight GF65 from Mumbai (India) to Bahrain (Bahrain) with 124 passengers and 9 crew, was lined up on the departure runway waiting for takeoff, when the left engine caught fire. The crew initiated an immediate evacuation via slides. Fire services were able to quickly contain and extinguish the fire.Mumbai's main runway was closed for 45 minutes until the airplane could be towed off the runway. Several arriving flights had to divert as a result.The flight was cancelled and the passengers were brought to hotels.
A Skymark Boeing 767-300, registration JA767F performing flight BC-730 from Sapporo to Tokyo Haneda (Japan) with 150 passengers and 8 crew, was cleared for takeoff, but rejected takeoff at 88 KIAS after the crew spotted a crossing traffic near the far end of takeoff runway 19R of Sapporo's New Chitose Airport in good visibility.An All Nippon Airways Boeing 777-200, registration JA8967 performing flight NH-79 from Tokyo Haneda to Sapporo (Japan) with 235 passengers and 11 crew, had just landed on runway 19L, got cleared to cross runway 19R and then contact ground by the tower controller and thus continued to cross runway 19R, forcing the Skymark crew to reject their takeoff.The Skymark 767 came to a stop 1400 meters short of the ANA 777, then needed 3 minutes to check their brakes before the airplane continued to taxi off the runway at the next exit and returned to the ramp.The Japanese Transportation Safety Board reported, that the Skymark 767 had received takeoff clearance and was about 500 meters into the takeoff run, having reached 88 KIAS at that point, when the crew spotted the 777 crossing their runway and rejected takeoff. The airplane reached a maximum speed of 95 KIAS and came to a full stop about 600 meters after the decision to reject takeoff. The 767 was 1400 meters short of the crossing 777 at that point.The tower controller cleared the ANA Boeing 777 to cross runway 19R on his own about 50 seconds after issuing the takeoff clearance for the Skymark Boeing 767. Originally he had intended to delay the 767 takeoff clearance until the 777 had crossed the runway and thought, his previous radio communication was informing the 767 crew of that intended sequence.The tower controller had been working his consecutive 4th day of a 6 day rotational pattern, which had the controller working the morning shift from 7:30-12:00 and the swing shift from 16:30-21:30 (the previous day he had worked the afternoon shift from 11:30 to 17:00). The incident occured around 21:09 local time.The JTSB concluded, that the probable cause of the serious incident was the controller's erroneous takeoff clearance while he was just planning to release that clearance after the 777 had crossed the runway and remained unaware of the fact, that he had cleared the takeoff. The controller issued the erroneous takeoff clearance and did not grasp the resulting situation due to fatigue.The full report in Japanese (including mostly English transcripts of communication) is available at: http://araic.assistmicro.co.jp/jtsb/aircraft/download/pdf2/AI08-01-2-JA767F-JA8967.pdfOverview of the incident (Graphics by JTSB):
The crew of a Skywest Airlines Canadair CRJ-200, flight OO-6730 from Winnipeg,MB (Canada) to Denver,CO (USA), reported flaps trouble shortly after takeoff. The airplane returned to Winnipeg. Although no assistance was requested, the tower called the emergency services out. The aircraft landed safely 30 minutes later.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/SKW6730/history/20081219/1404Z/CYWG/KDEN
The crew of an Air North Boeing 737-200, registration C-FJLB performing flight 4N-505 from Whitehorse,YT to Vancouver,BC (Canada), rejected takeoff at about 110 knots after a loud bang was heard from engine #2 and the airplane started to yaw to the right. The crew throttled both engines back and brought the airplane down to taxi speed. The aircraft taxied back to the ramp, where the crew shut down both engines and passengers disembarked.Passengers had observed flames out of the engine inlet and exhaust pipe at the time of the bang. A first visual inspection revealed a rubber seal hanging off compressor 2 inlet guide vane. No problems could be seen on compressors 1, 3 and 4. It is not clear, whether the rubber seal on C2 contributed to the engine surge. No evidence of foreign object damage was found. A boroscopic inspection has been ordered from an external vendor, but will take months to complete. The engine has been dismounted and taken out of service. The engine performance is being monitored by an external contractor, no concerns had been discovered before the surge. The engine however had shown similiar behaviour immediately after its installation in April 2007.A replacement Boeing 737-200 performed the flight with a delay of 4.5 hours.
An Aeroflot Airbus A320-200, registration VP-BWF performing flight SU-716 from Barnaul to Moscow Sheremetyevo (Russia) with 90 passengers and 7 crew, was just about to start the takeoff roll, when one of the cockpit windows developed a crack. The flight was cancelled and the passengers rebooked for the next day's flight.

The crew of an American Airlines MD-82, flight AA-1683 from Minneapolis,MN to Dallas Ft. Worth,TX (USA) with 117 passengers and 5 crew, declared emergency reporting a fire on board about 4 minutes after takeoff from runway 17. The airplane returned to Minneapolis runway 12R and landed safely 10 minutes after takeoff.Passengers reported, that they heard a loud bang from below, then blue smoke started to emanate from the cabin floor.American Airlines reported, that duct work had failed or blown a hole, triggering a smoke detector in the cargo area, which in turn activated a fire retardant system. There was no fire however.The passengers were rebooked onto other flights.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/AAL1683/history/20081212/1713Z/KMSP/KDFW

The landing 12 minutes after takeoff was safe. No injuries have been reported. Fire services did not find any trace of fire, but had to remove the smoke from the cockpit. The cause of the smoke has not yet been determined.http://flightaware.com/live/flight/SKW5442/history/20081204/0117Z/KPSP/KLAX
Cockpit of F-OIQI (Photo: BEA) An Air Moorea de Havilland DHC6-300 Twin Otter, registration F-OIQI performing 7 minute flight QE1121 from Termae on Mo'orea to Papetee (Tahiti) with 19 passengers and one pilot, lost height and impacted a lagoon about 1 minute after takeoff from Mo'orea. The BEA concluded, that the crash was caused by rupture of the elevator cable as the result of wear, an external force most likely being a jet blast, and applied normal pilot input during retraction of the flaps.The French Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses (BEA) have released the final report into the crash reporting, that the flight was conducted under visual flight rules (VFR) at a scheduled altitude of 2000 feet. The flight would have lasted about 7 minutes. After a normal takeoff preparation the airplane positioned on the runway for takeoff and got cleared for takeoff about 2 minutes later. The pilot advanced throttles, 52 seconds later the pilot retracts the flaps, further 9 seconds later he reduces the power. 2 more seconds later the pilot utters an exclamation of surprise, two GPWS alerts sound, the power setting is increased again, 4 more GPWS alarms sound. 11 seconds after the exclamation the airplane impacts the waters. Between advancing throttles for takeoff and impact with water were 1 minute and 8 seconds.During investigation it was found, that the elevator cable connecting the yoke with the moving elevator control surfaces had broken in two locations, one close to the yoke and another rupture close to the elevators. Analysis found, that although the cable showed traces of chafing and wear (which were not noticed during initial visual inspection by BEA), the rupture could not have occured without additional beforehand weakening of the cable by an extreme force exceeding the possibilities of pilot input or regular operating conditions. The BEA computes, that an Airbus A340, departing the stand at Papeete with F-OIQI being parked overnight about 80 meters away from the A340 produced a sufficient impulse to cause the breakage of several strands of the cable. After the cable was weakened that way, the remaining strands wore further down through normal flight load and finally broke suddenly during the regular control forces necessary during retraction of the flaps.F-OIQI was the only airplane within the fleet of Air Moorea equipped with stainless steel elevator cables, while the other aircraft were equipped with carbon steel elevator cables. The two types of cables are interchangeable and have the same maintenance intervals and activities. The operator did not know however, that the carbon cables are more suspectible to corrosion, while the stainless steel cables are suspectible of wear. The maintenance interval is based on calendar intervals and does not take the activity of the airplane into account. Many operators had therefore reduced inspection intervals on their own. The BEA concluded, that the most probable cause of the crash was:the loss of pitch control after the elevator cable broke during retraction of the flapsThe failure was caused by the sequence of following events:- significant wear of the cable at a rope pulley - external phenomenon, probably jet blast, causing the breakage of several strands - failure of the last strands as a result of regular flight control forcesContributing factors have been:- the lack of information about and training of a loss of pitch control provided to pilots- omission of special inspections by the operator- inadequate consideration of wear by manufacturer and the authority granting airworthiness- inadequate consideration of risks of jet blast by airworthiness authorities and airport operators- the rules to replace the stainless steel cables based on a calendar without considering the activity of the aircraft in terms of type of operation.Six safety recommendations were made as the result of the investigation.The full BEA report in French is available at: http://www.bea-fr.org/docspa/2007/f-qi070809/pdf/f-qi070809.pdfRuptured elevator cable (Photo: BEA):

An Aeroflot Airbus A320-200, flight SU780 from Krasnojarsk to Moscow Sheremetyevo (Russia) with reportedly 200 (??) passengers, was evacuated while deicing for takeoff was in progress. A passenger looking out of his window saw white clouds of smoke, thought the plane was on fire, panicked and thus created panic with the other passengers, too. The crew decided to give way to the resulting stampede, alerted the tower and initiated the evacuation. The white smoke clouds were in fact steam from the deicing fluid. Aeroflot said the following day, that the air conditioning of the airplane should have been turned off during the de-icing procedure, but was running. Some de-icing fluid entered the vents and evaporated, producing some haze in the cabin, which obviously helped the panic.

A passenger on board, who wants to remain unnamed, reported on Monday (Nov 3rd), that the airplane was sitting at the gate unusually long after doors were closed, then the airplane was pushed back, pulled in, and pushed back again a couple of times. Then the engines were started and the airplane taxied towards the runway. Immediately before the runway a deicing truck was waiting for the airplane, the airplane stopped. Shortly thereafter white clouds like smoke, steam or fog appeared inside the cabin from the back crawling just under the cabin ceiling and quickly filled the entire cabin. No smell was noticeable, definitely no smell like smoke, deicing fluid, alcohol or steam. While the haze distributed throughout the cabin, people were still quietly sitting buckled into their seats. Then a loud command was shouted from the back, prompting all passengers to unbuckle and raise from their seats, both doors in the back were opened, slides deployed to both right and left of the aircraft and the evacuation started. The overwing exits were opened by the according passengers, too.While passengers were jumping down the slides, a S7 aircraft taxied along the Airbus and began its takeoff roll.Fire engines arrived after a few minutes but didn't really jump to action. Some long time later 2 busses arrived and took the passengers to the airport terminal, where passengers had to pick up their luggage and send through screening again. Several passengers decided to not continue their journey and returned to Krasnojarsk.Rumour amongst the passengers while waiting for the replacement aircraft in the departure lounge had it, that there was a fire in the rear galley. The source of the rumour however is unknown.

A South African Airways Boeing 737-800, flight SA309 from Johannesburg to Cape Town (South Africa), was evacuated shortly before takeoff, when dense smoke appeared in the rear of the airplane. No injuries have been reported.A replacement aircraft took off about 2.5 hours later.
A bmi British Midland Airbus A319-100, registration G-DBCI performing flight BD104 from Amsterdam (Netherland) to London Heathrow, EN (UK) with 112 passengers and 5 crew, veered rapidly to the right during the takeoff run on runway 36L, chnaging direction by about 20 degrees and prompting the commander, pilot not flying, to assume an engine failure. Although below V1 (highest speed at which takeoff could be safely rejected) the takeoff was continued, as the commander did not call "STOP" as required by bmi's standard operating procedures. The commander instead called "engine failure" as the airplane rotated. As the airplane approached the right edge of the runway the first officer, pilot flying, rotated the airplane and lifted off about 5 knots below V1 and Vr, which had both been computed to be 143 knots. The copilot steered the airplane back onto the extended runway center line.The crew of another aircraft departing next after G-DBCI observed the takeoff and reported skidmarks on the runway. A runway inspection was immediately carried out and confirmed skidmarks, leading to the conclusion that G-DBCI's right main gear may have blocked. In the meantime the crew of G-DBCI realized, that both engines were operating normally and within all parameters. The crew therefore discussed, whether the copilot may have done an inadvertent rudder input. The commander had his feet lightly on the rudder pedals during the takeoff to have a feel of what was going on and had noticed only light pedal activity. The copilot was firm, that he did not create a pedal input which could have swung the airplane around. The crew concluded, that it must have been "atmospheric forces", which caused the right swing.The news about the "blocked" right main gear were relayed to the crew via Air Traffic Control towards the end of the flight. The crew understood, that the gear had been "locked", assuming, the wheels did not rotate. Although the crew had no indication to confirm this information and the cabin crew had not noticed anything abnormal except for the right swing during takeoff, the crew was concerned that one or more tyres might have been damaged during takeoff, declared emergency and requested equipment to stand by for the landing. The landing was performed without autobrakes, with idle reverse and gentle braking on the left hand gear. The landing was safe.Emergency Services observing the landing did not notice anything abnormal. The airplane taxied slowly to the gate, passengers disembarked normally.Winds during departure had been varying between 325 and 005 degrees with speeds from 4 to 8 knots. A second anenometer measured winds between 285 and 330 degrees and 7.5 to 9.5 knots.The AAIB, to which the Dutch Aviation Authority had delegated the investigation, found no abnormalities with the rudder system, the flight data recorder however showed a pronounced rudder deflection to the right starting at a speed of 116 knots. The input returned to neutral over the next two second, then another right pedal movement up to 72% of maximum deflection was recorded at a speed of 128 knots. The copilot's sidestick showed the begin of the takeoff roation at that point, the commander's sidestick registering a full left hand roll input, the copilot's sidestick also starting to move towards a full left roll. Half a second later one sample of reduced rudder and aileron input was recorded, followed by a full 31 degrees right yaw command, effectively a 30 degrees rudder deflection to the right and an opposing 5 degrees left yaw command by the yaw damper. The rudder reached 24 degrees of right deflection as a result. At an indicated airspeed of 130 knots, with full left ailerons, the aircraft started to rotate and went through 2 degrees nose up, yawing through 015 degrees. Over the next 3.5 seconds the rudder inputs and roll inputs returned to neutral and the heading stabilized at 022 degrees. With a stable 14 degrees nose up attitude, a speed of 138 knots and a right roll of about 3 degrees the airplane left ground before the right main gear went over the right runway edge. The airplane reached V1 at 470 feet AGL and reached V2 at 750 feet AGL.The remainder of the flight appeared uneventful.The reason for the right rudder input and deviation from center line could not be determined, the AAIB concluded, however it was considered that distraction and under-arousal of the flight crew in benign conditions were possible factors. The application of full right rudder pedal may have been an alarmed response during the sequence of events, before the aircraft lifted off.Two safety recommendations were made as the result of this incident.The full AAIB report is available at http://www.aaib.dft.gov.uk/cms_resources/Airbus%20A319-131,%20G-DBCI%2008-08.pdf
The commander of a Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747-400, registration G-VHOT performing flight VS45 from London Heathrow,EN (UK) to New York JFK,NY (USA) with 386 passengers and 20 crew, decided to continue the takeoff from London Heathrow, when the stick shaker started to operate approximately 5 knots below V1. The commander concluded, that this was not a genuine indication of the airplane reaching a critical attitude.With the copilot now flying the airplane and doing radio communications, the commander concentrated on troubleshooting the probem with maintenance staff on the ground. The circuit breakers for both stick shakers were pulled in that process, stopping the stick shaker activity. The pilots now considered whether to continue to New York, when the crew noticed an ALT DISAGREE message on their EICAS (Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System). The altitude at the copilot's instruments read FL170, while the commander had FL167 on his instruments. Soon after the ALT DISAGREE message an IAS DISAGREE message came up. The crew decided to return to London Heathrow, dumped fuel, worked the various checklists and decided to link both instrument sets (for copilot and commander) to the left Air Data Computer (ADC). The airplane landed safely about 71 minutes after departure.Maintenance staff, although being aware of the stick shaker incident, concentrated on the computer printouts regarding the disagreeing data of both ADCs. The right hand Air Data Computer was replaced and the airplane returned to service.The commander, in agreement with the copilot, decided, that they were fit and able to fly despite extending their duty time. The airplane therefore taxied to the runway, the second takeoff run on runway 27R commenced exactly 3 hours after the first takeoff. The stick shakers activated again about 5 knots below V1, this time the commander decided to reject takeoff and came to a safe stop about two thirds down the runway. The crew elected to taxi to a gate position, as brakes temperatures remained acceptable. The flight was cancelled.Maintenance now exposed the airplane to a "simulated flight", a pitot test set was connected to both pitot heads, and an air pressure approximating 140 knots applied to both pitot tubes. No fault was found with the left system, however during test of the right hand system the stick shaker activated even with the Angle of Attack (AoA) sensor in its horizontal position. The right hand AoA sensor was replaced with satisfactory results. The airplane was returned to service with no further incidents.The right AoA sensor was sent to the manufacturer for further analysis under supervision of the NTSB. Tests, during which the sensor should produce certain electrical outputs through the range of movement, failed. The electrical output was random in its nature. A disassembly of the device revealed, that the main drive gear had become loose and was rotating freely 360 degrees around the main shaft.The right hand ADC was also subjected to a test by the manufacturer, where no hard faults were found, the device passed all tests.It was determined, that the altitude and speed disagree messages were the result of both ADCs assuming different angles of attack and thus applying different computations to compensate for pressure differences at high angles of attack.The full report is available at http://www.aaib.dft.gov.uk/cms_resources/Boeing%20747-4Q8,%20G-VHOT%2008-08.pdf
A Gol Transportes Aereos Boeing 737-700, flight G3-1777 from Ilheus,BA to Sao Paulo Guarulhos,SP (Brazil) with 92 passengers and 6 crew, struck a vulture with one of the engines shortly after takeoff. The resulting engine failure forced the crew to return to Ilheus, where the airplane landed safely 20 minutes after takeoff.The passengers were rebooked onto two subsequent flights.Infraero, the Brasilian Airport Authority reported, that about 30 vultures and other birds were seen in the vicinity of the airport at the time of the incident. The incident will be reviewed by the "Centro de Investigação e Prevenção de Acidentes" (Cenipa), the Brasilian Accident Investigation Center.
The FAA reported, that an American Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-82, registration N557AN, blew one of the left main gear tyres on takeoff from Dallas Forth Worth on Thursday, August 7th 21:32Z. Pieces of the burst tyre struck against the underside of the wing pentrating the wing and creating a hole of 30cm by 10 cm (12 inches by 4 inches) on the underside of the wing.The FAA did not identify the flight or provide any further details despite repeated requests by The Aviation Herald. American Airlines bluntly refused to comment telling The Aviation Herald after repeated phone calls: "You will not receive a return call."Have you been departing Dallas Forth Worth on August 7th on a flight with some abnormalities (e.g. emergency services standing by on arrival)? Have you witnessed or do you know some more details about the incident on takeoff from DFW? Have you listened to the ATC frequencies of DFW and noticed anything unusual on August 7th? Please tell us your observations via our Contact Form.N557AN had performed flight AA707 from New York La Guardia,NY to Dallas Fort Worth,TX and further on to Phoenix,AZ, departing Dallas DFW for Phoenix at 11:30am CDT (16:30Z), arriving in Phoenix at 11:30am MST (18:30Z). The next flight back to DFW would have been AA1760 (airplane unidentifyable), which departed 12:20pm MST (19:20Z) and arrived into DFW at 4:50pm CDT (21:50Z). It appears therefore impossible, that the airplane reported by the FAA, N557AN, was in DFW at the reported time. The FAA chose to not repond to an according query for clarification by The Aviation Herald as well.On July 25th 2000 Air France Flight 4590, a Concorde, took off Paris Charles de Gaulle. During the takeoff run a left hand main gear tyre ruptured, the pieces of which penetrated the left wing creating a leak in the wing fuel tank. The fuel ignited, engines #1 and #2 surged, and the airplane crashed into a hotel in Gonesse.The FAA preliminary report is (currently) available at: http://www.faa.gov/data_statistics/accident_incident/preliminary_data/media/D_0808_N.txtand reads: ******************************************************************************** ** Report created 8/11/2008 Record 1 ** ********************************************************************************IDENTIFICATION Regis#: 557AN Make/Model: MD80 Description: MD-81/82/83/87/88 Date: 08/07/2008 Time: 2132 Event Type: Incident Highest Injury: None Mid Air: N Missing: N Damage: UnknownLOCATION City: FORT WORTH State: TX Country: USDESCRIPTION AIRCRAFT HAD A BLOWN LEFT MAIN TIRE WITH A 12 INCH BY 4 INCH HOLE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE WING, FORT WORTH, TXINJURY DATA Total Fatal: 0 # Crew: 0 Fat: 0 Ser: 0 Min: 0 Unk: # Pass: 0 Fat: 0 Ser: 0 Min: 0 Unk: # Grnd: Fat: 0 Ser: 0 Min: 0 Unk: OTHER DATA Activity: Business Phase: Take-off Operation: Air Carrier FAA FSDO: FORT WORTH, TX (SW19) Entry date: 08/08/2008

A Pinnacle Canadair CRJ-900, flight 9E-2024 from Memphis, TN to Atlanta, GA (USA) with 56 passengers, returned to Memphis shortly after takeoff, when smoke was seen coming off the airplane's engines.An inspection of the freshly washed airplane after landing revealed, that left over washing solution had caused emission of mist out of both engines. The crew thought, it was smoke.The airplane took off again arriving at Atlanta with a delay of more than 5 hours.
The crew and passengers of a Qantas Boeing 747-400, registration VH-OJM performing flight QF149 from Sydney (Australia) to Los Angeles, CA (USA), heard loud bangs and felt vibrations through the airframe as the airplane climbed through 4000 feet after takeoff from Sydney. An increase of the exhaust gas temperatures were then observed for engine number 3, upon which the crew performed the engine non-normal checklist, shut the engine down and returned to Sydney.The Australien Transportation Safety Board (ATSB) found in their investigation, that the engine had sustained "a high pressure compressor (HPC), stage 1, blade failure" at its root. After the blade broke free, it caused subsequent considerable damage to the engine's high pressure module.The engine, Rolls Royce RB211-524G2-T serial number 13184, had completed 21,032 hours and 2,359 cycles since its last refurbishment.The ATSB reports further, that there had been a total of 16 HPC stage 1 root failures since 2001 with the blades released and two more blade cracks. Five of these failures occured at Qantas, the others with one other operator. Although this limited the damages to just two operators, they represent 49% of all engines of that type operated worldwide.Inspection there revealed, that 7 of their failures had occured in freight flights. The ATSB found another such incident of a HPC stage 1 blade root failure with a different engine using the same blades however at this other operator.Rolls Royce was aware of the failures and had concluded, that those failures were produced by complex vibrations induced by asymmetric blade tip rubbing around the HPC stage 1 rotor path. The manufacturer believed, that asymmetric rubbing was caused by a distortion of the HP case associated with high casing loads, which have not been identified.The manufacturer therefore introduced a service bulletin, that should reduce the case distortion and high structural loads.Both operators adopted the bulletin in their maintenance work starting February 2006, Qantas had already done that work on 48% of their engines by February 2007, projecting completion of the work by 2010.Both operators have not yet experienced the failure of an engine after the modifications were done according to Roll Royce's service bulletin.The ATSB therefore concludes: "As the precursors to the HPC case distortion and resulting blade tip rub are not yet fully understood, prevention of that failure cannot be assured."The full report by ATSB can be found at:http://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/investigation_reports/2007/AAIR/pdf/aair200700356_001.pdf

After a report of an rejected takeoff by an Embraer 145, when the airplane would not rotate, FAA mandates, that earlier Airworthiness directives have to be accelerated and the swap of mechanical gust locks on ERJ-135 and ERJ-145 airplanes have to performed by May 23rd 2008. Both elevator control cables were found broken on that airplane as result of gale force winds while the airplane was parked. In addition, the FAA received additional reports of in flight failures of the mechanical gust locks.The FAA got concerned, that the mechanical gust locks, thought to protect the control surfaces and components of the elevator control system, could produce so high inertial loads in the elevator control system, that systematic damage could occur capable of ultimately failing the elevator controls.http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAD.nsf/0/46500100761BE2F48625744300547343?OpenDocument

A FlyBE Dash 8-400, registration G-JECG performing flight BE688 from Edinburg to Belfast City with 71 passengers and 4 crew, encountered multiple instrument failures shortly before reaching FL160 after takeoff while climbing through heavy precipitation in icy conditions, the failures consistent with freezing of the pitot/static ports. A Pan-Pan was declared and the airplane descended to FL80, where instrument operations returned to normal. The flight was then continued to Belfast.The AAIB concluded, that a switch to turn the standby pitot heating on was missed and in the OFF position and turned on later while going through the various icing checklists, though both pilots claim, the switch was on and they did not move the switch.Contributory factorsA combination of non-standard use of the checklist, distraction on the flight deck and external pressure contributed to the aircraft taking off with the pitot/static probe heat switches incorrectly selected OFF. A high workload during the climb in poor weather and heavy icing conditions probably contributed to further missed checklist actions, such that the aircraft climbed to its cruising level without the omission being noticed. The resulting instrument failure indications and subsequent recovery of information were consistent with the probe heat switches being OFF until after the incident had occurred. The position of the CWP meant that, under specific circumstances, it may not have been readily obvious to the crew that pitot heat caution lights were illuminated.http://www.aaib.dft.gov.uk/cms_resources/DHC-8-402,%20G-JECG%2004-08.pdf
A BMI British Midland Embraer 145, registration G-RJXA performing flight BD369 from Aberdeen to Manchester with 16 passengers and 4 crew, returned to Aberdeen after smoke developed in the cockpit about 4.5 minutes after takeoff and the captain's PFD, MD and EICAS went blank. The crew did not don the oxygen masks. The aircraft safely landed 15 minutes after becoming airborne.The AAIB posts following conclusions in form of an analysis:AnalysisThis incident was as a result of a No 1 IC-600 failure. It appeared, initially, to have been reasonably handled, in that the aircraft was landed and evacuated within 15 minutes of the initial appearance of smoke. However, upon closer analysis of the procedures employed by the crew during the recovery to Aberdeen, a number of important omissions became apparent that could have had very serious consequences.Crews actionsThe crew did not don their oxygen masks and establish communications at the first sign of smoke, as required in the operators Operations Manual and the aircrafts QRH. They should have done this irrespective of the amount of smoke present. Had they done this the crew would have been protected from any invisible gases that might have been present during the recovery (the smell persisted for some time). This potentially endangered themselves, the cabin crew and the passengers. If the crew subsequently felt giddy they might have become incapacitated and thus been unable to put on their masks without assistance. Once the smoke started to appear, they had no way of knowing whether it would stop quickly or continue to fill the cockpit.The commander attempted to do the Smoke Evacuation checklist from memory and only completed two items, from the middle of the checklist. He informed the co‑pilot that he was doing it, rather than discussing with him whether it was a sensible course of action, thus showing poor Crew Resource Management. Having done this, he did not refer to the QRH to clarify if these actions were correct. The Smoke Evacuation checklist is to be used once the source of the smoke has been identified and extinguished. The aim of the checklist is to increase the airflow through the aircraft so as to evacuate the smoke overboard. If the smoke was still being generated the increased airflow could have fanned the source and exacerbated the situation.Throughout the descent, while the commander was PNF, he handled all communications with ATC and the cabin crew. Had he given control of this communication to the co-pilot, he would have reduced his workload and probably have given himself time to refer to the QRH. There was no fault diagnosis of the commanders blank screens. As a result the Display Failure/IC-600 failure checklist was not completed. Had the commander completed this checklist he would have had his PFD, MFD and EICAS restored to him. This would have made it much easier for him to monitor the co-pilots flying. As they were in IMC, and he landed the aircraft using the standby instruments, this would have been prudent. The commanders request to the co-pilot to contact the cabin crew at 300 ft aal was inappropriate. As the commander landed the aircraft using the standby instruments, the co-pilot should have been closely monitoring the commander during the final stages of the approach.The crew correctly believed, during the later stages of the descent, that the smoke had stopped being generated, despite the lingering smell. Therefore they had as much time as they needed to complete all the necessary checklists before landing the aircraft.The crews actions should have been to don their oxygen masks, establish communications, complete the Air Conditioning Smoke or Electrical System Fire Or Smoke checklist, as they saw appropriate, then the Display Failure checklist, followed by the Smoke Evacuation checklist, if smoke was still present. Once these were complete they could then take their masks off, one at a time, to make sure there were no longer noxious fumes present, or land with their oxygen masks on.Crew trainingCrews train in the simulator, during appropriate situations, with oxygen masks on, so that when it comes to a real incident they are able to operate the aircraft unhindered while wearing them.The correct use of the QRH checklist is instilled into crews during their initial and recurrent training. These checklists are carefully developed and tested by the aircraft manufacturer and are designed to keep the crew and the aircraft safe. If crews create their own procedures they run a risk of going into unknown situations, for which they do not have training or QRH checklists, that could have serious consequences.http://www.aaib.dft.gov.uk/cms_resources/Embraer%20EMB-145EP,%20G-RJXA%2004-08.pdf

A Pinnacle Airlines Canadair CRJ-200 on behalf of NorthWest Airlines, registration N821AY performing flight FLG5737 from Boston to Memphis with 37 passengers, had to divert to Tupelo Regional airport near Memphis, because one of the tyres had blown after takeoff and weather at Memphis was too bad.http://www.djournal.com/pages/story.asp?ID=271091&pub=1÷=Newshttp://flightaware.com/live/flight/FLG5737/history/20080403/1433Z/KBOS/KTUP
An Air Berlin Fokker 100 (actually owned by airline Germania), registration D-AGPE performing flight AB6368 from Munich to Hannover with 40 passengers, diverted to Berlin Tegel (Germania's tech base) after the tyre on one of the two nose wheels blew shortly after takeoff from Munich. The crew elected to fly to their home base instead of returning to Munich or carry on to Hannover, where they performed a safe landing. The passengers were then bussed to Hannover.German: http://www.welt.de/welt_print/article1858225/Bugrad_geplatzt_Notlandung_auf_dem_Airport_Tegel.html
The crew of a SAAB SF340B, registration VH-RXE belonging to Australian Airline "Rex Regional Express", reported that shortly after takeoff from Sydney Airport, NSW, they observed a zero reading on the left torque gauge and advised air traffic control that they were returning to land. During the approach, the crew made a PAN broadcast and advised that the left engine had been shut down. After landing the crew reported that they experienced airframe vibration and suspected a tyre had blown on landing. An inspection by emergency services personnel did not find any damage to the tyres and the crew taxied the aircraft to the terminal apron.An examination of the aircraft systems could not find any reason for the zero reading on the left torque gauge, but the left digital engine control unit was replaced. A review of the crews actions after they observed the loss of torque indication on the left torque gauge, found that they had selected the autocoarsen switch to ON, prior to landing. That was contrary to directions in the flight crew operations manual that required the switch to be selected OFF when torque gauge indications read zero or were erratic. Consequently, the left propeller blades were automatically coarsened, effectively feathering the left propeller and resulted in an asymmetric landing.The operator issued a notice to its aircrew reminding them of the requirement in the flight crew operations manual to not select autocoarsen in these circumstances.http://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/investigation_reports/2006/AAIR/aair200605561.aspx

An Air New Zealand B737-300, registration ZK-NGJ performing flight NZ503 from Auckland to Christchurch with 96 passengers and 5 crew, suffered the failure of a relais resulting in loss of battery bus power during the takeoff run. During climb out the crew identified an increasing number of malfunctions and decided to return to Auckland. After landing the aircraft started to fill with smoke, so that the commander ordered the evacuation of the aircraft. No injuries occured.The New Zealand TAIC has released the final report at:http://www.taic.org.nz/AviationReports/tabid/78/ctl/Detail/mid/482/InvNumber/2006-003/Page/0/Default.aspx?SkinSrc=[G]skins%2ftaicAviation%2fskin_aviation3 FindingsFindings are listed in order of development and not in order of priority.3.1 The aircraft was serviceable and correctly crewed for the flight.3.2 The flight and cabin crews were appropriately qualified, fit and rested for the flight.3.3 An R1 electrical relay failure caused the loss of power to the battery bus, which in turn caused a loss of power to numerous items of equipment and indications.3.4 The failure of the electrical relay occurred during the take-off when the flight crew did not have time to identify the fault immediately.3.5 The timing of the escalating failures at a critical phase of flight, during take-off and while under radar control, created a high workload for the pilots which made troubleshooting the failures more difficult.3.6 The pilots actions in abandoning the flight and returning to land as soon as possible were appropriate.3.7 The indications noticed by the pilots following departure were indicative of an electrical failure of some sort. A better first-hand knowledge of the contents of the QRH should have directed the pilots to the battery bus failure checklist, which would have resolved the emergency at an early stage of the flight.3.8 The aircraft was capable of safe flight even with the loss of battery bus power.3.9 The evidence suggested that the failure of the electrical relay was caused by its contacts releasing through a combination of vibration and low holding force.3.10 The evidence available pointed to the relay failure having its origins at manufacture, which led to its condition progressively deteriorating over time.3.11 The relay manufacturing fault appeared to be isolated.3.12 Given the number of known and unknown causes of R1 relay failures, confidence in the performance of the relay needs to be supported by statistical data.3.13 The smoke that entered the aircraft were from residue oil and other material that overheated in the air conditioning system, which reduced as soon as the aircraft engines were shut down.3.14 Although in hindsight the use of only 3 slides was adequate for this evacuation, without the knowledge of what was causing the smoke, the crew should have followed standard operating procedures and used all available or suitable exits.3.15 The evacuation time could have been reduced by: the reallocation of resources, including the repositioning of cabin crew; the use of all the exits; and a more urgent initial approach to the evacuation.3.16 Unable to identify the cause of the in-flight emergency and then confronted with smoke appearing in the aircraft after landing, the crew would have been wise to initiate an immediate and rapid evacuation.

A Thomsonfly B757, registration G-BYAW enroute to Lanzarote with 221 passengers, suffered the strikes of two herons into the right engine, shortly after takeoff from runway 06L. The engine started to pulse with flames and smoke and was shut down as the aircraft climbed out. The aircraft returned safely to runway 06R after being airborne for about 45 minutes (crew declared Mayday immediately after bird strike).http://www.photos.aero/photos.php?ItemId=37307A spokesman for the airport later told press, it was not the engine on fire, but the birds ...http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/manchester/6606375.stm
An A310 (registration AP-BDZ) of Pakistan International Airlines, flight PK-340 with more than 100 passengers bound for Faisalabad, returned to Karachi a few minutes after takeoff, as the airplane encountered severe mismatches between left and right hand air speed readings, affecting both autopilot and engine control. The airplane had reached about 1000 meters (3000 feet) of altitude when the airplane on autopilot started to sink again. During the following emergency landing several tires blew. Reports are unclear about what happened in addition, Pakistan news sources reporting, the nose of the airplane touched the ground producing damage on the nose gear - which would suggest, the nose gear collapsed on landing. Other reports suggest, the airplane landed nose gear first.No injuries were reported, all passengers continued their journey a few hours later on a replacement aircraft.
An United B767-300, flight UA843 from Chicago to Sao Paulo with 165 passengers, suffered several bird strikes during takeoff past V1, setting engine #1 on fire. The crew shut down the engine after takeoff and the airplane returned to Chicago safely about 30 minutes later.http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-070315united-flight,1,739437.story?track=rss&ctrack=1&cset=trueAccording to Jacdec United engineers later determined, that both engines ingested several large birds, remains of the birds were also found in engine #2.http://www.jacdec.de/news/news.htm

The crew of a Continental B777, flight CO 84 with 260 passengers and 16 crew bound for Tel Aviv, decided to reject takeoff from Newark after the right hand engine disintegrated during the takeoff run. The aircraft came to a safe stop.http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjczN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk2MDgmZmdiZWw3Zjd2cWVlRUV5eTcwOTcwNDYmeXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXky
A B737, operated by Batavia Airlines for Garuda, bound to fly from Palangkaraya (Borneo) to Jakarta, rejected takeoff after flames and sparks were seen from the right hand side during the takeoff run. Despite passenger reports the airplane never got airborne and stopped on the runway (2100 meters long).
An Air Canada A320, flight 547 from Las Vegas to Calgary, rejected takeoff at 110 KIAS, after tires at the left main gear "disintegrated", the remainder of the left main gear assembly "grooving" the runway and resulting in another tire burst on the nose gear. The pieces of that tire apparently went through both engines ... The airplane ended up sticking on the runway for 17 hours with a badly damaged main left gear and both engines damaged.The crew had reported about half an hour earlier, that their brakes were hot, and pulled the aircraft out of the departure queue, attempting takeoff roughly 30 minutes later, 35 minutes past scheduled departure time.All people on board left the airplane via stairs, no injuries were reported.
An Airbus A310 of Biman Bangladesh Airlines, flight BG006 with 236 passengers and crew from Dubai to Dhaka, rejected takeoff from runway 12L at Dubai after a loud bang was heard and the nose gear collapsed. The aircraft stopped on the runway. The plane was evacuated via slides. 13 passengers are reported injured.As a result Dubai airport has been closed and will remain closed minimum until 9:30 GMT (minimum 8 hours closure).Airlines currently operate from Ras Al Khaimah International Airport, located 40 minutes from Abu Dhabi, bussing passengers to and from Dubai Airport.Airport officials said (not revealing their identity, as they are not authorised to talk to media), that a tire burst causing the nose gear to collapse. Sources at the civil defense said, that "two of the airplane's engines were on fire" (personal remark: since when has the A310 more than two engines?) and "one of the gear axles broke" during aborted takeoff. Rumours out of Dubai suggest, that the airplane has hit a "foreign object" during takeoff, causing the nose gear to collapse.
A Hapag Fly B737 with 188 passengers on board was about to takeoff to Hannover, when it lost two wheels during the takeoff run. The takeoff was rejected and the passengers evacuated. The airport was closed for about 7 hours until the airplane could be moved off the runway. No injuries were reported.German article: http://islacanaria.net/index.php/content/view/3018//
The captain of Continental Airlines Flight 1838, a B737-900 (ER?) enroute from Houston, Texas to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico with 210 passengers, fell ill shortly after takeoff, collapsed and later died.

The cause of the sudden illness has not been announced by the airline.
The presidential airplane of Kyrgyz, a TU-154M, collided with a KC-135 fuel tanker of the US military, while taking off from Manas Airport at Beshkek. Parts of the right wing of the TU-154 broke off, the KC-135 was set on fire. The TU-154 however continued its takeoff, flew a circuit and returned to land in a crash landing.No "victims" were reported. It is unclear, whether the airplane carried any politicians.http://www.kommersant.com/page.asp?idr=530&id=708244
A Fokker 100 of Brasilian Airline TAM with 79 people on board, bound for Rio de Janeiro, had to return to Sao Paulo, after one of its door detached in flight and fell off, nearly hitting a supermarket on the ground. The airplane landed safely about 18 minutes after takeoff. No injuries were reported.There are some additional reports, that a flight attendant, standing nearby the door, was nearly sucked out of the airplane as well, but could be held inside the cabine.Other reports suggest, that the flight crew had already noticed problems before the door actually fell off and had already turned their airplane back.TAM is said to replace its Fokker fleet as of current, but is also said, that because of the demise of other Brazilian airlines they currently face increased demand with deliveries of new aircraft being too slow to keep up with the increased demand. This raises concerns over maintenance.
A Quatar Airways A330, registration A7-ACI, suffered a dual engine flame out as it just climbed through 21000 feet after takeoff from Shanghai.The crew was eventually able to relight both engines and landed.More details are unknown at this point, like destination, people on board or the reason for the dual flameout.
A B737 of Adam Air with 145 passengers was lost over Java, after communication and navigation equipment failed 20 minutes after takeoff from Jakarta. The crew spotted a small airfield on the island of Sumba 4 hours after takeoff and performed a safe landing on that 1800 meters (6000 feet) long runway.Indonesia's Transport Ministry as well as Boeing are launching an investigation into the incident.http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/jet-lost-for-hours-over-java-after-navigation-system-failed/2006/02/12/1139679478462.htmlhttp://www.thejakartapost.com/detailnational.asp?fileid=20060212.A03&irec=2
British Airways Flight BA8703, a BAe Avro RJ-100, from Edinburgh to London with 86 people on board, initiated an evacuation immediately preceeding takeoff, when ground personnel noticed "something which gave cause for concern".

An Emirates A340-300, registration A6-ERN, flight number EK-764 with 260 passengers and 14 crew, overran the runway 21R (length 11115 feet, temperature at the time of accident was 15C) on takeoff by roughly 490 feet (150 Meters) before getting airborne on 20th of April 2004 (20 months ago). The aircraft hit approach lighting and was seriously damaged (flaps damaged and locked, gear and fuselage damaged), but managed to return for a safe landing on runway 21L, resulting in no injuries.South African Accident investigators heavily criticized Emirates Airline's training and rostering practises. Both pilots made their only second flight on type, the captain did his first flight in command. The Captain was pilot flying and used an erroneous takeoff technique, that he had heard as a training "tip" for achieving accurate rotation. This tip however delayed rotation preventing the airplane from getting airborne.The tip suggested to move the Sidestick Order Indicator to the +9 degrees angle indicator on the PFD. As the airplane starts to pitch up, this would trigger release of stick pressure counteracting rotation.http://www.flightinternational.com/Articles/2006/01/10/Navigation/177/203980/Emirates+censured+in+Airbus+A340+Johannesburg+runway+overrun.html
A Southwest B737, flight 111 from Chicago Midway to Philadelphia, had to divert to Chicago O'Hare Airport after the airplane ingested a bird into its engine, forcing the crew to shut down the engine, during takeoff from Midway.

A Boeing 767-332, registration N175DN, of Delta Airlines with 158 passengers and 11 crew, flight 76 bound for Atlanta, returned to Zürich Airport after an engine failed during takeoff. The overweight landing was safe, no injuries reported.The airplane had taken off shortly after 22:00 local, reported engine trouble immediately after takeoff and returned to the airport, performing an overweight landing at 22:19 local. Several tires deflated, the airport fire engines needed to cool the brakes.http://www.blick.ch/news/schweiz/news11910Photo off the airport WebCam:
A Midwest Boeing 717, flight number 210 bound for Milwaukee with 86 passengers and 4 crew, had to return to Boston Logan after it encountered tire damage on its right main landing gear. The pilot circled for two hours to burn off fuel and then returned (takeoff and landing runway unknown). Landing, although in sparks, was safe, no injuries.http://edition.cnn.com/2005/US/12/20/plane.logan.ap.ap/index.htmlVideo at: http://edition.cnn.com/video/us/2005/12/20/ma.midwest.plane.landing.at.logan.whdh/content.exclude.html
A B747-400 of Air India, bound for Frankfurt/Germany with 263 people on board, had to return to Los Angeles International Airport after the plane suffered tire damage on its right main landing gear on takeoff on runway 25R. The airplane dumped fuel for about an hour over the Pacific. During the landing roll on runway 25L all tires on right main landing gear burst, the crew managed a smooth roll out however amongst a lot of sparks.Passengers walked off the airplane via stairs, no injuries. The right main landing gear was seriously damaged.Both runways 25L and 25R at LAX are currently closed, airport authorities currently working to reopen 25R, the takeoff runway, clearing it from debris and repairing damage.Report and Video of the landing at:http://cbs2.com/topstories/local_story_354022709.html
At 0846 Eastern Standard Time on 20 October 2005, the crew of a Korean Airlines Boeing 777-2B5ER aircraft (777), registered HL-7530, was cleared to takeoff from runway 34 left (34L) at Sydney Airport for a scheduled passenger flight to South Korea. About 30 seconds later, the driver of an aircraft tug towing a B747-400 (747) freighter that had stopped at the holding point on taxiway Alpha 1 on the western side of runway 34L, commenced to cross the runway (see Figure 1). The aerodrome control west (ADC W) controller saw the tug crossing the runway as the 777 rotated abeam taxiway Alpha 4. The 777 become airborne adjacent to taxiway Bravo 8 and passed over the towed 747 on the runway at an estimated height of 400 ft.http://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/investigation_reports/2005/AAIR/aair200505170.aspxNote: the comments by the Australian investigation board are misleading by using "Boeing Company 777" and "Boeing Company 747-400" suggesting, that the airplanes were operated by Boeing Company rather than being manufactured by Boeing. The report itsself never identifies Korean Airlines (only the registration HL-7530 makes identification of that airline possible) and never identifies the airline or registration of the B744.
On its flight from Paris Charles de Gaulle to Birmingham one flight attendant of Birtish European's BAe 146-200 with 75 passengers and 5 crew was informed by two passengers in the rear shortly after takeoff, that they observed unusual "oily petrol" smells. This claim was supported by another positioning crew in the front right of the cabine. The F/A however could not detect anything abnormal, however informed the flight deck. After another checking no unusual smells could be observed by the crew and flight attendant, the flight continued.Towards the end of the cruise at FL 240 the captain left his seat to enter the cabine and visit the toilet. He didn't notice any abnormal smells and stood in the cabine with the flight attendant for several minutes, when he noticed that the descent had been initiated by the first officer, who was pilot flying on this leg. When the captain returned to the cockpit, the first officer visited the toilet, too. When he entered back into the cockpit however the first officer felt nauseous, and became progressively worse in his seat, feeling light headed. Soon after he started trembling. At that time the captain started to feel nauseous too, observed his first officer being completely white and got the first officer on oxygen. The first officer did not take any part in the remainder of the flight, and started to recover only after the airplane was on the ground and the cockpit windows had been opened. The use of oxygen did not help his condition at all.The commander requested flight attendants to inspect the cockpit regularly and at high frequency during descent and approach.The captain became progressively worse as well, however managed to perform the flight and maintain normal radio communication until short final, where he too felt light headed and suffered double vision, having difficulties in judging height. He left the autopilot in charge until 150 feet AGL with full flaps, and then managed a "firm" manual landing. Once on the ground the commander started to feel better.The chief flight attendant reported that she could see "slight haze" throughout the cabine when she entered the cockpit after landing.The AAIB determined, that as a result of an oil leakage from the APU cooling generator fan seal into the APU air stream and into the ECS system ducting. This contamination allowed fumes to develop, a proportion of which entered the cabine and cockpit air supply.http://www.aaib.dft.gov.uk/cms_resources/dft_avsafety_pdf_029646.pdf
French Aviation Accident Investigators BEA have released the final report about a crash, that happened at Cotonou, Benin, performing the investigation on request by the Republic of Benin.Flight GIH 141 (Union des Transportes Africains, UTA) from Cotonou, Benin, to Beirut, Lebanon, was to takeoff, when the first officer remarked to the captain indicating number of passengers: "You have 140. You will see when the aircraft will take off or we will crash on the sea". The airplane did not get airborne due to overload and a far forward CG and crashed on the sea about one minute after starting its takeoff run, killing all but 22 occupants of the plane. The number of fatalities and people on board could not be determined due to lack of paperwork and cooperation from the airline, but is believed at 138 and 3 fatalities on the ground.The report is frightening reading and produces some inside picture of why there are so many accidents in Africa ...http://www.bea-fr.org/docspa/2003/3x-o031225a/pdf/3x-o031225a.pdf
From the accident report:During takeoff from runway 02 at Tamanrasset Aguenar aerodrome, a sharp thump was heard just after rotation. The left engine had just suffered a contained burst. The airplane swung to the left. The Captain took over the controls. The airplane lost speed progressively, stalled and crashed, with the landing gear still extended, about one thousand six hundred and forty-five meters from the takeoff point, to the left of the runway extended centerline.End of quoteFull report (in English) at:http://www.bea-fr.org/docspa/2003/7t-z030306a/pdf/7t-z030306a.pdfFull report (in French) at:http://www.bea-fr.org/docspa/2003/7t-z030306/pdf/7t-z030306.pdf
Spanish Accident Investigators have released their final report on the accident of KLM Flight 1673, a B737-400 from Amsterdam to Barcelona. 5 passengers got injured during the evacuation of the airplane, the airplane was written off.During takeoff, just as the airplane started rotation, a bird hit the nose gear. After takeoff the gear retracted normally, information from the airport was, that the bird appeared to be a small one, the crew went on to Barcelona. Approach and initial landing was normal until the nose gear touched down. From that time on the crew needed to apply more and more right rudder pressure (in the end both pilots stepping into the pedals) to keep the airplane on the runway, one of the pilots even applied differential braking, but the airplane veered off the left and departed the runway at around 85 knots, running over a "step" and unprepared ground, coming to rest just ahead of a ditch 107 meters aside of the runway. The aircraft sustained severe damage and was written off.The investigators concluded, that the bird strike at Amsterdam severed a cable needed to turn the nose gear, having the nose gear jammed at a 17 degree deflection to the left. It was concluded, that the cable was worn out by wrong grease used in maintenance, otherwise the breakage of the cable would not have happened.http://www.fomento.es/NR/rdonlyres/0E5E853B-DE65-4617-B614-A1F76847DC92/13891/2004_070_A_ENG.pdfThe report is also interesting reading regarding passenger behaviour in the evacuation.
A B737-200 of Indonesian airline "Mandala Airlines", flight RI 091, with 117 people on board, bound for Jakarta, crashed into a residential area in the city of Medan just after takeoff. The airplane broke into pieces and caught fire, setting surrounding houses on fire, too.Hospitals in Medan, located in the north of Indonesia's Sumatra Island, reports, that some of the fatalities were residents on the ground. A nurse said, that ambulances keep going back and forth bringing victims, who are both passengers and residents. "Some are still alive, some are dead", she said.The North Sumatra government reports, that there are no survivors. The governor of North Sumatra, the former governor of North Sumatra and the acting governor of Aceh were on board of the plane.The airplane came to rest 500 meters past the runway. Mandala Airlines is Indonesia's oldest private carrier.
