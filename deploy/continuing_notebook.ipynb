The crew transmitted a distress signal.Ground observers reported the aircraft took off and fell followed by an explosion on the ground.Russia's Press Agency TASS reported that preliminary information by emergency services suggests the aircraft had suffered engine (SaM146) failure.Moscow's Transport Prosecution Office have opened an investigation into the crash.Russia's Civil Aviation Authority Rosaviatsia confirmed a SU95 crashed near Moscow, the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC aka MAK) is investigating the occurrence. In the late evening Rosaviatsia added, that both black boxes have been found.Russia's Ministry of Transport (Rosaviatransnador) stated, that the crashed aircraft had no permission to fly.The Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC/MAK) reported they have formed a commission to investigate the crash, the commission has already started working.The aircraft had undergone major maintenance and had positioned to Lukhovitsy on May 3rd 2024 and had not flown since.On Jul 13th 2024 Gazpromavia reported the aircraft had been in a C-Check, additional periodical checks and additional works were to be carried out as well and was on a test flight.On Jul 13th 2024 an official of Rosaviatsia stated, that the aircraft was flying in accordance with the filed flight plan, in accordance with received application and approved by operational bodies of the United Air Traffic Management System along the route Lukhovitsy to Vnukovo.On Jul 13th 2024 the MAK reported that the blackboxes had been delivered to the MAK. The recorders had been exposed to temperature, suffered signficant mechanical damage and needed repairs. After the repair the data have successfully been read out and are now being prepared for decoding and analysis.On Jul 16th 2024 it became known, that on Jul 14th 2024 the aircraft manufacturer had released a letter (see below) reminding operators of the \"the need to strictly comply with the requirements of the manual when replacing angle of attack sensors (25-T341,26-T341,23-T341,24-T341).\" further reiterating: \"During dismantling and installation of the angle of attack sensor pay special attention to aligning the holes and marks on the overlay with the mark on the fuselage skin and re-install the overlay only on the place of the fuselage skin from which it came from during removal.\" and urges operators to double check installations as well as avoid situations where one mechanics would replace more than one angle of attack sensor on the same aircraft.On Jul 22nd 2024 the MAK reported: The crew, consisting of the aircraft commander, second pilot and flight attendant, was flying from Lukhovitsy airfield (Tretyakovo) to the base airfield Vnukovo (Moscow) after performing periodic maintenance by the PAO UAC branch  LAZ named after P.A. Voronin.The autothrottle was engaged before takeoff. The autopilot was engaged after takeoff at a true altitude of 550 feet. In the fifth minute of the flight, from a virtually level flight at a QNH altitude of 5160 feet (pitch angle values ​​were 5-6 degrees to pitch up, recorded angles of attack were 10-11 degrees), the aircraft began to descend with a pitch angle of up to 4 degrees to dive. At the moment of transition to descent, the indicated airspeed was 200 knots and increasing, synchronous retraction of the flaps and slats to the fully retracted position occurred.During the descent, the autopilot and autothrottle were disconnected. The crew switched to manual control of the side stick and engines. The descent continued to an altitude of 4,500 feet, with a subsequent climb to 4,750 feet.In the sixth minute of the flight at a speed of 320 knots (the OVERSPEED sound signal was on), the aircraft began to descend with an increase in the pitch angle to a dive. The descent could not be stopped by the crew despite full backwards (up) deflection of the side stick.Flight parameters recording ceased at 14:59:15, last recorded parameter values: indicated airspeed  365 knots, vertical descent rate  17,000 ft/min, pitch angle  25 degrees to nose-down, bank angle  25 degrees to the right. Power plants operated until parameters recording ceased.On Jul 29th 2024 it became known, that Rosaviatsia had asked Gazpromavia to stop using one of their SU95s, tail number RA-89029, after inspections of the maintenance facilities at Lukhovitsy. The facility had won contracts to provide C-Checks to two Gazpromavia SU95s, one of which was the crashed one. The work on that second aircraft began on Mar 20th 2024 and ended on May 6th 2024, however, measurements on play of rudders and elevators had not been fully performed and the test results were not recorded. Besides several more such violations of maintenance procedures it was also found, that the works were supervised by an unqualified employee.The crash site is about 16nm past the runway 28 end at Lukhovitsy in approximate runway direction.The crash site (Photo: 112):The crash site on the ground:Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):The service letter by the manufacturer page 1 (Graphics: Yakovlev/Sukhoi):The service letter by the manufacturer page 2 (Graphics: Yakovlev/Sukhoi):\n",

There were possible problems with the landing gear, according to first testimony by the captain a tyre/wheel failed causing the aircraft to veer left.Colombia's DIACC released their final report in Spanish only (Editorial note: to serve the purpose of global prevention of the repeat of causes leading to an occurrence an additional timely release of all occurrence reports in the only world spanning aviation language English would be necessary, a Spanish only or no release does not achieve this purpose as set by ICAO annex 13 and just forces many aviators to waste much more time and effort each in trying to understand the circumstances leading to the occurrence. Aviators operating internationally are required to read/speak English besides their local language, investigators need to be able to read/write/speak English to communicate with their counterparts all around the globe).The report concludes the probable causes of the accident were:a lateral runway excursion leading to loss of control caused by the sudden loss of pressure of the left main landing gear tyre due to the puncture by an iron rod located on the runway surfaced.Contributing factors were:Deficient runway safety at the aerodrome, foreign object debris on the runway, due to the lack of maintenance programme and absence of a perimeter fence and lack of foreign object debris prevention programme.Deficient conditions of safety areas with irregular, uneven and waterlogged surface contributing to the aircraft damage.Non-observance by aerodrome administration of a final report's safety recommendations in a previous occurrence of 2018, also due to the presence of foreign object debris on the runway.
